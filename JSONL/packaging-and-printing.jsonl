By 2030, outlets will be required to facilitate consumer use of personal containers and aim to offer at least 10% of their products in reusable packaging.</p> \n<p>This not only encourages a shift in consumer behaviour but also stimulates businesses to invest in more sustainable packaging solutions.</p> \n<h3>Recyclable packaging, better waste collection and recycling</h3> \n<p>The regulations stipulate that all packaging must meet stringent recyclability criteria by 2030, with the exception of materials like wood, cork, and ceramics.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, ambitious recycling targets have been established, including the stipulation that 90% of single-use plastic and metal beverage containers must be collected separately by 2029, ensuring efficient recycling processes.</p> \n<h3>A healthier future and economic implications</h3> \n<p>The rapporteur, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries, highlighted the dual benefit of these new rules: not only do they reduce environmental impact, but they also safeguard consumer health by banning hazardous substances in food contact materials.</p> \n<p>This legislative milestone marks the EU\u2019s firm commitment to reducing the use of harmful materials and fostering innovation in the packaging industry.</p> \n<p>The economic implications are profound. In 2018, the packaging sector generated a turnover of \u20ac355 billion within the EU. However, without intervention, waste is projected to rise sharply.</p> \n<p>By implementing these measures, the EU aims not only to reduce environmental degradation but also to stimulate economic growth through innovative, sustainable practices.</p> \n<h3>A call to action</h3> \n<p>The new packaging regulations represent a bold step forward in the EU\u2019s environmental agenda, reflecting a strong public desire for more sustainable practices and stricter regulations as voiced during the Conference on the Future of Europe.</p> \n<p>With the Council\u2019s formal approval pending, the anticipation builds for these measures to take effect, setting a global benchmark in packaging waste management.</p> \n<p>This is not merely a legislative change but a call to action for industries, governments, and individuals to unite in the battle against packaging waste.</p> \n<p>By embracing these changes, the EU hopes to foster a cleaner, greener future for all its citizens, inspiring other regions to follow suit in this vital environmental endeavour.</p> \n"}]}

This absence of oxygen is key in preventing the growth of aerobic microorganisms such as moulds and bacteria, which can lead to food spoilage.</p> \n<p>Moreover, it helps in maintaining the food\u2019s organoleptic properties\u2014its taste, texture, and nutritional value\u2014which are often compromised in other preservation methods such as heat treatment.</p> \n<p>The technology behind vacuum sealing is straightforward yet effective. Food items are placed in specially designed bags or containers from which the air is evacuated before sealing.</p> \n<p>This method not only\u00a0keeps food edible for up to five times longer than traditional storage methods\u00a0but also ensures that the food\u2019s nutritive qualities are not degraded by oxidation.</p> \n<p>This process is beneficial not just for storage but also complements other food preservation techniques, such as pasteurisation or freezing, enhancing their effectiveness while potentially reducing the need for chemical preservatives.</p> \n<h2>Reducing food waste</h2> \n<p>Globally, nearly a third of all food produced is discarded, according to Alcimed\u2019s report. This statistic highlights a severe inefficiency in our food supply chain and represents a substantial environmental and economic issue.</p> \n<p>Vacuum packaging directly addresses this problem by improving the shelf life of food products, which in turn reduces the likelihood of food being thrown away.</p> \n<p>In recent years, vacuum sealing technology has become more accessible to the average consumer, with affordable and easy-to-use machines now available for home use.</p> \n<p>These devices allow individuals to store perishable items more effectively, thereby reducing personal food waste. Furthermore, the options for consumers now include not only single-use plastic bags but also reusable containers that offer a more sustainable choice.</p> \n<h2>Streamlining logistics and reducing energy use</h2> \n<p>Vacuum packaging also plays a pivotal role in the logistics of food distribution, especially for foods that need to be transported over long distances or internationally.</p> \n<p>By extending the freshness of products without the need for constant refrigeration, vacuum packaging can reduce the energy required to maintain the cold chain during transport.</p> \n<p>This method is particularly beneficial for \u201cclimacteric\u201d fruits like mangoes and pineapples, which are often harvested before they are fully ripe to endure long shipping durations.</p> \n<p>With vacuum packaging, these fruits can be allowed to ripen and then sealed, maintaining their quality and reducing the need for energy-intensive air transport.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, by limiting exposure to the air, vacuum packaging can prevent maceration\u2014a common issue during the container shipping of fruits and vegetables caused by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.</p> \n<p>This not only reduces waste but also improves the energy efficiency of shipping these goods.</p> \n<h2>Seizing the opportunity for further environmental benefits</h2> \n<p>As we grapple with the dual challenges of environmental sustainability and efficient food distribution, vacuum packaging offers a viable solution that tackles both.</p> \n<p>It extends food freshness, reduces waste, and lessens our reliance on energy-consuming preservation methods. With ongoing advancements in sustainable and reusable packaging options, the potential for further environmental benefits is significant.</p> \n<p>The journey towards more sustainable food systems is complex and multifaceted, but innovations like vacuum packaging play a crucial role.</p> \n"}]}

Many companies, perhaps unwittingly, complicate their operations by engaging multiple suppliers for their packaging needs.</p> \n<p>This can lead to a myriad of issues including increased costs, inefficiencies, and compromised quality. Understanding the reasons for consolidating your packaging suppliers can be the first step towards optimising your business operations.</p> \n<h2>Reasons to consolidate your packaging</h2> \n<h3>Simplified management and reduced costs</h3> \n<p>The most straightforward reason to consolidate suppliers is to simplify the management of your packaging needs and reduce costs.</p> \n<p>Dealing with a plethora of suppliers can be a logistical nightmare. Each supplier has its own invoicing and delivery schedules, leading to a complex web of transactions to manage.</p> \n<p>By reducing the number of suppliers, companies can cut down on administrative overheads and reduce errors associated with handling multiple accounts.</p> \n<p>Consolidation also provides an opportunity to negotiate better terms due to higher volume purchases from a single supplier, potentially leading to significant cost savings.</p> \n<p>Moreover, it minimises the risks and costs associated with the inconsistency of product quality and supply.</p> \n<h3>Enhanced quality and compatibility</h3> \n<p>When purchasing\u00a0packaging materials\u00a0from multiple sources, there\u2019s often a risk that these components won\u2019t work well together. This can affect the protection that the packaging is supposed to provide, leading to increased product damage and returns.</p> \n<p>Consolidating suppliers means your packaging materials are likely to be more compatible and of consistent quality, as they are designed and sourced to work together seamlessly.</p> \n<h3>Improved supplier relationships</h3> \n<p>Working with fewer suppliers can lead to stronger relationships and better service.</p> \n<p>With a larger portion of your business at stake, a consolidated supplier is more likely to view your account as critical, prompting better service, priority on product availability, and more willing cooperation in developing custom solutions that fit your specific needs.</p> \n<h2>Considerations and advantages of single sourcing</h2> \n<h3>Increased efficiency across the board</h3> \n<p>A single-source supplier can offer a holistic view of your packaging process, potentially identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement that were not apparent when dealing with multiple suppliers.</p> \n<p>This might include streamlining your packaging designs to improve the packing and shipping process or managing inventory more effectively to avoid overstocking or stockouts.</p> \n<h3>Better forecasting and support</h3> \n<p>With a consolidated view of your operations, a single supplier can better forecast your needs and manage stock levels more accurately, which can be crucial for businesses dealing with seasonal fluctuations or rapid growth.</p> \n<p>This can also facilitate a just-in-time delivery model, which reduces the need for large warehouse spaces and helps in managing cash flow more effectively.</p> \n<h3>Long-term strategic benefits</h3> \n<p>Consolidating your packaging suppliers can also provide strategic advantages.</p> \n<p>A dedicated supplier is more likely to invest in understanding your business and may provide innovation and technology advancements that can benefit your products.</p> \n<p>They are also more likely to be responsive and flexible to your changing needs.</p> \n<h2>The potential pitfalls to avoid</h2> \n<p>While the benefits of supplier consolidation are clear, there are potential pitfalls that businesses need to navigate.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest risks is vendor lock-in, where a company becomes so dependent on a single supplier that switching becomes difficult and costly.</p> \n<p>This can be mitigated by carefully drafting contracts that ensure flexibility and by maintaining a relationship that allows for periodic reassessment of terms.</p> \n<p>Supplier inflexibility can also be a concern, particularly with larger suppliers. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that the supplier\u2019s culture and operational structure are aligned with your business needs.</p> \n<p>Regular communication and feedback can help ensure that the supplier remains responsive to your requirements.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, while transitioning to a single-source packaging supplier involves careful planning and consideration, the potential benefits in cost savings, efficiency, and improved product quality make it a compelling strategy for businesses looking to optimise their operations.</p> \n<p>Properly executed, supplier consolidation can not only streamline your packaging supply chain but also provide a strategic advantage in the marketplace.</p> \n"}]}

Each of these examples demonstrates how integrating totemic design can elevate a product from merely being a commodity to becoming a piece of art that consumers are proud to display.</p> \n<p>The rise of totemic packaging in the 2025/26 season heralds a transformative era in consumer goods, where packaging transcends its traditional role and becomes a pivotal aspect of the product experience. This trend not only challenges brands to innovate aesthetically but also to embed deeper cultural and emotional significance into their packaging designs. As we\u2019ve seen, totemic packaging is not merely about visual appeal; it\u2019s a holistic strategy that encompasses sustainability, cultural resonance, and emotional engagement. By embracing this trend, brands can create more than just products; they can offer unique, meaningful experiences that resonate with consumers on a personal level. As the market continues to evolve, totemic packaging stands as a beacon for brands aiming to foster a profound connection with their audience, turning everyday interactions into lasting impressions.

This scale of production transformed the food industry, making preserved foods accessible and affordable to the general population.</p> \n<p>It also spurred innovations in can design, including the introduction of the two-piece and three-piece cans, which improved the efficiency and safety of canning.</p> \n<h2>Modern can systems and sustainability</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s steel cans are marvels of engineering, designed for durability and sustainability. Modern can-making involves sophisticated techniques such as electrochemical coating and electric seam welding, which have significantly improved the quality and safety of canned goods.</p> \n<p>Additionally, contemporary cans may feature lacquers or polymeric linings to prevent corrosion and protect the integrity of their contents.</p> \n<p>Steel cans offer several environmental benefits. They are 100% recyclable, and recycling rates in Europe exceed 72%. The recycling process is efficient, preserving the metal\u2019s quality and drastically reducing the environmental footprint associated with can production.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the hermetic sealing of cans protects food from light, oxygen, and moisture, extending shelf life without the need for preservatives and reducing food waste.</p> \n<h2>The future of steel packaging</h2> \n<p>Despite competition from newer materials like plastics and aluminium, steel remains a cornerstone of the packaging industry due to its recyclability and the robust protection it offers.</p> \n<p>However, the industry must continue to innovate to meet changing consumer demands and environmental standards. The rise of green consumerism and the push towards sustainable packaging solutions pose challenges but also opportunities for the steel can industry.</p> \n<p>As we look to the future, the steel can\u2019s ability to adapt will be crucial. Innovations in can design that reduce material use while maintaining functionality, such as easy-open ends and improved recyclability, will help steel maintain its relevance in an increasingly competitive market.</p> \n<p>Moreover, understanding and responding to consumer preferences for less processed and fresher food options will be vital.</p> \n<p>Steel cans have been an integral part of our food supply chain for over 200 years, demonstrating remarkable durability and adaptability.</p> \n<p>As the packaging industry evolves, the resilience and sustainability of steel will continue to be its greatest strengths, ensuring that it remains a vital part of our daily lives.</p> \n"}]}

If scaled, these technologies could make a massive dent in atmospheric carbon levels.</p> \n<p>Korea\u2019s LG Chem debuted cosmetic packaging made from polyethylene carbonate (PEC) derived from factory emissions. Plastipak says its PET resin is the first made from captured carbon. Even packaging pigments are evolving \u2013 like Graviky Labs\u2019 Air Ink which stores atmospheric carbon in black pigments.</p> \n<h2>Net zero by the numbers</h2> \n<p>The time for incrementalism is past \u2013 nothing short of a packaging revolution will keep global warming under 2\u00b0C as outlined in the Paris Agreement. With current trajectories, emissions are set to fall just 10% by 2030, far short of the 43% reduction needed. The consequences couldn\u2019t be starker \u2013 from 99% of coral reefs dying off to millions displaced by rising seas if warming exceeds 2\u00b0C by 2100.</p> \n<p>The good news is 90% of consumers say sustainability is important for choosing brands. Those making legitimate ESG claims are growing at twice the rate of competitors. The opportunity \u2013 and imperative \u2013 couldn\u2019t be clearer for brands to embrace net-zero packaging now.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The road to net-zero packaging is still long, but leading brands are showing the way with material innovations, waste reduction, and carbon capture technologies. Whether swapping plastic for paper, lightweighting and right-sizing packs, or incorporating carbon-storing materials, myriad opportunities exist to dramatically decarbonize packaging. With time running out to avert the worst climate impacts, brands can\u2019t afford to delay the net-zero packaging transition. Those who move decisively now stand to win the loyalty of climate-conscious consumers and secure their relevance for a carbon-constrained future.</p> \n"}]}

A\u00a0circular economy\u00a0aims to redefine growth, focusing on positive society-wide benefits.</p> \n<p>It entails gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, and designing waste out of the system. Underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic, natural, and social capital.</p> \n<p>Packaging plays a pivotal role in this framework, providing an intriguing lens through which we can understand and enhance sustainability efforts.</p> \n<h2>The importance of sustainable packaging</h2> \n<p>Packaging is integral to the modern supply chain, protecting goods from manufacturer to market, and communicating directly to consumers.</p> \n<p>However, traditional packaging models are linear: materials are manufactured, used, and then disposed of. In contrast, sustainable packaging strategies are designed to be regenerative, enhancing the ability to recycle and reuse materials.</p> \n<p>Sustainable packaging reduces the environmental impact through several key strategies.</p> \n<p>Firstly, it minimises the use of raw materials. Secondly, it maximises the use of recycled or sustainably sourced materials. Thirdly, it\u2019s designed for reuse, recycling, or composting, ideally maintaining the quality and integrity of the material at each cycle.</p> \n<p>These practices are not just environmentally beneficial but also economically strategic, as they often involve reducing material costs and waste-related expenses.</p> \n<h2>Innovation and design in circular packaging</h2> \n<p>Innovation in packaging design is crucial for the success of a circular economy. Many companies are now investing in research and development to create packaging solutions that are both functional and sustainable.</p> \n<p>This involves the use of new materials and technologies that can be easily recycled or that biodegrade more effectively. For instance, the development of bioplastics has seen considerable advancement.</p> \n<p>These plastics, derived from natural materials like corn starch or sugarcane, can offer similar qualities to traditional plastics but are generally more environmentally friendly when disposed of correctly.</p> \n<p>Moreover, design considerations are now increasingly focusing on the end of the packaging\u2019s life cycle. Design for disassembly is a growing approach where products are designed so that they can easily be broken down into their component materials, which can then be recycled separately.</p> \n<p>This not only facilitates recycling but also maximises the purity and quality of the recyclable materials, thereby supporting a more robust circular system.</p> \n<h2>Challenges and opportunities</h2> \n<p>While there are many opportunities within circular economy models for packaging, there are also significant challenges to overcome.</p> \n<p>One of the primary challenges is the economic and technological feasibility of recycling certain materials. For instance, multi-layered packaging materials that improve shelf life and product safety can be difficult to recycle.</p> \n<p>This calls for a balance between product protection, consumer safety, and environmental sustainability.</p> \n<p>Another challenge is consumer behaviour. Consumer awareness and participation are crucial for the success of circular models. People need to be educated on how to dispose of packaging properly so that it can be successfully reintegrated into the circular system.</p> \n<p>This includes understanding what can be recycled and the importance of things like cleaning food containers before recycling.</p> \n<p>Additionally, regulatory frameworks play a critical role. Governments can support circular economy efforts by creating and enforcing regulations that encourage or require sustainable packaging practices.</p> \n<p>This could include incentives for using recycled materials, or penalties for using non-recyclable packaging.</p> \n<h2>The need for a systemic shift</h2> \n<p>The transition to a circular economy requires a systemic shift in how we view and handle resources, including packaging.</p> \n<p>Packaging, often seen just as a means to an end, actually holds the key to significant environmental impacts. By focusing on sustainable packaging, companies can reduce waste, lower their environmental impact, and create economic opportunities.</p> \n<p>Innovation in this area is flourishing, driven by both emerging technologies and growing consumer demand for sustainable products.</p> \n<p>To truly realise the benefits of a circular economy, it is essential for businesses, consumers, and governments to collaborate. This synergy will not only foster the creation of effective and sustainable packaging solutions but will also propel the shift towards a more resilient and sustainable global economy.</p> \n<p>The journey towards a circular economy is complex and challenging, yet the innovations and opportunities within the realm of packaging suggest a promising path forward.</p> \n"}]}

Without a strong field service team, no matter how great the equipment \u2013 maintaining it is just as important.</p> \n<p>For several years now the industry has been facing a talent shortage, especially in the field service department. In this article, we\u2019ll focus on field service and how OEMs are navigating the highly competitive nature of the job market and all the challenges that come with it.</p> \n<p>Despite sustainability concerns in the packaging world, OEMs are staying busy. Overall, the need for high-speed equipment is increasing. Along with this growth comes a growing demand for skilled field service technicians.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ll start by discussing the importance of qualified field service technicians for packaging equipment manufacturers. Then we\u2019ll go over the current challenges and strategies to attract and retain skilled field service talent in the industry.</p> \n<h2>The importance of skilled field service technicians in packaging equipment manufacturing</h2> \n<p>Naturally, the packaging equipment manufacturing sector depends on qualified and experienced workers. Field service technicians play a critical role. These technicians are frequently game-changers when it comes to customer satisfaction, reducing downtime, and optimising equipment performance.</p> \n<p>Of course, a strong field service technician needs technical expertise in troubleshooting, repairing, and maintaining the equipment. But, they also need a combination of soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, customer service and adaptability.</p> \n<p>Field service technicians are often the very face of the company, as they are the main point of contact for customers. To guarantee customer satisfaction, they must diagnose and fix the issue as fast as possible, all while communicating with the customers in a professional manner. This is crucial in order to maintain a trustworthy and lasting business relationship.</p> \n<p>The growing skills gap in the industry is undeniable. It can be explained by factors like an aging workforce and rapidly changing technology. The equipment is becoming more and more complex and efficient, thanks to increased automation, robotics and AI.</p> \n<p>As field service technology continues to advance, the skills required for service technicians are constantly changing. Now more than ever field service technicians need to be versatile and flexible. As a result, it\u2019s become more challenging to find qualified candidates who possess both technical expertise and interpersonal skills to succeed in field service.</p> \n<h2>Challenges in attracting and retaining skilled workers</h2> \n<p>The combination of the competitiveness of the job market and ongoing skills gap make it increasingly challenging for talent acquisition professionals to find reliable and qualified field service technicians.</p> \n<p>On top of that, according to PMMI, over 73% of companies do not have a real talent strategy. This lack of vision, combined with job hopping trends in qualified field service technicians create instability. Strong candidates are hunted down, and they often have opportunities coming in left and right. Motives like seeking better compensation, work-life balance, and career growth opportunities, make it tough for even the most reputable companies to recruit and retain talent. On top of that, it also increases costs for packaging equipment manufacturers.</p> \n<p>More and more, skilled technicians have a diversified background and don\u2019t necessarily work in a single industry which makes it tough for packaging OEMs to compete with companies in other industries. This intense competition may lead to higher salary expectations and a high turnover rate among technicians since it is more likely that they will job hop for better overall opportunities.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the costs associated with job hopping can be prohibitive for OEMs. Some costs associated with this are hiring and training new employees, loss incurred by decreased productivity as a result of the influx of such a large number of new workers, and ultimately, loss in customer satisfaction. It could go on to cause potential damage to the company\u2019s general reputation.</p> \n<h2>Strategies for attracting and retaining top talent</h2> \n<p>To attract and keep top field service talent, packaging OEMs have to adapt and come up with a new approach that successfully attracts and retains talent.</p> \n<p>Attracting capable candidates starts with creating a strong employer brand that focuses on field service excellence. Many candidates prioritise reputation when job hunting. The packaging industry is a small world and name image plays a big part in successful recruiting.</p> \n<p>To be competitive and attractive, companies showcase their\u00a0cutting-edge technology, innovative vision, and opportunities for growth. Obviously, competitive compensation and benefit packages \u2013 including travel allowances and per diem pay \u2013 are vital to stand out in the job market. Some companies are focusing their strategy on social media and professional networks as this is a highly effective way to target a younger generation of workers.</p> \n<p>The vice president of human resources Krista Combs and HR director Sara Secaur at PROMACH have demonstrated that marketing efforts can have a huge impact. Their communication strategy resulted in a 122% increase in the number of average applicants per month, within just 60 days of launching a new social media campaign (PMMI, 2023).</p> \n<p>Finding skilled field service technicians is one thing. Keeping them is quite another. Ambitious candidates look for training and development opportunities. They also look for teamwork and a positive company culture. Career advancement is also a major factor in joining a company. Providing a path from operator to technician to supervisor is something many candidates are after. Successful training programs and a strong company culture can help reduce turnover and thus maintain a stable workforce.</p> \n<p>Investing in training and development helps technicians stay current with the latest technologies, therefore making the company more attractive. Other ways companies can be attractive to field service technicians is by promoting in-the-field training programs, mentorship, certifications, and a human-centered management.</p> \n<p>On top of that, creating a team culture where technicians feel valued and empowered to contribute can boost job satisfaction and work productivity. Promoting growth and investing in the employees therefore plays a vital role in retaining the top talent. The investments in employees not only help retain the current talent but also attract ambitious candidates who are looking for long-term career movement.</p> \n<p>Field service is a one-of-a-kind role, requiring a diverse set of skills and personality traits. To remain attractive in the highly competitive job market, companies have to make employees a priority. They should make field service talent management a top goal. They should develop strategies to attract and retain top talent, which makes all the difference in the world when it comes to recruiting for packaging equipment manufacturers.</p> \n<p>To create a successful strategy, companies should include developing a strong employer brand, offering competitive compensation and benefits, using social media to target up-and-coming employees, promoting training and creating a supportive company culture.</p> \n<p>Another trend we\u2019re seeing in the industry is the expansion of contract-manufacturing. Outsourcing field service operations can help companies face these challenges and reduce costs in the face of candidate shortages and uncertainty in the economy. By collaborating with specialised service providers and utilizing a network of dependable contract technicians, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can tap into a more extensive talent pool and adjust the size of their field service teams as required.</p> \n<p>In the long run, the key to remaining competitive in the field service job market is to invest in people. By nurturing and retaining field service talent, packaging equipment manufacturers can establish a happy and motivated workforce which, in the end, results in happy customers and smooth sailing for all.</p> \n<p>About the author:Heloise Walters is business development manager at cooperative firm SOCAPS.</p> \n"}]}

With over 500 registered attendees from across 43 different countries attended, the summit showcased 18 speakers across 11 thought-provoking discussions and presentations. The speakers answered over 60 live questions from the audience.</p> \n<p>According to our third annual connected packaging\u00a0survey released earlier this year, the perceived value of data collection through connected packaging is rising, especially in the context of the imminent demise of third-party cookie data. We found sustained interest over the last 12 months with 82% of those surveyed stating they have used connected packaging, compared to over four-fifths (81%) from the survey released in 2023 and over half (54%) in 2022.</p> \n<p>Building on this research, during the summit I wanted to uncover new ways brands can tap into this evolving technology. There were lots of brilliant insights shared during the day and my key takeaways from the discussion include:</p> \n<h2>1. Overcoming barriers</h2> \n<p>Mohamed Bassyouny at\u00a0SIG, Stuart McLellan at Delga Press and Zakithi Mncwango at Nestl\u00e9 discussed sustainable innovations and digital solutions in connected packaging, and the benefits for manufacturers in terms of product control, accuracy, and consumer engagement.</p> \n<p>Connected packaging can enhance consumer interactions and trust, by supplying more detailed information and personalised experiences. Examples included innovative uses of QR codes for product information and engagement, such as Kellogg\u2019s use for accessible labelling and a cosmetics brand using invisible conductive ink for personalised tutorials.</p> \n<p>Challenges discussed included cost, resource allocation, and data privacy. The importance of starting with pilot projects and using labels for QR codes was suggested as a cost-effective approach. Technology\u2019s role in overcoming these hurdles, particularly with the aid of trusted partners, was highlighted.</p> \n<p>Looking ahead, AI and immersive technologies will offer more sophisticated interactions between consumers and brands. These innovations promise to further integrate virtual and physical experiences, enhancing consumer engagement and brand loyalty. Connected packaging has the potential to revolutionise the market through meaningful, consumer-centric solutions.</p> \n<h2>2. Packaging as a media channel</h2> \n<p>Katie Livesley at Dentsu UK and Gregor Murray at DCG assessed connected packaging\u2019s value as a new media channel. Control and value of consumer data was deemed the main benefit, which is often mediated by giants like Amazon. Winning brands will bypass these intermediaries to establish direct consumer connections.</p> \n<p>Successful examples include\u00a0Red Bull\u00a0and\u00a0Lego, who effectively use user-generated content and community engagement. The conversation also emphasised the importance of understanding and mapping the customer journey to make packaging relevant and valuable, highlighting the need for agility and collaboration across media channels.</p> \n<p>Challenges include cost, technological adoption, and changing consumer behaviour, requiring manufacturers to become more creative and agile. Experimentation, testing, and learning are vital for innovation. The key advice for brands was to innovate meaningfully and ensure that packaging innovations align with brand values and consumer relevance.</p> \n<h2>3. Data analytics & insights</h2> \n<p>Gemma Rollason at Peasy highlighted that the integration of AI technology enriches data collection, providing insights into consumer behaviour and material composition, helping brands optimise their operations. Consumer data reveals the importance of understanding behaviour patterns, product usage, and supply chain tracking. Brands can prioritise data based on their specific needs, offering a flexible approach to connected packaging.</p> \n<p>KFC in South Africa was a case study she shared that illustrates the benefits of such systems, showing significant behaviour changes and brand perception improvement through gamified rewards. It offers substantial potential for sustainability, customer engagement, and data-driven insights, encouraging brands to innovate and adopt these technologies for comprehensive benefits.</p> \n<p>Thomas Vollmuth, Koenig & Bauer highlighted that brands struggle with customisation, reaction times to ingredient changes, and waste from unused packaging. To address these challenges, he emphasised the importance of variable data printing (VDP) for connected packaging.</p> \n<p>VDP allows for unique codes on products, enabling direct consumer interaction, product authentication, loyalty programs and personalised marketing. This approach supports brand protection and compliance with regulations such as the European Digital Product Passport. Digital printing technology facilitates faster time-to-market, enhances consumer engagement, and contributes to sustainability by reducing waste. The digitalisation of packaging, combined with VDP, offers brands innovative ways to connect with consumers, differentiate their products, and meet future market demands.</p> \n<h2>4. Product protection & authentication</h2> \n<p>There are three main drivers for connected packaging: marketing, regulatory compliance, and anti-counterfeiting.</p> \n<p>Gavin Gerr at Laavaexplained that counterfeiting is a major problem, costing some economies more than they produce. Traditional authentication methods like QR codes can be easily spoofed. Laava uses digital fingerprints, invisible dots, and special logos to mark products. These are scanned by consumers, and suspicious activity triggers alerts. This protects consumers from potentially harmful fake products, and helps businesses maintain their brand integrity and profitability.</p> \n<p>In an example with Croc\u2019s shoe brand Hey Dude, Laava helped them not only with counterfeiting but also with identifying diverted products from authorised channels. Gavin explained that Laava can be set up to change the consumer experience, such as displaying a warning message, if a product is scanned too many times.</p> \n<p>When surveyed, 38% of the conference attendees stated that authentication is extremely important when making a purchase decision, and somewhat important to over half (52%).</p> \n<h2>5. Meaningful customer engagement</h2> \n<p>Consumers are interested in interactive features and educational experiences. Connected packaging can be used for good, such as educating consumers about sustainability or donating to charity.</p> \n<p>Acknowledging the complexities of sustainability-driven consumer choices and the evolving landscape of brand-consumer relationships, connected packaging can facilitate meaningful engagement, foster sustainability and drive positive change.</p> \n<p>Stefan Hills at Linked2Brands underscored how connected packaging transforms consumer engagement, turning static interactions into dynamic feedback loops. He emphasised the instant gratification and value exchange for both consumers and brands.</p> \n<p>Marco Macoratti at Linked2Brandspointed out that connected packaging isn\u2019t just about data capture but can also foster sustainability initiatives and social impact.</p> \n<p>This year\u2019s summit looked at the tried and tested benefits of connected packaging. From the benefits gleaned across data and insights, to education and customer loyalty. It is an essential tool across authentication, marketing and regulatory compliance. No longer a whim for brands to include on media plans, connected packaging is here to stay.</p> \n<p>About the author:Jenny Stanley is Managing Director at digital experiences studio\u00a0Appetite Creative.</p> \n<p>To watch the\u00a0Global Connected Packaging Summit summit click here.</p> \n"}]}

However, brands also have an opportunity to create memorable unboxing experiences that surprise and delight stressed consumers. In this article, we\u2019ll cover the key e-commerce packaging trends to watch, including rightsizing, paper-based solutions, reusable models, innovative materials, and designing for unboxing joy.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents1. Rightsized packaging2. The rise of paper3. Reusable packaging momentum4. Next-gen packaging materials5. Unboxing glimmers of joy</p> \n<h2>Rightsized packaging</h2> \n<p>With the average person in mature e-commerce markets receiving 64 parcels per year, and global shipments projected to hit 256 billion by 2027, the sheer volume of packaging waste is staggering. In some categories, up to 64% of the volume shipped is air due to oversized boxes. This not only wastes materials but also requires more space on delivery vehicles, increasing transport emissions.</p> \n<p>Rightsizing technology is critical to combat this issue. Solutions range from AI-powered systems that create custom-sized boxes for each order, to expandable cartons that adjust to snugly fit contents without void fill. By tailoring packaging to product dimensions, brands can reduce box sizes by up to 40%, slashing cardboard waste by over a quarter and eliminating up to 60% of void fill.</p> \n<p>The benefits extend beyond just material savings. Fitting more optimally sized packages on each truck significantly increases shipping efficiency and can cut transport emissions, which account for up to 70% of a package\u2019s carbon footprint, by a sizeable margin. For cost savings, space efficiency, and environmental impact, making shipping packaging as compact as possible should be every online retailer\u2019s first priority.</p> \n<h2>The rise of paper</h2> \n<p>As consumers and regulators alike demand an end to single-use plastics, paper-based packaging is emerging as the clear alternative. Globally, paper boasts a recycling rate of around 50%, far surpassing the mere 9% of plastic that gets recycled. Paper can also withstand more recycling loops, maintaining its integrity for up to 7 cycles compared to a maximum of 2 for plastic.</p> \n<p>To capitalize on paper\u2019s circularity advantages, brands should aim for mono-material packaging by using paper tapes, labels, and strappings. This makes the recycling process as simple as possible for end consumers. Even better, explore tree-free paper alternatives such as bamboo-based materials to push your eco-friendly credentials even further.</p> \n<p>While some plastic packaging may still be necessary for certain products and supply chains, making the switch to paper wherever possible is a highly visible way for e-commerce brands to broadcast their sustainability commitments and make a measurable difference.</p> \n<h2>Reusable packaging momentum</h2> \n<p>The mounting piles of single-use packaging waste generated by e-commerce\u2019s explosive growth have consumers worried, with 60% expressing concern over online shopping\u2019s environmental impact. 52% even say they would choose one e-retailer over another if it offered reduced packaging. Rather than hoping this sentiment goes away, savvy brands are getting ahead of the curve with reusable packaging.</p> \n<p>Reusable models, whether in-house or through third-party packaging-as-a-service providers, can drastically reduce packaging\u2019s environmental toll. Estimates show potential to cut CO2 emissions by up to 82% and overall packaging waste by up to 87% compared to single-use mailers. While there are certainly logistical and behavioral challenges to overcome, the benefits are too significant to ignore.</p> \n<p>Beyond sustainability wins, reusable packaging opens up new opportunities for customer engagement and brand storytelling. By involving consumers directly in packaging\u2019s ongoing lifecycle and expressing a sincere commitment to waste reduction, online retailers can forge deeper relationships and loyalty. As environmental concerns continue rising, proactive brands will secure an advantage by making reusable models an integral part of their e-commerce packaging mix.</p> \n<h2>Next-gen packaging materials</h2> \n<p>Science is uncovering new solutions to some of packaging\u2019s most stubborn sustainability sticking points. Innovative materials and coatings derived from natural sources are allowing brands to cut concerning chemicals and hard-to-recycle components without compromising on performance.</p> \n<p>Instead of traditional plastic-coatings or even PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d to shield packaging from liquids, grease, and abrasion, new paper coatings use green chemistry to impart hydrophobic and durability benefits while maintaining recyclability. Expect to see more packaging with these non-toxic, environmentally sound barrier protections in the coming years.</p> \n<p>The drive to develop viable plastic-free protective packaging is also yielding exciting breakthroughs. Foams made from upcycled waste streams like seafood shells and plant cellulose offer comparable cushioning to conventional materials like expanded polystyrene. The difference is that these sustainable alternatives break down harmlessly if they escape into the environment after use.</p> \n<p>As eco-aware consumers demand cleaner, greener packaging, brands that adopt and promote pioneering earth-friendly materials will have a compelling story to tell. The unboxing process becomes an opportunity to engage customers with powerful, authentic sustainability messaging that conventional packaging can\u2019t match.</p> \n<h2>Unboxing glimmers of joy</h2> \n<p>After years of pandemic upheavals and non-stop grim news, consumers are hungry for products that provide a respite from the stress with delightful little \u201cfeel appeal\u201d moments. While the days of excessive packaging are over, e-commerce boxes can still be designed to spark small bursts of much-needed joy.</p> \n<p>This doesn\u2019t have to mean expensive custom packaging or wasteful add-ins. Sometimes the most effective unboxing surprises are the simplest, like encountering an unexpected pop of cheerful color inside a box or package flap or following cleverly designed experiential reveals as the box opens. Tactile materials or even just a thoughtful, upbeat message can add an emotional dimension.</p> \n<p>The key is to view the unboxing sequence through the lens of creating micro moments of delight. Especially for brands without extensive marketing budgets, the package interior becomes valuable real estate for immersing the consumer in a mood-enhancing brand story. Making unboxing memorable is also a savvy way to encourage social media shares and build buzz.</p> \n<p>Of course, unboxing enhancements can\u2019t come at the cost of sustainability. The challenge is to engineer glimmers of joy into the packaging experience in a way that aligns with overall waste-reduction and efficiency goals. Uplifting moments are most satisfying when they feel genuine rather than gratuitous.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>As e-commerce growth surges toward 2026, online retailers have both an imperative and an opportunity to reimagine their packaging for a more sustainable, emotionally resonant future. By embracing rightsizing, paper-based alternatives, reusable models, material innovations, and joyful design, brands can demonstrate authentic environmental leadership while forging deeper connections with consumers.</p> \n"}]}

As brands navigate this dynamic landscape, five key trends emerge, offering a roadmap for creating packaging that not only protects and preserves products but also captivates and delights consumers. From embracing circularity through refillable solutions to experimenting with pastel palettes and audacious typography, these trends present an opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves while aligning with the values of an increasingly eco-conscious and emotionally attuned customer base. Join us as we explore the five packaging trends set to shape the industry in the year ahead.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents1. Refill revolution: Embracing circularity2. Saying goodbye to single-use plastics3. Soothing hues: The power of pastels4. Shape up: Bold geometric designs5. Personality-packed typography6. Final words</p> \n<h2>Refill revolution: Embracing circularity</h2> \n<p>The year 2024 will mark a significant shift away from single-use packaging as brands embrace the refill revolution. This movement, driven by a growing awareness of the environmental impact of packaging waste and the need to reduce carbon emissions, will see a surge in the adoption of reusable and refillable packaging solutions.</p> \n<p>Brands that successfully navigate this transition will be those that offer innovative refill options, such as keepsake packaging and subscription-based models. These approaches not only minimize waste but also foster a deeper sense of loyalty among customers who appreciate the convenience and eco-friendliness of refillable products.</p> \n<p>To effectively action this trend, brands should conduct a thorough assessment of their existing packaging and identify opportunities to introduce circularity. This may involve developing minimally packaged refills, implementing a packaging-as-a-service model, or exploring partnerships with third-party refill providers. By taking proactive steps to reduce single-use packaging, brands can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability while meeting the evolving expectations of environmentally conscious consumers.</p> \n<p>The refill revolution represents a powerful opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market. By embracing circularity and offering innovative refill solutions, brands can not only reduce their environmental footprint but also cultivate a loyal customer base that values sustainability and convenience in equal measure.</p> \n<h2>Saying goodbye to single-use plastics</h2> \n<p>As the world grapples with the environmental consequences of single-use plastics, the year 2024 will see a significant push towards plastic-free packaging solutions. With impending legislation from the UN and EU targeting single-use plastics, brands will be compelled to explore and adopt alternative materials that align with the growing demand for sustainable packaging.</p> \n<p>One promising avenue for brands is the use of paper-based packaging, which offers a more eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic options. However, brands should also consider innovative materials such as tree-free paper feedstocks, like hemp, and edible bio-based films. These cutting-edge solutions not only reduce the environmental impact of packaging but also showcase a brand\u2019s commitment to sustainability and innovation.</p> \n<p>Aluminum, with its high recycling rates and inherent durability, will also play a key role in the shift away from single-use plastics. By incorporating aluminum into their packaging designs, brands can add a touch of sustainable luxury while ensuring that their products are protected and preserved.</p> \n<p>To successfully navigate the transition away from single-use plastics, brands should carefully evaluate their existing packaging and identify opportunities to replace plastic components with eco-friendly alternatives. This may involve collaborating with packaging designers and suppliers to develop innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of each product while minimizing environmental impact. By proactively embracing plastic-free packaging, brands can position themselves as leaders in the sustainable packaging movement and build trust with increasingly environmentally conscious consumers.</p> \n<h2>Soothing hues: The power of pastels</h2> \n<p>In a world increasingly characterized by uncertainty and stress, the power of color in packaging design cannot be overstated. In 2024, brands will turn to soothing pastel hues to create a sense of calm and comfort for consumers seeking moments of respite and positivity.</p> \n<p>Warm, muted shades like soft apricot, gentle sage, and delicate lavender will dominate the packaging landscape, offering a visual balm for the senses. These colors evoke feelings of tranquility and nostalgia, providing a much-needed escape from the pressures of modern life.</p> \n<p>Brands can incorporate these calming pastels into their packaging through a variety of techniques, from solid color blocking to subtle gradient effects. Limited-edition or seasonal packaging presents an ideal opportunity to experiment with these fresh, soothing shades without compromising brand recognition or heritage.</p> \n<p>To effectively leverage the power of pastels, brands should consider pairing these soft hues with deeper, grounding neutrals like charcoal or navy. This contrast creates a sense of balance and sophistication, ensuring that the packaging feels both comforting and premium. By embracing the trend of soothing pastel colors, brands can create packaging that not only protects and preserves their products but also provides a moment of emotional connection and relief for consumers in an increasingly chaotic world.</p> \n<h2>Shape up: Bold geometric designs</h2> \n<p>In 2024, packaging design will witness a surge in the use of bold, geometric shapes that captivate the eye and create a lasting impression. These simple yet striking designs tap into the human brain\u2019s innate preference for clear, easily recognizable forms, making them a powerful tool for brand differentiation and recall.</p> \n<p>Research has shown that curved and simple shapes elicit positive emotions and associations, providing a subconscious shortcut for consumers navigating an increasingly crowded and complex marketplace. By incorporating these bold geometric elements into their packaging, brands can create a sense of familiarity and trust, even among new or potential customers.</p> \n<p>To successfully implement this trend, brands should look to their own unique stories and values for inspiration. A distinctive geometric motif can be derived from a brand\u2019s logo, its product offerings, or even its founding principles. The key is to identify a shape that embodies the essence of the brand and to execute it with confidence and consistency across all packaging elements.</p> \n<p>When designing with bold geometric shapes, brands should not be afraid to make a statement. Large, eye-catching forms that dominate the packaging landscape can create a powerful visual impact, ensuring that the brand stands out on crowded shelves or in digital marketplaces. By embracing the trend of bold geometric designs, brands can create packaging that not only protects their products but also serves as a distinctive and memorable ambassador for their brand identity.</p> \n<h2>Personality-packed typography</h2> \n<p>In 2024, packaging design will experience a dramatic shift as brands move away from the clean, minimalist typography that has dominated the landscape in recent years. Instead, a new era of bold, expressive, and personality-packed typography will emerge, reflecting a desire to forge deeper emotional connections with consumers.</p> \n<p>This trend, driven in large part by the preferences of Generation Z, will see brands embracing audacious and idiosyncratic type choices that infuse their packaging with a sense of energy, playfulness, and authenticity. From chunky, retro-inspired scripts to edgy, experimental sans-serifs, the typography of 2024 will be anything but bland.</p> \n<p>For brands seeking to capitalize on this trend, the key is to identify a typographic style that aligns with their unique personality and values. This may involve collaborating with skilled typography artists or designers to create custom letterforms that capture the essence of the brand in a distinctive and ownable way.</p> \n<p>When executing personality-packed typography on packaging, brands should not be afraid to push the boundaries of legibility and convention. Large, bold type that dominates the packaging canvas can create a powerful visual impact, while unexpected color combinations and playful arrangements can further enhance the sense of personality and charm. By embracing the trend of expressive, character-rich typography, brands can create packaging that not only stands out on the shelf but also forges a lasting emotional bond with consumers in an increasingly noisy and competitive marketplace.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>As the packaging industry evolves in 2024, brands that embrace these five key trends will be well-positioned to capture the hearts and minds of consumers. By prioritizing sustainability through refillable solutions and plastic-free alternatives, incorporating soothing pastel hues, leveraging bold geometric designs, and infusing personality through expressive typography, brands can create packaging that not only protects and preserves their products but also tells a compelling story. As the world continues to change, those who adapt and innovate will be the ones who thrive, forging deeper connections with their customers and leaving a lasting impact on the industry as a whole.</p> \n"}]}

The rise of interactive packaging: beyond traditional boundaries</h2> \n<p>Traditionally, packaging has been seen as a protective layer for products, serving the primary purpose of preserving the contents within. However, with the integration of smart technology, packaging is now breaking free from its conventional constraints.</p> \n<p>Interactive packaging goes beyond being a passive covering; it becomes an active participant in the consumer experience.</p> \n<p>Imagine a scenario where a simple scan of a product\u2019s packaging with a smartphone opens up a virtual world of information. From product details and usage instructions to promotional offers and sustainability initiatives, interactive packaging serves as a gateway to a wealth of information.</p> \n<p>This not only empowers consumers with knowledge but also provides brands with a direct channel to engage with their audience.</p> \n<p>For example, a food product\u2019s packaging could include a QR code that, when scanned, leads the consumer to a webpage featuring recipes, nutritional information, and even a community forum for sharing cooking tips.</p> \n<p>This level of interaction creates a memorable and personalised experience for the consumer, fostering brand loyalty.</p> \n<h2>2.

Enhancing sustainability through smart packaging innovations</h2> \n<p>The pursuit of sustainability is a driving force in today\u2019s packaging industry, and smart packaging is making noteworthy contributions to this cause.</p> \n<p>By integrating technology with eco-friendly materials, packaging professionals can create solutions that not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance the overall sustainability of the supply chain.</p> \n<p>One example is the development of smart packaging with embedded sensors that monitor product freshness. This can help minimise food waste by alerting consumers when a product is approaching its expiration date.</p> \n<p>By reducing instances of premature discarding, smart packaging aligns with the global push towards more sustainable consumption patterns.</p> \n<p>Additionally, smart packaging can play a role in improving recycling processes. Embedded RFID tags or QR codes can provide information on the materials used in the packaging, facilitating sorting and recycling efforts.</p> \n<p>This not only supports recycling initiatives but also helps consumers make informed choices about the products they purchase, based on the materials\u2019 recyclability.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the exploration of smart and interactive flexible packaging represents a significant leap forward in the packaging industry.</p> \n<p>As technology continues to advance, the potential for creating packaging solutions that are not only functional but also interactive, traceable, and sustainable is boundless.</p> \n<p>Embracing these innovations is not just about staying ahead in a competitive market; it\u2019s about reshaping the future of packaging for the better \u2013 a future where packaging is not merely a container but an intelligent, dynamic part of the overall consumer experience.</p> \n"}]}

By incorporating technology like QR codes or RFID tags, brands can provide consumers with detailed information about a product\u2019s environmental impact.</p> \n<p>This transparency allows eco-conscious consumers to make choices aligned with their values. Furthermore, traceability features enable quick identification of the product\u2019s origin, aiding in the tracking of supply chain practices.</p> \n<p>This is particularly significant in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals, where ensuring the authenticity and safety of products is paramount.</p> \n<h2>Challenges and considerations</h2> \n<p>While the potential benefits of connected packaging are immense, there are challenges to address. Privacy concerns, data security, and the environmental impact of electronic components are some of the key considerations.</p> \n<p>Striking a balance between technological innovation and responsible practices is crucial to ensure the widespread acceptance of connected packaging solutions.</p> \n<h2>Sustainability and traceability</h2> \n<p>Connected packaging also plays a crucial role in addressing the growing demand for sustainability and traceability.

Whether this is being driven by investor demand, banks monitoring ESG credentials or a genuine passion for the long-term future of our planet is perhaps by the by. What matters is that sustainability is quickly becoming a key consideration for all businesses.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just a must-have for banks or the board either, but a key consideration for consumers too. According to Deloitte\u2019s 2023\u00a0\u2018The Sustainable Consumer\u2019 report, consumers embraced more sustainable habits last year, than in the previous one. In terms of actions taken, 75% have recycled or composted household waste, 68% have reduced their food waste and 64% have limited their use of single use packaging.</p> \n<p>One in three consumers\u00a0have also stopped purchasing certain brands and products because of ethical or sustainability-related concerns. While there\u2019s no doubt the majority of brands are putting in the work when it comes to sustainable practices, they also need to think about how they can signpost this easily for consumers.</p> \n<p>Thinking about FMCG brands specifically, while they no doubt have their sustainability commitments and actions outlined on their websites, or in reports, how can they easily signpost their sustainability commitments to consumers doing their weekly shop?</p> \n<p>This is where packaging can make a real difference. Not only is packaging an essential part of a company\u2019s identity and branding, but used properly it can also be a strong indicator of a brand\u2019s values and sustainability commitments. Often packaging is the first experience consumers have with a product, therefore it is a key opportunity to showcase its sustainability credentials quickly and effectively.</p> \n<h2>What sustainable packaging says to consumers</h2> \n<p>Research by Boston Consulting Group shows that more than two out of three consumers have declared that environmentally friendly, recyclable packaging is important to them. Deloitte\u2019s research reflects similar sentiments, with more than half of those surveyed saying they consider a product which uses recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging to be more sustainable.</p> \n<p>According to research, the average\u00a0Brit spends 37 minutes\u00a0in the supermarket per visit. With such little time to make a purchasing decision, packaging plays a crucial role in driving consumer decisions, so FMCG brands looking to demonstrate their sustainability credentials need to make it as easy as possible.</p> \n<p>Research from Pro Carton, the European Association of Carton and Cartonboard manufacturers, shows that more than 80% of Brits are most confident about the recyclability of paper and corrugated cardboard. Therefore, brands that choose these materials are easily signposting the recyclability of their products.</p> \n<p>While it may sound straightforward, packaging that looks a bit \u201crustic\u201d and is easily identifiable as being made of paper materials, versus those replicating a plastic look or other plant-based solutions, works best to showcase the brand\u2019s relationship with sustainability. Therefore, materials such as corrugate and moulded fibre mean consumers can easily identify the material and know that it\u2019s recyclable, versus having to research a new sustainable material that they haven\u2019t come across before.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a wealth of examples of businesses taking this approach in recent years. In January Pringles changed its classic tube packaging for easier recycling for consumers. The metal at the bottom of the tube has also been replaced with recycled paper, and the plastic cap is also recyclable. According to the brand, the changed packaging will still keep the crisps fresh for 15 months.</p> \n<p>For food products especially, ditching plastic and adopting paper or moulded fibre packaging is extremely beneficial beyond brand positioning. Unlike plastic, moulded fibre or paper can absorb moisture, and keep food fresh for longer, whilst being completely recyclable and biodegradable \u2013 an extra win not only for consumers, but also stockists needing to consider the impact of sustainability on their supply chain.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of sustainable packaging beyond consumer perception</h2> \n<p>Although changing packaging can seem like a big commitment, the impact it can have on a business should not be understated. Not only could it attract new consumers who are looking for brands committed to sustainability, it can also go a long way to meeting various sustainability commitments and can become an integral element of a business\u2019 long-term sustainability strategy. \u00a0For example, businesses can include this in creating and meeting their SBTi (science-based targets), and also declare this sustainable shift in their wider CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) reporting.</p> \n<p>Once brands have committed to sustainable packaging, they can take this a step further by using that packaging to further educate consumers about recycling correctly, by printing clear instructions on how their packaging should be recycled. This reduces consumers\u2019 individual environmental impact, and in turn the business\u2019 Scope 3 impact, i.e. impact created beyond the business\u2019 internal supply chain \u2013 further supporting the business\u2019 efforts towards the\u00a0Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).</p> \n<p>Sustainable packaging doesn\u2019t just help attract new customers, it also allows FMCG brands to reap various financial benefits in the long run. Sustainable packaging can have a positive impact on transport and inventory costs, increased customer loyalty, removes the\u00a0Plastic Packaging Tax, and can help businesses gain support from the Government in the form of subsidies/tax credits.</p> \n<h2>How can businesses get there?</h2> \n<p>While changing packaging can seem daunting, the pros far outweigh the cons, and with the right partner the changeover process does not need to be lengthy or complicated. Cullen are Europe\u2019s only combined manufacturer of moulded fibre and corrugated packaging and as a leader in sustainable packaging, we support businesses of all sizes, across just about every sector in converting their current packaging into a more sustainable paper based alternative in just six weeks.</p> \n<p>In the last two years we have produced over 1 billion units of plastic free packaging for customers in 35 countries, whilst simultaneously educating businesses such as supermarkets and major retailers on how simple replacing single-use plastic with moulded fibre can be and the scale of the opportunity to adopt recyclable, compostable and biodegradable alternatives to plastic for a more sustainable future.</p> \n<p>The complete adoption of sustainable packaging is never going to happen overnight. But with the right partner and continuous education on the alternative packaging available, brands can make sure they have the tools and knowledge they need to make better and more informed choices.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>With packaging such an integral part of a brand\u2019s identity it should not be overlooked when considering your sustainability strategy. If you\u2019re embedding sustainable practices across your business, but your packaging doesn\u2019t reflect that it\u2019s letting you down.</p> \n<p>As plastic waste remains a major environmental challenge, and one of the things most consumers are committed to eradicating in order to reduce their environmental impact, using sustainable packaging is not only a strong step towards a greener future, but also to a whole new pool of consumers who are looking for sustainability-minded brands.</p> \n<p>About the author:David MacDonald is the CEO and owner of\u00a0Cullen, a provider of sustainable packaging solutions.</p> \n"}]}

From industrial machinery to office supplies and stationery, overpaying for products can have a lasting impact on a company\u2019s performance.</p> \n<p>This focus on value is particularly pertinent when it comes to corrugated packaging.</p> \n<p>See Also:</p> \n<p>While opting for the lowest unit cost may appear financially prudent on the surface, it could lead to unforeseen consequences that outweigh the initial savings.</p> \n<p>The inherent question is whether cheap packaging is genuinely cost-effective or if under-specifying packaging is a false economy. Regardless, it is crucial for businesses to strike the right balance in their packaging choices.</p> \n<h2>Look beyond packaging unit costs</h2> \n<p>The temptation to base decisions solely on headline figures often results in choosing what appears to be the most cost-effective option.</p> \n<p>However, a narrow focus on unit prices can overshadow hidden costs that may nullify any perceived gains or, worse, result in long-term financial losses.</p> \n<p>When scrutinising packaging costs, it becomes crucial to consider how these costs interact with other facets of business operations.</p> \n<p>Several real-world examples illustrating how cheap packaging choices can potentially backfire and offers insights on mitigating such impacts.</p> \n<h2>Minimising assembly times</h2> \n<p>One significant avenue for cost reduction involves minimising the time spent on packing and assembly.</p> \n<p>Specialised packaging solutions, such as crash lock boxes, not only accelerate the assembly process but also contribute to a reduction in secondary packaging costs.</p> \n<p>Despite the higher unit price of crash lock boxes, the overall cost, when factoring in labour savings, can be lower compared to standard taped boxes.</p> \n<p>In practical terms, let\u2019s consider a scenario where a standard taped box costs \u00a30.25 each, and five staff members, paid \u00a39.50 per hour, can assemble 50 boxes each in a given period.</p> \n<p>The total labour cost of \u00a347.50 allows for the assembly of 250 boxes. Contrastingly, a crash lock box, costing \u00a30.33 per unit (32% more expensive), with the elimination of the taping process, allows each staff member to assemble four times as many boxes.</p> \n<p>Despite the higher unit price, the overall cost for an assembled box is 16% lower at \u00a30.43 each, showcasing the potential savings through efficient packaging choices.</p> \n<h2>Custom size packaging</h2> \n<p>Customising packaging sizes emerges as another avenue for substantial savings. Standard \u201cstock\u201d boxes, often associated with cheap packaging, may not efficiently utilise space and result in higher shipping costs.</p> \n<p>By switching to custom-sized boxes, businesses can optimize space, potentially doubling the product capacity per pallet and realising a 25% overall cost reduction.</p> \n<p>Consider a scenario where sending 5,000 standard boxes at a unit cost of \u00a30.40 results in a total packaging cost of \u00a32,000. However, due to the larger size, only 50 boxes can be put on a single pallet, necessitating 100 pallets at a shipping cost of \u00a360 each. The total cost of packaging and shipping together works out at \u00a38,000.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, custom-sized boxes, optimizing space and accommodating twice as many products per pallet, with the same unit cost, require only 67 pallets.</p> \n<p>This reduction in pallets saves a third on shipping costs, resulting in an overall cost of \u00a36,000 and demonstrating a 25% cost saving.</p> \n<h2>Rationalisation of packaging</h2> \n<p>Another approach involves the rationalisation or simplification of the variety of box sizes used, leading to cost savings derived from economies of scale.</p> \n<p>The graphic below illustrates a packaging inventory of six lines, each with a unit cost of \u00a30.40 and a tooling charge of \u00a3250 per line.</p> \n<p>Assuming equal orders for all lines and a total packaging requirement of 30,000 units, the overall packaging cost stands at \u00a313,500.</p> \n<p>By rationalising the inventory to only two box sizes, reducing tooling costs by two-thirds, and ordering 15,000 units of each, the unit costs drop, resulting in an overall packaging spend of \u00a311,000 \u2013 an 18.5% saving over the six-line inventory.</p> \n<p>However, it\u2019s crucial to consider shipping costs, as rationalising lines can impact transit volume and, therefore, costs. Achieving a balance between simplifying inventory and optimising shipping volume is key to leveraging both tactics for cost-effectiveness.</p> \n<h2>Transit damage reduction</h2> \n<p>Arguably, the most impactful strategy for reducing packaging costs lies in minimising or eradicating transit damage. The figures, however, vary based on the volume of items shipped and the value of the products.</p> \n<p>For instance, in a scenario involving mid volumes and mid-value products (e.g. LED TVs) with a unit cost of \u00a31.00 for a standard box, sending 10,000 items results in a total packaging cost of \u00a310,000.</p> \n<p>However, if just 1% of these items (100 products) are damaged and returned, the costs skyrocket to \u00a350,000, excluding additional transportation and administrative costs.</p> \n<p>Investing in custom-engineered boxes designed to minimize damage, even with a unit cost 75% higher at \u00a31.75, can yield significant savings.</p> \n<p>If this can reduce the return rate by just half a percent, the cost of returned products drops by half too, providing a saving of approximately \u00a325,000.</p> \n<p>Despite the higher upfront packaging costs, the overall cost, when factoring in damaged products, sees a 29% saving \u2013 or \u00a342,500 vs \u00a360,000 (\u00a317,500 total saving).</p> \n<p>This figure doesn\u2019t account for additional transit and administrative costs, but more importantly, it fails to consider customer satisfaction and the potential loss of repeat business.</p> \n<p>Customers frequently receiving damaged products due to cheap packaging are less likely to reorder or recommend a company, impacting brand perception and customer loyalty.</p> \n"}]}

Read on for an overview of thechocolate packagingmarket, and discover the latest trends in chocolate packaging for the year ahead.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsChocolate packaging market: An overviewThe latest trends for chocolate packagingUnpacking delights</p> \n<h2>Chocolate packaging market: An overview</h2> \n<p>The United States is prominently recognized as the dominant force in the global confectionery market, with a projected revenue ofUSD 199 billionin 2024. Parallel to this, the global market for confectionery packaging is poised for substantial growth, with expectations to reachUSD 32.84 billion by 2030, up from USD 22.14 billion in 2022. This growth narrative extends to Europe, where the confectionery packaging market is forecasted to hitUSD 3.73 billionby 2029.</p> \n<p>Taking a closer look at the confectionery packaging market, the chocolate packaging segment emerges as one of its most prominent subsets. Demonstrating robust growth, it is forecasted to attain a global value ofUSD 2.186 billion by 2029. Within this category, chocolate bar packaging is particularly noteworthy. As the most prevalent type, it is projected to surpass a market value of overUSD 1.2 billion by 2034.</p> \n<h2>The latest trends for chocolate packaging</h2> \n<h3>Sustainable chocolate packaging</h3> \n<p>As consumers become increasingly health-conscious and actively seek healthier chocolate options, the same mindset influences the packaging selections for these confections. Aligning with their preference for a healthier lifestyle, there has been a significant shift towards eco-friendly and sustainable chocolate packaging in recent years.</p> \n<p>Such a trend is most noticeable from Google Ads keyword analysis, which shows that \u201ceco-friendly chocolate packaging,\u201d \u201csustainable chocolate packaging,\u201d and \u201ceco-friendly candy packaging\u201d are among the top three keywords that face intense competition, with competition indices reaching as high as 98 out of 100 and over 100+ regular monthly searches.</p> \n<p>Other industrial experts shared the same upbeat sentiment towards sustainable chocolate packaging trends. From comprehensive market research reports toinnovative, new packaging companies, sustainable packaging solutions are widely recognized as the chocolate packaging trend that is leading the chocolate packaging industry this year.</p> \n<p>Yet the good news is that even though traditional sustainable packaging materials like plain paper, Kraft paper, cardboard, and biodegradable plastics often have a less glossy, more natural appearance, they are not necessarily visually dull compared to non-sustainable packaging materials. For example, thisbiodegradable matte shipping bagwhich features a colorful, equally glossy design can be a great option for packing various chocolate and candies too.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, when complemented by creative and elegant designs,eco-friendly paper boxes for chocolatesmay also achieve a level of shine, luxury, and allure comparable to traditional packaging.Chocolate bar packaging crafted from Kraft paper, for instance, offers not only an authentically organic aesthetic but can also incorporate a tin tie seal, enhancing the product\u2019s convenience by enabling resealability for subsequent enjoyment.</p> \n<h3>Custom chocolate packaging</h3> \n<p>Custom boxes for chocolate are another emerging chocolate packaging trend according to Google Ads keyword analysis, which garnered a consistent monthly search volume of over 800 per month for the past 12 months. Meanwhile, this niche demonstrates a fiercely competitive landscape, with a maximum competition index of 100 out of 100.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, the keywords \u201cpersonalized chocolate box\u201d also command considerable popularity, achieving similar search volumes and a fully saturated competition index. This trend aligns with the insights of industry experts, as noted by informative sources such as aglobal luxury packaging magazineand adesign marketplace. These platforms highlight the current surge in personalized chocolate packaging, reflecting a growing chocolate industry emphasis on tailored consumer experiences.</p> \n<p>However, despite their similarities, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the subtle yet distinct differences between customized chocolate packaging and personalized chocolate packaging. Customized chocolate packaging typically caters to specific needs like size, shape, material, and branding, focusing on the structure and identity-building of chocolate brands. At the same time, personalized packaging goes even further in terms of individualization, it adds individual consumer touches like names or unique messages. Essentially, customization tailors packaging attributes and branding, while personalization places emphasis on individual consumer preferences.</p> \n<p>Wholesalers will be pleased to discover that a majority of packaging manufacturers are now offering a diverse range of custom chocolate packaging options. An excellent example of this is thebubble-protected gift bag for chocolate, which not only provides enhanced product safety but also allows for extensive customization, from the inclusion of a unique logo to packaging designs.</p> \n<p>Additionally, there is the option of afully customizable waterproof mailer, which is not just versatile in terms of aesthetic customization, but also offers choices in its material properties, such as varying thickness levels. Overall, these customization options in packaging solutions cater to a diverse set of needs, providing wholesalers with the flexibility to tailor packaging in line with their specific brand identity and product protection requirements.</p> \n<p>With respect to personalization, this refers to advanced options that delve deeper into tailoring specific aspects such as shapes, sizes, colors, and printing preferences. Such an elevated level of customization is increasingly feasible due to the widespread adoption of digital printing technology. Offerings like thischocolate gift boxand magnetic chocolate box packaging, accentuate such a trend. Moreover, these personalization options often also come with lower minimum order quantities (MOQ), as with thesemagnetic chocolate boxes, for example, available from as few as 200 units.</p> \n<h3>Visually striking chocolate packaging</h3> \n<p>This year, on a global level, there is clearly a unanimous consensus that colorful, vibrant, and even intense packaging is set to become a prominent trend in chocolate packaging. This agreement spans from theworld\u2019s leading manufacturer of high-end chocolateand cocoa products toinnovative packaging design firmsanddesign marketplaces.</p> \n<p>And there is substantial support for this with data from Google Ads highlighting that terms such as \u201cfancy,\u201d \u201cluxurious chocolate packaging,\u201d and \u201cgift-wrapped chocolates\u201d consistently rank among the top keywords, boasting competition indexes between 99 and 100. These keywords are aligned with this trend since they inherently imply a heightened demand for visually captivating packaging to ensure products stand out amidst the competition.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the concept of \u2018eye-catching\u2019 extends beyond mere visual design but encompasses a multitude of aspects. Take, for instance, the distinctive silhouette of a sail-shaped chocolate box, complete with blister trays. Such a novel configuration captivates the observer, providing a sense of rarity and sophistication through its unconventional form.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, a commitment to superior-quality materials also contributes significantly to the visual allure. The use of luxurious textures such as velvet, coupled with a glossy, luminous finish, on thisluxury chocolate box, for example, forges an image of elegance that transcends simple color schemes.</p> \n<p>To cap it all off, the image above demonstrates how a dynamic,rainbow-colored palette in chocolate packagingcan captivate attention and create a festive, jubilant atmosphere. Overall, the vivid packaging design shown above not only commands visual interest but also infuses the product with a sense of celebration.</p> \n<h2>Unpacking delights</h2> \n<p>The landscape of confectionery packaging, particularly the chocolate packaging market, is primed for dynamic growth, with studies forecasting an upward trend well into the 2030s. This growth represents not just a reflection of increasing chocolate consumption but also an indication of evolving consumer preferences and industry innovation.</p> \n<p>Key trends shaping this sector include a shift towards eco-friendly materials, coupled with an increasing demand for customization and personalization in packaging, as well as visually intense designs. However, it\u2019s significant to note that these elements are not concentrating only on aesthetics; they are reshaping the way consumers experience chocolate, turning each unpacking of packages into an invitation to an exhilarating journey of anticipation and delight, culminating in the joy of unboxing.</p> \n<p>Beyond the world of innovative packaging ideas and solutions listed here, remember to stay ahead in the industry by visitingAlibaba Readsfor more creative options, insights, and updates.</p> \n"}]}

Their development serves as a creative counterpart to Sorensen\u2019s functional design, further enhancing the aesthetic and promotional aspects of cups as well as broadening their customization options.</p> \n<p>Read on for an overview of the popularity of cup wraps, and discover essential insights to ensure you are making the most of cup wraps from a retail perspective in 2024!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAre cup wraps popular?Tips for cup wrap customizationEmbracing uniqueness</p> \n<h2>Are cup wraps popular?</h2> \n<p>The rising popularity of cup wraps is clearly reflected in the significant increase in keyword search volume. Google Ads keyword analysis reveals that searches for cup wraps have soared by over 80%, from an average monthly volume of 320 to 590 in the last quarter of 2023.</p> \n<p>Among the various printing methods and materials for cup wraps, Ultraviolet Dried Transfer Film (UV DTF) has emerged as the most popular printing mode for cup wraps according to Google Ads keyword analysis. The term: \u201cUV DTF cup wraps\u201d- which means cup wraps made of a particular type of transfer printing method, has seen an impressive average monthly search volume of 1600 over the past year. In terms of material, vinyl serves as the most sought-after type, with the keyword \u201cvinyl cup wrap\u201d having also achieved interest averaging around 70 searches per month as per Google Ads keywords.</p> \n<p>The significant rise in search volume not only reflects the escalating interest in cup wrap and its customization but also underscores the growing consumer and business fascination with innovative printing methods like UV DTF, emphasizing their importance in the market.</p> \n<h2>Tips for cup wrap customization</h2> \n<h3>Material selection</h3> \n<p>There are quite a number of materials available for cup wraps, with each material choice closely linked to the selected printing method. Paper, for example, is one of the most common materials well-suited for digital printing in view of its ability to produce vibrant, high-resolution designs. However, it is mostly used as basic, short-term cup wraps and often requires an additional adhesive or coating for application, unless it\u2019s specifically designed to stick directly to the cup.</p> \n<p>At the same time,heat transfer paperpresents a different approach. Specifically designed for transfer printing, which transfers printed designs onto surfaces through heat, this type of paper is perfect for cups made of materials that can endure heat application, such as certain plastics or metals. In this process, the print is effectively transferred from the paper to the cup under the application of heat and pressure.</p> \n<p>For more durable and long-lasting applications, film or vinyl materials are the preferred choice, especially when combined with transfer printing methods. Such synergy often brings out high-quality, resilient prints that are resistant to wear and tear, making them ideal for long-term use on various cup types, including plastic and metal.</p> \n<p>The growing global awareness of environmental issues in recent years has also led to heightened demand for eco-friendly options in cup wrap customization. Sustainable alternatives like biodegradable films are a prime example, offering quality without compromising environmental values. Additionally, acup wrap that utilizes eco-solvent inksin the printing process represents another environmentally-friendly option. These inks, produced from refined mineral oil extracts, align well with the preferences of eco-conscious consumers.</p> \n<h3>Printing methods for design optimization</h3> \n<p>Even though cup wraps may be produced via traditional printing methods like digital and screen printing, transfer printing is primarily the predominant choice for them in view of the well-rounded quality it offers for customizing cup wraps. This is evident considering that while digital printing is known for its high resolution, it often doesn\u2019t achieve the same vividness as transfer printing, though it is faster and hence may be more cost effective for small runs.</p> \n<p>Traditional screen printing, on the other hand, is often preferred for larger batch orders due to its durability and professional appearance. However, it is more for simpler designs, as the image quality might lack the detail found in transfer printing. In a nutshell,transfer printingis preferred for its ability to deliver outstanding image quality with sharp, lively shades and brightness. Furthermore, its compatibility with a wide range of materials, such as plastics and ceramics, allows for the creation of complex and high-quality designs on various surfaces.</p> \n<p>Yet among all the transfer printing modes, UV DTF printing stands out for its exceptional image quality and vibrancy in different colors, thanks to UV-curable inks that provide high-resolution, sharp images with vibrant colors. In contrast, cup wraps made of other transfer printing methods, including vinyl heat transfer, may still be able to offer good quality but often not at the same level of detail or color intensity ascup wraps made by UV DTF printing. Such quality enablesUV DTF-treated cup wrapsto look complex, and full with multi-colored designs.</p> \n<p>As a result, mostUV DTF cup wraps, such as the one featured in the picture below, also distinguish themselves in terms of durability, and are highly resistant to fading and scratches, while also usually waterproof, ensuring long-lasting visual appeal.</p> \n<p>Another notable advantage ofUV DTF cup wraps, particularly when compared to other heat transfer methods, lies in their ease of application. Unlike traditional heat transfer processes, UV DTF does not necessitate specialized heat press equipment. This is achievable via the adhesive on the UV-cured film, which facilitates direct application to the cup\u2019s surface by simply removing the protection layer. This simplifies the entire transferring process, making it accessible and straightforward for practically anyone.</p> \n<h3>Customization options and quality assurance</h3> \n<p>Aside from material and printing method options, wholesalers\u2019 customization potential largely depends on the flexibility offered by their chosen manufacturers. For instance, afull customization cup wrap providermight offer extensive customization options beyond standard choices like logos, packaging, and graphics, includinginstant online customization toolswithout or without templates, but accommodating a wider range of bespoke requests for a more tailored product experience.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, for wholesalers prioritizing basic design concepts or overall design outcomes, engaging witha provider that offers sample-based customizationcan be beneficial. Alternatively, partnering with a provider thatsupports both design-based and full customizationoptions, including customized sizes, and shapes or even providing free designs, may best meet their comprehensive requirements. Such a full wrap design-oriented customization may often include the ability to support the production of semi-permanent (easier to remove) or permanent full cup wraps to meet different business needs and consumer preferences.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, manufacturers adhere to stringent quality control protocols, emphasizing the unique quality aspects and requirements of each product. By consistently monitoring and evaluating print quality, they maintain high standards across all customization options. This is particularly true forproviders who prioritize quality control and quality assurance (QC & QA), even if it means getting limited customization options or designing according to given cup wrap templates only to ensure adherence to their rigorous standards.</p> \n<h2>Embracing uniqueness</h2> \n<p>The rising trend in cup wraps is evident from Google Ads keyword analysis, showing a consistent upward trend in monthly search volume over the past 12 months. Such a surge, particularly for terms associated with transfer printing technologies like UV DTF, highlights the growing interest in and demand for customized cup wraps.</p> \n<p>In terms of tips for customization, it is important for wholesalers to take note of the material and printing technology options available. Businesses can choose from various materials like paper, film, and vinyl, each suited to different printing methods for either semi-permanent or permanent customization. This versatility in design enhancement is complemented by minor or full customization options that emphasize quality assurance, since eventually, the key to successful customization lies in both functional and visually appealing product design.</p> \n<p>For more creative ideas, industry insights, and business updates on how to leverage the power of cup wrap customization, visitAlibaba Readsto discover a world of possibilities and to embrace uniqueness in product customization in the business arena.</p> \n"}]}

The recently strengthened Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) directive proposed by the European Commission (EC) stands as a prime example of these proactive efforts.</p> \n<p>Read on to find out what the latest and most important updates of the PPWR are, and discover its top three potential impacts on the packaging industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the latest PPWR updatesPotential impact of the latest PPWR regulationEntering the new packaging era</p> \n<h2>Overview of the latest PPWR updates</h2> \n<p>1994marked the birth of the PPWR in the European Union (EU), as a directive aimed to manage and reduce the environmental impact of packaging and waste throughout the EU. In November 2022, it underwent a significant revision to address the urgent need for harmonizing diverse regulatory practices across EU member states. This revision sought to promote circularity and eco-friendly packaging, focusing on the entire life cycle of packaging to reduce waste and enhance recyclability.</p> \n<p>The regulation continued to evolve throughout 2023and the European Parliament recently adopted its position on the PPWR in December 2023, a crucial step requiring collaboration between the European Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission before finalization and official adoption. The latest PPWR has seen significant revisions aimed at reducing packaging waste and bolstering safety measures, including setting ambitious targets for plastic packaging reduction (up to 20% by 2040) and general packaging waste.</p> \n<p>Integral to this latest revision are binding reuse goals and restrictions on specific single-use packaging formats, in order to encourage higher standards in collection, sorting, and recycling processes. Additionally, the field of food packaging faces more stringent scrutiny with the proposed ban on \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 like PFAs and Bisphenol A (BPA) in food packaging.</p> \n<p>On the front of recyclable and reusable packaging, new mandates and targets were also introduced, aiming for comprehensive coverage across all packaging materials and waste. This approach includes setting a 90% separate collection target for all packaging materials by 2029 and introducing secondary legislation that enforces strict recyclability criteria for all packaging.</p> \n<p>With its significant updates and more aggressive approaches, the latest PPWR has sparked discussions and debates within the packaging industry and among policymakers. These discussions highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by the move towards a more sustainable and circular economy in packaging.</p> \n<h2>Potential impact of the latest PPWR regulation</h2> \n<h3>Increase usage in alternatives for plastic packaging</h3> \n<p>With the latest PPWR regulation settingdrastic reduction targets for plastic packaging\u2014 aiming for a 10% reduction by 2030, 15% by 2035, and 20% by 2040 \u2014 it\u2019s evident that alternatives to plastic packaging will become increasingly important in the coming years to stay aligned with this regulation.</p> \n<p>The specific types of alternatives, naturally, largely depend on the most popular types of plastic packaging that need replacement. Plastic bags and bottles, for instance, are so prevalent in our daily lives that their staggering usage statistics accentuate the urgency for sustainable substitutes. In 2024, the world is projected to use a total of5 trillion plastic bags, equating to around 9.5 million bags every minute!</p> \n<p>These figures highlight the critical need for immediate action in replacing plastic bags with more environmentally friendly alternatives such asKraft paper bags, which are not only known for their robustness but also offer an appealing natural aesthetic. Additionally,wax paper bagsare highly valued for their water-resistant properties and efficacy in managing greasy or moist items, making them an ideal choice for a variety of food-related applications.</p> \n<p>In fact, the trend of using paper bags as an alternative to plastic bags has gained momentum in recent years, particularly in the upscale design and luxury retail sectors.Coated paper bagsoften featuring glossy or matte finishes, for example, have become a staple in high-end retail environments.Euro tote paper bags, as illustrated above, are another preferred choice for most of the luxurious and prestigious products. These bags typically come with elegant handles made of rope or ribbon and are crafted for a premium, sturdy image, serving as a sophisticated packaging solution for high-end brands.</p> \n<p>In addition to paper bags, other viable alternatives to plastic bags includecotton bags,canvas bags, andjute bags, encompassing both woven and nonwoven varieties. While these materials typically incur a higher initial cost, they offer long-term value due to their enhanced durability and design for prolonged use. Altogether, these eco-conscious options not only provide a sustainable solution but also cater to a range of applications.</p> \n<h3>Rigorous compliance in food packaging</h3> \n<p>The updates to the PPWR which specifically ban harmful substances such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances(PFAS) and Bisphenol A (BPA) from food contact packagingare aligned with existing concerns about food-grade packaging. In reality, PFAS, commonly known as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 due to their prolonged environmental persistence and resistance to natural degradation, have long been recognized as significantly harmful by most food-grade packaging companies.</p> \n<p>Simultaneously, BPA, notorious for its high likelihood of migrating from packaging into food and beverages, has been subject to comprehensive bans in specific applications, such as baby bottles, and has been completely prohibited in countries like France for all food packaging.</p> \n<p>The focus of the PPWR on eliminating these harmful substances from food-grade packaging, while expected, is still poised to significantly impact food safety. This Europe-wide ban reinforces the growing trend towardsBPA-free packaging for food, already prevalent in the market.</p> \n<p>Although essential for healthier practices, the transition towards BPA-free andPFAS-free packaging for foodmight lead to increased costs due to the use of natural materials like bamboo or sugarcane pulp, as illustrated in the picture below. However, as time progresses, the initially high costs of eco-friendly alternatives are likely to decrease due to increasing demand and advancements in production techniques that drive down expenses.</p> \n<p>This reduction in costs could make these sustainable options more widely accessible, potentially balancing out the initial increase in food packaging and delivery expenses.</p> \n<h3>Transformative changes in single-use packaging and packaging disposal</h3> \n<p>The latest PPWR proposal has set ambitious targets for single-use packaging reduction, alongside binding reuse goals. Such a proposal once again highlights the crucial role the PPWR plays in transitioning towards more sustainable packaging practices and imposing a great impact on packaging waste disposal.</p> \n<p>Emphasizing high-standard collection, sorting, and recycling processes, the proposed PPWR aims to achieve a 90% separate collection target for all packaging materials by 2029, less than 5 years from now. This essentially translates to stringent recyclability criteria across all forms of packaging, in order to ensure that every item is appropriately processed for reuse or recycling.</p> \n<p>In terms of single-use packaging, plastic bottles are a significant concern aside from plastic bags in view of their high usage rates. Multiple recent reports reveal thatover 1 million plastic bottles are consumed every minutearound the world, underscoring the critical need for more sustainable alternatives.\u00a0 Consequently, promoting the use ofrecycled bags,recyclable bottles, andbiodegradablematerials is vital to be in sync with the PPWR proposal\u2019s objectives.</p> \n<p>Overall, as illustrated by the images above and the ones that follow below, bottles made of 100% compostable,biodegradable bagsor anybiodegradable packagingserve as the alternatives that align with the reuse targets of the PPWR and also contribute to a broader effort in mitigating the impact of single-use packaging on our planet.</p> \n<h2>Entering the new packaging era</h2> \n<p>The PPWR\u2019s 2023 update marks a significant shift in packaging standards and practices, not only for European nations but also for anyone who\u2019s exporting goods with packaging into the EU zone. This latest revision establishes stringent targets for reducing plastic packaging, enforces stricter criteria for recyclable and reusablepackaging, and emphasizes the elimination of harmful chemicals in food packaging. Aiming for a 90% separate collection target for all materials by 2029, this update essentially is heralding a transformative era in packaging.</p> \n<p>This change in legislation is poised to heavily impact the packaging industry, propelling a move away from plastic packaging especially plastic bags, favoring alternatives like paper and cotton bags. The widespread adoption of BPA-free and PFAS-free food packaging, although potentially more costly, aligns with a more health-conscious approach. Additionally, the regulation encourages packaging waste reduction, especially those in single-use packaging, placing greater emphasis on recycling and reusing materials. Such a shift towards sustainability is indeed ushering in a whole new era for packaging which businesses and wholesalers must learn to adapt and embrace.</p> \n<p>For further insights into how these developments are reshaping the packaging industry, visitAlibaba Readsto stay informed with the latest ideas, industry trends, and business updates in this rapidly evolving field.</p> \n"}]}

A customized garment bag can enhance the brand\u2019s image, establish a strong emotional connection with customers, and convey the brand\u2019s message or story effectively.</p> \n<p>But customizing garment bags is more than sticking a brand\u2019s logo on the package and choosing nice colors that match it. Businesses can infuse creativity, functionality, and even instructional features into their packaging designs. Let\u2019s explore six innovative ideas that can make every garment bag a distinctive piece that shoppers can\u2019t resist!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsPrint the brand\u2019s historyPromote social media interactionsSuggest product pairingsInclude instructional diagramsIncorporate promotional themesAnswer FAQs and customer objectionsBoost customer engagement with practical garment packaging</p> \n<h2>Print the brand\u2019s history</h2> \n<p>When it comes to clothes, customers want to wear something with a great story behind it. Brands can turn theirgarment bagsinto a mini storybook by printing a visually appealing timeline of their history along the width or length of the bag. This kind of interactive storytelling allows customers to learn about the brand\u2019s significant milestones, the journey, and what sets them apart, all while unboxing their newly bought clothes.</p> \n<p>For example, a brand could useziplock plastic bagswith the timeline starting from the zip enclosure and moving downwards to the current year at the bottom edge of the bag. Important events or iconic products could be marked with distinct icons and brief descriptions. Businesses can make the unboxing experience even more mesmerizing by customizing aplastic boxwith collapsible sides where a brand\u2019s journey is portrayed.</p> \n<p>The inside of each side could depict the brand\u2019s timeline, critical events, or spotlight star products. As the customers open up the box, the sides fall flat to reveal this timeline or gallery, just like unraveling a surprise. Alternatively, brands that prefer a simpler design for their custom garment bags, can choose to print their logo at the top or bottom of the bag for a clear visual impact.</p> \n<p>Beneath the logo, aQR codecould be added. This code, when scanned by shoppers, could lead them to a website dedicated to detailing the brand\u2019s history. The webpage could include interactive features such as a timeline, videos, images, and more to engage the customer further.</p> \n<h2>Promote social media interactions</h2> \n<p>Sharing the brand\u2019s history on the garment bag is not the only way to create a deeper connection with the customer. In a Sprout Social survey,78% of consumersexpressed their desire for brands to usesocial mediato help people connect with each other.</p> \n<p>Social media provides a space for brands to interact with their customers directly. Customers can engage with the brand through comments, messages, reviews, and shares. One simple approach is for brands to use the space on their garment packaging to promote their social media handles.</p> \n<p>This strategy is genius in its simplicity and effectiveness. By printing their Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, or Snapchat names right on the garment bags, brands make it super easy for customers to find and follow them on social media.</p> \n<p>Besides social media handles, brands can motivate customers to share their purchases or experiences by using a specific hashtag. For example, they could encourage customers to post their own drawings, messages, or photos alongside their purchases. The incentive might include having the winning design featured on future packaging, fostering a sense of ownership and pride among customers.</p> \n<h2>Suggest product pairings</h2> \n<p>Custom garment bagscan transform from merely serving as a simple wrapping material to functioning as a powerful marketing tool for product promotion andupselling. By featuring images of coordinated items, ensembles, or accessories on the packaging, brands can subtly suggest other products from their line that pair well with the purchased garment.</p> \n<p>For example, a brand could opt forclear plastic garment bagsand include colored printed inserts showcasing different products from their line. For instance, an insert could show a pair of jeans that the customer bought, paired with printed images of a corresponding shirt, jacket, and boots that would complete the look.</p> \n<p>Another creative way is to usecolor-coded plastic garment bagsbased on the color palette of the season. For instance, when a customer purchases a mustard yellow top for fall, the bag could showcase silhouettes of other brand items in corresponding seasonal colors, like burgundy skinny jeans, brown ankle boots, and a plaid scarf.</p> \n<p>Brands seeking a high-tech customization option can use Augmented Reality (AR) codes on their garment bags for an immersive customer experience. For instance, a sportswear retailer selling running socks could print a small AR code on the plastic packaging bag. When customers scan the AR code, they can see a virtual try-on feature showing how these socks look with various athletic shoe options from the brand\u2019s collection.</p> \n<h2>Include instructional diagrams</h2> \n<p>Not only can a customized garment bag reinforcebrand identity, but it can also provide functional and educational value. Businesses can print clear and precise instructional diagrams on these bags to offer a practical guide for customers on how to use and care for the garment properly.</p> \n<p>For example, garment businesses can useSpot UVto print a series of diagrams onto aplastic tote bag, with each illustration showcasing a distinct method for tying a tie or draping a scarf. The glossy lines produced by Spot UV can emphasize the path that the tie or scarf needs to follow during each step, as well as highlight specific knots or loops.</p> \n<p>For apparel items such as t-shirts or tops, where sizing can differ from one country to another, brands can turn their garment bag into a visual guide. For instance, they may print a size conversion chart on aslider zip bagor incorporate measurement icons that cover specific dimensions (chest, waist, length).</p> \n<p>For delicate clothing like lingerie or silk scarves, brands can usehydrochromic inkon the packaging. This ink shows the washing instructions when the plastic bag gets wet. This allows customers to easily access the care guide by just moistening the garment bag when they\u2019re ready to wash their product.</p> \n<h2>Incorporate promotional themes</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s possible to turn simple packaging into a walking advertisement that increases brand visibility and incentivizes potential customers to purchase the product. With customized promotional garment bags, the promotion starts when customers place the item in their shopping cart.</p> \n<p>A simple promotional idea is to use ascratch-off panelon custom plastic garment bags. When customers scratch the scratch-off ink, they can reveal the discount or offer beneath. Consequently, shoppers will feel rewarded for their purchase.</p> \n<p>For instance, a luxury apparel brand could use clearpolythene garment coverswith a scratch-off section on the lower third of the cover. Inside could be exclusive offers like \u201c20% off on your next purchase.\u201d Customers will likely make a purchase, as people naturally love surprises.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, clothing brands can leverage seasonal sales by customizing their garment bags with themed discounts. By showcasing season-specific designs, brands can create excitement, appeal to the customer\u2019s sense of relevance, and prompt immediate action. For example, businesses can useblack frosted plastic bagsfor their Black Friday sales.</p> \n<p>The bags could be decked out with pixel art logos or minimalistic lines in silver or gold to make them look sleek and stylish. Similarly, for Halloween, brands could chooseLDPE bagswith Halloween-themed patterns or lens prints. These bags can carry catchy discount messages like \u201cBlack Friday Blowout: 40% off everything!\u201d or \u201cHalloween: 30% discount on your spooky attire!\u201d to further attract customers and boost sales.</p> \n<h2>Answer FAQs and customer objections</h2> \n<p>The final customization idea on the list is straightforward, yet it can eliminate any doubts or objections that may prevent a shopper from purchasing a piece of clothing. Businesses can enhance their garment bags by printing them with answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), consequently increasing the chances that customers make a purchase directly from the store shelf.</p> \n<p>For instance, a clear and concise summary of the return policy could be printed on the bag, detailing the process and deadlines for returning items. This approach can assuage customers\u2019 fears about the commitment to purchasing. For example, the bag could read, \u201cNot the right fit? No worries, we accept returns within 30 days of purchase.\u201d</p> \n<p>This customization idea can also address some of the customers\u2019 common queries about garments. For example, customers may wonder how long they can expect the clothes to last. To answer this, brands could print a phrase like, \u201cThis garment is designed to last approximately X years with proper care,\u201d accompanied by a bullet list of appropriate care instructions, such as using mild detergent and avoiding excessive sunlight when drying, among others.</p> \n<h2>Boost customer engagement with practical garment packaging</h2> \n<p>Customizing and branding garment packaging doesn\u2019t always necessitate intricate elements like elaborate patterns or advanced features such as RFID tags. Sometimes, brands just have to think outside the box and consider something as simple as printing the brand\u2019s history timeline on their garment bags or providing practical guidelines to facilitate customer interaction.</p> \n<p>Are you eager to take the plunge into the world of garment packaging in order to boost customer engagement?

Still, it\u2019s almost impossible to be fully cognizant of whether all items remain intact and in optimal condition, particularly if they are carried between multiple intermediaries and shipment carriers. What\u2019s more, external and environmental factors \u2013 which largely fall out of both suppliers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 hands \u2013 can diminish product quality and cause delivery delays.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, dented shipment packages, missed timescales, and goods in poor condition \u2013 or a hybrid of all of them \u2013 can\u00a0drastically affect\u00a0customer satisfaction and continued loyalty. Trust and reputation carry immense weight in global supply chains, and it\u2019s in suppliers\u2019 best interests to ensure that they can mitigate as many of the inherent transit risks as possible.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, in today\u2019s climate where transparent sustainability is more vital than ever, finding innovative ways to make product shipments more sustainable can \u2013 bilaterally \u2013\u00a0better protect perishable goods. Implementing sustainable packaging solutions tailored for different items can help prevent items from being damaged in the first place.</p> \n<h2>What causes perishable goods to suffer damage or deterioration?</h2> \n<p>Depending on the packaging that has been used in your shipping consignment, the fragility of the goods being shipped, and the environments through which they are being delivered, damage can occur at varying degrees.</p> \n<p>See Also:</p> \n<p>Of course, goods can be damaged for a multitude of reasons, with a combination of the following seemingly most likely:</p> \n<p>Transporting perishable goods via air or sea is usually very controlled, involving a mixture of refrigeration chambers,\u00a0dry dock surveys and maintenance, insulation processes, and others.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s in the whole planet\u2019s best interest to tackle this, as it contributes to global food waste amounting to\u00a08-10%\u00a0of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 3.3 billion tonnes</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that there are issues that suppliers cannot control, but if consignments regularly fail, it might be worth reassessing what needs improvement that falls within their remit. That often starts by looking at \u200cpackaging and finding a more sustainable alternative to prevent these issues from materialising.</p> \n<h2>Preventing temperature fluctuations and condensation</h2> \n<p>Maintaining consistent cool or frozen temperatures is crucial when transporting perishables. Allowing contents to heat up and cool down repeatedly encourages spoilage and condensation build-up which can ruin packaging integrity.</p> \n<p>Using high-quality\u00a0insulated or cold storage\u00a0containers tailored to shipment size will be a great way to start, rather than wrapping goods in thin materials that do little or nothing to prevent them from succumbing to the elements and varying temperatures. At a micro level, it would be worth investing in eco-insulated shipping boxes which can come in recyclable and degradable materials like cardboard. Placing cooling packs inside them can help to maintain low temperatures over an extended period, depending on \u200ctransit times.</p> \n<p>Sealing perishables in a waterproof impermeable film will also help perishable goods to withstand a broad range of temperatures. Suppliers can often source vapour-permeable and vapour-proof film for a variety of different substrates, all of which are environmentally friendly and recyclable.</p> \n<h2>Cushioning against shocks and vibrations</h2> \n<p>Accidents can happen during handling and transit, and while they\u2019re rare, they can have a profound effect on the quality and integrity of perishable goods.</p> \n<p>Goods processed en masse can suffer excessive vibrations or instant jolts which can cause storage containers or packaging to split, break, or fall from height. At this point, the goods could succumb to immense temperature spikes, or the force of a sudden impact could also spoil them before they\u2019ve even reached their destination. Even if routes have been\u00a0planned and optimised\u00a0strategically, taking preventative steps to minimise damage will provide greater long-term peace of mind.</p> \n<p>A proactive workaround would be to invest in bespoke moulded pulp products, which make great and\u00a0stable alternatives\u00a0to plastic. This protective eco-packaging can be moulded to any shape, meaning that each item is securely cushioned by a firm, protective \u2013 and recyclable \u2013 layer.</p> \n<p>Air cushions provide additional cushioning for goods in transit, with the inflated air demonstrating good compressive strength and flexibility. They can often be used to fill gaps between perishable goods in packages and can come in a range of shapes and sizes. Contrary to popular belief, they are usually made from recyclable or biodegradable materials like HDPE film, meaning they can be recycled and offer additional stability from excessive external pressure.</p> \n<h2>Minimising exposure to oxygen, moisture or light</h2> \n<p>Some perishables like meat and dairy products degrade quickly when exposed to direct light, excessive moisture and oxygen. If transporting these, it would be worth investing in specific protective products to prevent direct exposure.</p> \n<p>Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)\u00a0is a great way\u00a0to preserve food products and maintain a longer shelf life. This packaging uses a single or hybrid of gases to create protective environments for the food, which, when combined with suitable packaging materials and lowered temperatures, keeps food fresher for longer. This is often preferred to other methods like skin or vacuum packaging for certain products.</p> \n<p>Silica gel is another known desiccant and drying agent widely used in small packages to prevent moisture ingress. Some silica gel sachets work autonomously to absorb and remove humidity in sealed packages to prevent excessive condensation, dampness, or mould.</p> \n<h2>Degradable and recyclable materials</h2> \n<p>While durability is important in transit, sustainable factors like using renewable, recyclable and biodegradable materials cannot be overlooked. It just so happens that using renewable packaging materials can help reduce the impact of environmental damage or spoiling, thus increasing the chances of successful deliveries and keeping buyer relationships intact.</p> \n<p>Bagasse is a fibrous material made from sugarcane pulp, offering a\u00a0much more sustainable\u00a0option than conventional plastic and polystyrene. Sugarcane can be harvested far more quickly than trees, making it rapidly more renewable, while still being compostable and degradable. Over time, it becomes a nutrient-rich compost that can be put back into the earth.</p> \n<p>Bioplastics (such as Polylactic Acid) made from cornstarch or hemp can be used as more stable and reliable products usually made from soft or hard plastic. The material itself is biodegradable and carbon neutral, offering a more environmentally friendly option than plastics that rely on fossil fuels and excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Suppliers relying heavily on plastic should consider switching to this eco-friendly alternative imminently.</p> \n<p>The\u00a0ban on Russian birch\u00a0and birch plywood as packaging materials has prompted European producers to seek alternatives from sustainably managed forests and plantations (SMF&P). Poplar, predominantly situated in the Mediterranean, can be produced in large volumes and has an inherently faster growth cycle. Packaging materials made from standard timber can achieve a better carbon footprint and life cycle if using a certified product like poplar.</p> \n<p>With rising consumer expectations on sustainability, deploying green packaging materials tailored for individual perishable items offers new opportunities for eco-conscious brands to build customer loyalty while demonstrating environmental commitments.</p> \n<p>About the author: Annie Button is a freelance writer based in the UK.

Designers are empowered to create more distinct and creative packaging owing to the proliferation of smart devices that soak up all the once-mandatory information that previously stood in the way. They are truly benefiting from the power of a blank canvas.</p> \n<p>As a result, the race to establish and cultivate partnerships with producers that can manufacture packaging that is good for business, desired by the consumer, and good for the planet is one that very few can refuse to run.</p> \n<p>Did anyone ever doubt the importance of packaging in the digital realm or suggest it would become more paired back, bland or even a means to an end? When it comes to influencing customers\u2019 purchase decisions, packaging will always be in the mix.

This closer alignment with the customer\u2019s top priorities hasn\u2019t happened overnight, but one of the key takeaways from a learning curve that got very steep, very quickly, in recent years is that first or fast-mover advantage can be huge!</p> \n<p>Packaging remains a golden opportunity to exceed your customer\u2019s expectations. No longer is the product exclusive in consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions; instead, eco-credentials, interactivity, and personalisation are increasingly coming to the fore \u2013 and so much of this plays out in product packaging.</p> \n<p>As the bar continues to be nudged higher, innovation will be key, and opportunities to connect and collaborate with industry leaders, innovators, and suppliers will become more crucial. One event at the epicentre of all this progress is\u00a0Packaging Innovations & Empack, a chance to dive into dedicated networking sessions and exchange ideas and insights with movers and shakers in the e-commerce space.</p> \n<p>You only have to take a glimpse at a select few of the top brands attending:\u00a0Tesco,\u00a0Nestle, and\u00a0Amazon, to see just how highly the two-day flagship exhibition is regarded. It has fast become the bellwether for the following 12-18 months of packaging project innovation.</p> \n<h2>An industry rising to many challenges</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s e-commerce environment, where virtually any product can be sold online, throws up an incredible diversity of challenges and requirements. From easy and reliable processing and safe and secure transportation to sustainable logistics and delivering an outstanding consumer experience, the push and pull of who thinks what works best can quickly lead to bewilderment.</p> \n<p>The fact that e-commerce packaging has morphed from unpackaging a bland, regular box to successful brands looking to up their creative game tells you all you need to know. Who would have thought the battle to win and retain customers would occur inside cardboard boxes?</p> \n<p>Online retailers have quickly realised that they must understand what the customer cares about most to increase sales or maintain their current customers. It\u2019s imperative from the offset to consider all the elements that ensure customers feel valued and get what they want from their experience.</p> \n<p>Any significant consideration will likely lead brands to understand how critical it is to delight consumers with optimised e-commerce packaging. And when you consider that customers are not depending on you; rather, you are dependent on them, those who fail to listen by-and-large pay the price.</p> \n<p>The problem is that it is tricky to envision success when it comes to packaging. It is even tougher to articulate your vision beforehand in a boardroom. But the fear of being left behind has cemented its place on many a business agenda \u2013 as a discussion point, at least.</p> \n<h2>The digital realm</h2> \n<p>Among non-negotiables like protecting the product, enhancing a customer\u2019s experience demands increased attention. It is no longer just about the functional aspect of preserving the product throughout the e-commerce supply chain \u2013 it\u2019s about creating anticipation, excitement, and satisfaction as the product reaches the consumer. As a result, more and more emphasis is being placed on the unboxing experience.</p> \n<p>As digital screens and channels proliferate beyond recognition, most brands forget that their packaging is their most powerful media. Packaging that goes viral and gets shared</p> \n<p>It also helps create a distinct and easily recognisable identity, communicates the value of a product, provides important information and sets consumer expectations of a product.</p> \n<p>Analysts estimate that\u00a0social commerce could be a $11.1 trillion market by 2030, so meeting customers anytime, anywhere has quickly become a reality. You only have to look at TikTok\u2019s new e-commerce platform, TikTok Shop, and how it enables creators to sign on to sell products directly from the platform to witness first-hand the ratcheting up of pressure to nail the unboxing experience.</p> \n<p>Packaging\u2019s role has evolved so much that we\u2019ve even moved beyond unboxing. Videos of brands packing boxes have become a \u2018thing\u2019. Unboxing and boxing satisfy consumer curiosity and create the level of emotional connection that many brands chase.</p> \n<h2>Return of the pack</h2> \n<p>With the market for e-commerce goods changing drastically and growing faster than ever before, so too are the packaging methods and the customers\u2019 values. E-commerce websites have become a prevalent choice for purchasing goods due to their convenience, which includes direct-to-home delivery and easy product searching. The popularity of social media and user-generated content have made them powerful tools, providing a platform for discovery, customer engagement and brand building.</p> \n<p>However, alongside a rapidly growing e-commerce industry comes increased waste production and the logistical requirements for the millions of packages transported to customers regularly.</p> \n<p>As a result, packaging that easily integrates reverse logistics helps with retention, minimises shipping costs, eliminates complexity and streamlines operations, is highly sought after.</p> \n<p>The only constant is change. But understanding these changes is paramount. And that\u2019s where checking in on the progress of over 400 exhibitors at February\u2019s Packaging Innovations & Empack can prove invaluable.</p> \n<p>Packaging will always need to be crafted to leave a lasting impression on consumers, and there are so many new ways to alter people\u2019s perception of a brand and spark dialogue. That\u2019s why it\u2019s increasingly important to partner with a packaging supplier who can design tailored solutions that work in the supply chain and provide sustainable and fit-for-purpose packaging solutions.</p> \n<p>About the author:Naomi Stewart is marketing manager for Easyfairs.</p> \n"}]}

Lunar New Year, often dubbed thelargest annual human migration in the world, is no exception and serves as a key season for creative marketers and product designers alike.</p> \n<p>Read on to discover consumer trends during the Lunar New Year based on past statistics and explore some imaginativepackaging ideascentered around the season\u2019s popular products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsKey consumer trends during Lunar New YearCelebrate the Lunar New Year with creative packaging ideasProsperous innovative new wraps</p> \n<h2>Key consumer trends during Lunar New Year</h2> \n<p>Consumer buying trends throughout the Lunar New Year over the past few years appear to be largely similar across Asia, especially in East Asian nations like China and in countries with significant Chinese cultural influence such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia,where the Lunar New Year is most celebrated.</p> \n<p>Results of multiple studies revealed that the majority of the top seasonal purchases during the Lunar New Year are placed on food, with nuts and snacks topping various charts as the most emphasized food items. For example, a2021 Statista surveyindicated that 76% of consumers put nuts and snacks as their main shopping priority, and about half of them would splurge on wines and spirits during the Spring Festival in China.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a more recentresearch in 2023revealed a somewhat similar purchase preference during the Lunar New Year, with 69% of shoppers indicating their plans to include roasted seeds and nuts, 64% intend to buy snacks, whereas another 63% are expected to select a mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.</p> \n<p>In the Southeast Asian market,a studyshowed that despite variations in food purchasing preferences during the Lunar New Year period across different countries, snack items and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages consistently remain at the top of the list. On average, 50% of consumers in the region choose snacks, 44% opt for non-alcoholic drinks, and 36% select alcoholic beverages, making these the most commonly purchased items for Lunar New Year celebrations across the region.</p> \n<p>The fact that nuts, snacks, and beverages are among the most purchased items during the Lunar New Year highlights the importance of related packaging such as beverage bottles, paper boxes, paper bags, and plastic bags. Creative and attention-grabbing packaging for these products can almost certainly influence their popularity, presenting an opportunity for these popular products to stand out on shelves, appealing to customers looking for special treats or gifts during the season.</p> \n<h2>Celebrate the Lunar New Year with creative packaging ideas</h2> \n<h3>Beverage container packaging</h3> \n<p>Alcoholic or not, beverages are a top necessity for Lunar New Year as festival observers often host open houses for friends and family, making drinks a fundamental courtesy to offer all guests, yet it\u2019s noteworthy that amidst the flurry of innovation in product marketing, beverages for Lunar New Year celebrations can be far from dull.</p> \n<p>Indeed, they have the potential to be transformed into the center of attention or discussion-worthy highlights amidst the festive gatherings and chatter. For example, the bear-shaped juice bottle depicted below is surely eye-catching enough to capture the attention of young ones and those young at heart, evoking a sense of fun and fond memories.</p> \n<p>In fact, beyond the bear-shaped beverage bottle, the possibilities for packaging design are endless! Take, for example, agingerbread man-shaped or a dog-pattern container(sample in the following picture), which are both practical and charming with their friendly smiles and soft color schemes. Furthermore, these distinctive shapes offer room for customization, allowing visionary brands to stretch the boundaries of creativity in both style and utility.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the bottle design can also go a step further to contribute to both aesthetics and functionality. The \u201clayered\u201d design of thisuniquely shaped beverage bottle, for example, reminiscent of a staircase, is certainly captivating and not only adds visual interest that makes it stand out on the shelf but also allows for a more secure grip, making the bottle easier to hold. The contours provide natural hand placement points, enhancing the practical aspect of the design.</p> \n<h3>Paper box packaging</h3> \n<p>Creative packaging ideas can even turn ordinary, rather plain paper boxes into the elegant,luxurious-looking red Lunar New Year paper gift boxfeatured in the image above. This box is not only graced with golden Chinese calligraphy and landscapes but also versatile enough to present an array of premium gifts with its rigid, robust quality made of thick, durablegrayboardmaterial. Beyond wine or beverage bottles, it may also elegantly hold high-end tea sets, luxury confectioneries, or fine artisanal goods.</p> \n<p>The metallic handle is literally the striking centerpiece that manages to attract the most attention, while the golden ribbon opening in the middle offers a unique unveiling experience, emphasizing the box\u2019s dual function as both a sophisticated container and an integral part of the gifting ceremony.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, innovative approaches to paper boxes extend well beyond the shape but also in terms of their opening mechanisms. For example, as shown in the picture below, apaper box tailored for the Lunar New Yearcelebrations by reimagining the traditional packaging with its top-to-bottom opening. Adding more distinctiveness to this is its unique arch shape, which is reminiscent of traditional Chinese architecture, with a mix of vibrant red hues and gold accents to accentuate the festive spirit, making it a practical, ideal option for a standout gift presentation.</p> \n<p>Additionally, creative designs in paper boxes may feature adornments on the top surface, as exemplified by theLunar New Year gift boxmade of corrugated board in the picture below, which is adorned with an intricate pattern that mirrors the finesse of traditional Chinese weaving. Overall, the vibrant latticework against the rich red backdrop creates a stunning visual texture, while the centrally placed yellow hot stamp logo adds a touch of opulent branding.</p> \n<h3>Paper bag / plastic bag packaging</h3> \n<p>Special occasions and festive seasons command attention with their packaging, meriting designs that are as celebratory as the events themselves. The good news is that such essence can be captured even in items as commonplace as paper bags and plastic bags. For instance, this remarkabledrawstring candy pouchis infused with designs full of Lunar New Year elements. What\u2019s more, it is made of PLA non-woven fabric- an environmentally friendly, biodegradable material. Though technically a plastic, PLA offers a more sustainable option, with a texture akin to cloth or canvas.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as per the above illustration,paper drawstring bagsemerge as another creative packaging solution defying traditional expectations, offering the same convenience and closure functionality as their fabric counterparts but at a significantly lower cost\u2014potentially five times less expensive. This offsets the fact that while they may not offer the same long-term robustness as cloth bags, paper drawstring bags are an excellent eco-friendly option for lighter items, striking a balance between cost-efficiency and practical use.</p> \n<p>In addition, aside from design, shape, and closure style, innovative Chinese New Year packaging often also differentiates itself through unique sealing methods. For instance, theKraft paper bagset displayed below showcases two unique designs embodying the Lunar New Year spirit: a dynamic lantern and a firework theme. To enhance this festive feel, each bag can be securely and charmingly sealed using the included round sticker sheets. Each of these stickers is emblazoned with auspicious symbols and greetings, such as \u201cHappy New Year\u201d and traditional motifs that resonate with the Lunar New Year\u2019s celebration itself.</p> \n<p>Finally, the Lunar New Year packaging designs may even transform the otherwise standard rectangular or square profile of an opened paper bag into a lantern-like shape. For example, thisLunar New Year-themed paper gift bagis adorned with a creative ribbon closure. Its ribbon is threaded through two central holes and accompanied by robust hand strings, allowing for convenient transport. This design endows the bag with a distinct festive look, making it highly appropriate for the Lunar New Year season.</p> \n<h2>Prosperous innovative new wraps</h2> \n<p>The landscape of Lunar New Year consumer trends has consistently highlighted a preference for traditional festive treats such as nuts, snacks, and an assortment of beverages. With these items dominating the seasonal shopping lists, the importance of innovative packaging solutions that resonate with the festive spirit becomes apparent.</p> \n<p>By integrating creativity into the packaging of beverages and snacks, businesses can tap into the festive psyche, making their products not only a part of the celebration but a highlight. The innovative packaging ideas for beverage bottles, paper boxes, and bags, as well as plastic bags, are turning these mere containers to embody the spirit of the festival with prosperous, innovative new packaging.</p> \n<p>Discover how creative packaging ideas can elevate related offerings, and for additional insights about festive packaging, keep abreast withAlibaba Readsfor creative ideas, industry information, and the latest business updates.</p> \n"}]}

Rather than waiting for a perfect solution, an incremental approach that addresses specific consumer needs and challenges is recommended.</p> \n<h2>Navigating uncertainties with a granular approach</h2> \n<p>As the world grapples with uncertainties, sustainable packaging remains a key consideration for consumers. While not all consumers prioritise environmental factors equally, there is a growing segment willing to pay a premium for green packaging.</p> \n<p>For packaging players, the key to success lies in a detailed understanding of diverse consumer views and needs.</p> \n<p>Embracing sustainability incrementally, addressing pain points, and tailoring solutions to specific end-user segments will be essential in winning the race for sustainable packaging in the evolving market landscape.</p> \n"}]}

This figure significantly outstrips the UK, for which GlobalData identified the second highest number of deals, with 29 deals worth $60m, and Germany, with 15 deals worth $186m.</p> \n<p>The US was followed by the UK, Italy, Canada, Germany and India in number and value of M&A deals across 2023.</p> \n<h2>AI in packaging</h2> \n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a driving theme across industries, and\u00a0GlobalData expects the AI market to grow\u00a0from $81bn in 2022 to $909bn by 2030, with a 35% CAGR across the 2022-30 period. It reports that \u201cgenerative AI is likely to pose a threat to every business across every sector in the coming years.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Gopsill notes that the impact of the trend in packaging in 2023 was surprisingly minimal: \u201cAI-related hiring, patent publications, and filing discussions by packaging companies all decelerated between 2022 and 2023. This shows recent advances in generative AI have not translated to increased AI investments by packaging companies. This is because no new generative AI use cases have emerged that are yet suitable for broad adoption by packaging companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>He explains that this is because AI is not new to the packaging industry; instead it has been incrementally integrated into packaging business: \u201cThe key use cases of AI within the packaging sector \u2013 data analytics, predictive maintenance, computer vision, robotics, and facility management \u2013 have been around for some time, and AI-related hiring and patent publications in the packaging sector have grown over the last five years as these technologies have matured.\u201d</p> \n<p>The packaging industry then has seen relatively small disruption around AI but could be set to see change as the area evolves.</p> \n<h2>Hiring trends</h2> \n<p>Key developing areas have driven hiring trends across the packaging sector in 2023. In particular, these include\u00a0the supply chain, which maintained over 2,500 jobs in the US alone throughout the year. Geographically, the supply chain saw the biggest increase in hires in Germany, which jumped from 124 tracked roles in January 2023, to 316 in July.</p> \n<p>Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) has also led in hires, as the packaging industry continues to come under pressure to find solutions to the plastic problem. The US again dominated in hires across the sector, peaking at 5,855 active roles in ESG in June 2023, while Canada saw a notable decrease over the year. Starting the year with 425 ESG-related roles, the Canadian packaging sector had only 131 positions still active by November 2023.</p> \n<p>Digitalization also proved to be a noteworthy trend in packaging, with the UK consolidating its role as a leader, with 246 active roles in December 2023, significantly above Germany\u2019s 49 and Italy\u2019s 33.</p> \n<p>Across all areas, the US was the leading location of new jobs, followed by Germany and the UK.</p> \n<p>Having researched which companies were noteworthy within packaging hires, Gopsill comments: \u201cBall\u00a0Corp, Avery Dennison,\u00a0Ardagh Group,\u00a0Amcor\u00a0and International Paper were the leading hirers. Maintenance and repair workers were the most common occupation, followed by machinists, miscellaneous production workers, production, planning and expediting clerks, and laborers and material movers.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Share performance</h2> \n<p>Some companies have seen a significant percentage growth in share price over the last twelve months. These include the\u00a0Packaging Corporation of America, Berry Global and Ball Corporation, all of which are in the top twenty largest packaging companies globally.</p> \n<p>Also among the top twenty \u2013 and having seen noteworthy growth in share price since December 2022 \u2013 are Westrock (which announced its plan to merge with Smurfit Kappa in September in the biggest deal of the sector this year) and\u00a0Crown\u00a0Holdings, which recently acquired Helvetia Packaging, a beverage can and end manufacturing facility in Saarlouis, Germany.</p> \n<p>However, of the top twenty, several also saw a significant drop in share price in 2023. These include Amcor \u2013 which agreed to acquire Phoenix Flexibles in August \u2013 Ardagh,\u00a0Silgan,\u00a0UPM-Kymmene\u00a0and Stora Enso, which opened a new corrugated packaging production factory in the Netherlands in June.</p> \n"}]}

They are the ultimate means of securing goods during transit, protecting them from damages incurred from unnecessary movement, and keeping them in good condition until reaching their final destination.</p> \n<p>The best part is that retailers can choose protective packaging whenshipping products. This article will highlight five protective packaging trends sellers can glean in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the global protective packaging market5 protective and cushioning material trends to leverage in 2024In conclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global protective packaging market</h2> \n<p>Over the years, e-commerce has experienced exponential growth. As a result, the demand for product safety has also gone up. Experts predict theglobal protective materials marketwill increase from US $30.4 billion in 2022 to US $48.2 billion by 2032, growing at a 4.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>Here are some important market statistics businesses should know:</p> \n<h2>5 protective and cushioning material trends to leverage in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Bubble wrap</h3> \n<p>In the list of protective material trends,bubble wrapemerges as the most versatile. This protective packaging option traps air bubbles in flexible, transparent plastic sheets, allowing them to absorb shock from sudden moves or shifts.</p> \n<p>Businesses can usebubble wrapfor any product, regardless of shape and size. Not only does bubble wrap shield goods from harm, but it also secures them in place, preventing them from moving around during transit. And if goods should be stored at specific temperatures, bubble wrap also has thermal insulation properties.</p> \n<p>Good-qualitybubble wrapalso has excellent air retention, so it shouldn\u2019t pop too easily\u2014a sign of substandard quality. Although bubble wrap can protect all kinds of items, it is not the best option for heavy-weight goods.</p> \n<p>Bubble wrapis popular with many businesses and has been generating real hype. According to Google Ads, this packaging option has retained a healthy 301,000 search interest in 2023.</p> \n<h3>2. Styrofoam</h3> \n<p>Styrofoamis a lightweight, protective material that stabilizes products during transit. Manufacturers make them from polystyrene (EPS), and the chosen styrofoam must meet the regional standards where they make them for safe packaging.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all.Styrofoamis resilient and completely water-resistant, protecting goods sensitive to moisture from damage. This petroleum-based product is also extremely useful for protecting against bacterial growth.</p> \n<p>Styrofoamis relatively cheap and can be custom-molded to fit the seller\u2019s specific needs. As a bonus, styrofoam is recyclable, making it an environmentally friendly packaging option.</p> \n<p>Google data shows thatstyrofoamis also in high demand among businesses. It garnered an impressive and consistent 1.22 million monthly searches in 2023.</p> \n<h3>3. Foam-in-place</h3> \n<p>Foam-in-placeis a unique protective packaging trend. Manufacturers craft them from chemical mixtures that expand, encasing any item in a protective layer. This protective packaging is a trusted and effective option. It provides an impressive level of cushioning to protect its contents.</p> \n<p>Even better,foam-in-placesupports corners and edges, making them one of the most convenient protective packaging. However, businesses must place the foam-in-place evenly around the items to maximize its effectiveness.</p> \n<p>Foam-in-placehas different types of foam mixtures, each with its own packaging benefits:</p> \n<h3>4. Loose-fill materials</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers make loose-fill materials frombiodegradable plasticsor geofoam to fill spaces in shipping containers hosting lightweight, non-fragile items. Loose-fill materials (or peanuts) are abrasion-resistant and conform to the product\u2019s shape in transit.</p> \n<p>All businesses need to do is pourloose-fill materialsinto their package until it fills up, securing the item from damage and shifting. Loose-fill materials are not the best option for narrow and flat items that are more likely to move than a package.</p> \n<p>However, packaging electronics withpolystyrene peanutsis not a great idea. They can generate static electricity, which can easily damage such sensitive devices. Instead, they can use anti-static peanuts for such products.</p> \n<h3>5. Air pillows</h3> \n<p>Air pillowsare protective cushions that use air pressure to keep the items inside a package safe while forming an air barrier. Usually, products go through different climates during shipping, but the extreme ones can affect the air pillow\u2019s protection effectiveness.</p> \n<p>For instance, the air pressure in these products will decrease at low temperatures. But at extreme temperatures,air pillowsmay expand to dangerous levels, potentially damaging the item or the container.</p> \n<p>Regardless,air pillowsare great protective materials because of their weightlessness\u2014and they don\u2019t add to shipping costs. Air pillows are also hygienic, as they do not cling to wrapped packaging or create a mess when unboxing.</p> \n<h2>In conclusion</h2> \n<p>Businesses can ship their products without any form of protective packaging. The shipping process may involve a lot of bumps and unpleasant movements, meaning products have a high chance of arriving damaged, but protective packaging is the perfect solution.</p> \n<p>But since there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to protective packaging, businesses have to choose the best ones to secure their products. So, they can select bubble wrap, styrofoam, loose-fill materials, air pillows, and foam-in-place.</p> \n<p>These are the top protective and cushioning materials for packaging and shipping 2024.</p> \n"}]}

She is particularly interested in macro themes including ESG, regulation, and geopolitics. She is currently working with the consumer goods team on reports about emerging technologies.</p> \n<h3>Lara Virrey: What are the most exciting developments in AI for the packaging industry today?</h3> \n<p>Caroline Pinto:\u00a0Predictive maintenance is one of the most useful artificial intelligence (AI) use cases for the packaging sector. AI-powered predictive maintenance is used in manufacturing and distribution to reduce machine downtime. AI sensors continuously monitor the condition of machines and other equipment in factory lines and predict when maintenance is required.</p> \n<p>It can help reduce energy consumption and reduce costs of maintenance. For example,\u00a0Mondi\u00a0uses predictive maintenance tools across its paper manufacturing plants to save over $54,000 annually on repairs.</p> \n<p>Generative AI is the most recent technological advancement in the world of AI. Generative AI includes anything related to AI creating content in any shape or format, from writing original text, music, drawing, or painting. One of the most renowned examples of generative AI today is OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which can write original prose and chat with human fluency.</p> \n<p>In March 2023,\u00a0Avery Dennison, a provider of labelling and packaging materials and solutions, incorporated ChatGPT into its atma.io platform, a supply chain management platform. Traditionally, supply chain management requires significant time dedicated to repetitive tasks, such as email follow-ups.</p> \n<p>With the new update, when a client is alerted to an issue related to the supplier, they can select the email icon next to the issue alert, and ChatGPT generates a draft message to the supplier. The sender can then quickly send the email or customise it by changing the tone of the email. ChatGPT reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on other functions. In H2 2023, Avery Dennison will release additional generative AI capabilities to optimise customer service and personalise notifications.</p> \n<h3>Lara Virrey: How can companies in the packaging sector benefit from advances in generative AI in particular?</h3> \n<p>Caroline Pinto:\u00a0Generative AI is a relatively new AI technology, and adoption in the packaging industry has so far been limited. Generative AI can help simplify data analytics, speed up research and development, improve marketing and customer service experiences, and automate supply chain management.</p> \n<h3>Lara Virrey: Which barriers to the implementation of AI remain in the packaging industry, and how could they be overcome?</h3> \n<p>Caroline Pinto:\u00a0The barrier to implementation is on the industry and not necessarily on the technology. The packaging industry is slow to adopt new technologies, therefore, the first companies to adopt always pay significantly higher adoption costs.</p> \n<p>Having said that, companies that adopt AI early will benefit the most from increased efficiency and reduced costs. Companies most familiar with AI will be best placed to profit in the next five years.</p> \n<p>Regarding generative AI, there are cybersecurity and intellectual property protection concerns associated with generative AI tools that many companies are not addressing. The technology could transform packaging companies\u2019 operations, but a corporate strategy is necessary to mitigate potential risks.</p> \n<p>Additionally, building AI models is expensive and unnecessary in the packaging sector. Instead, companies must regulate the use of open-source models and invest in training natural language processing (NLP) models with company data when necessary.</p> \n<h3>Lara Virrey: What are the barriers to the implementation of the metaverse in the packaging industry?</h3> \n<p>Caroline Pinto:\u00a0The metaverse is a virtual world where users share experiences and interact in real-time within simulated scenarios. It is still largely conceptual but could transform how people work, shop, communicate, and consume content. The immaturity of the technologies central to the metaverse\u2019s success, a lack of clear use cases, and a growing concern about data privacy and personal safety have deflated the hype around the technology in 2023.</p> \n<p>Despite the metaverse concept feeling alien to many consumers and companies, it will add real value to the packaging sector. Many of the vital metaverse technologies are already being used or piloted by packaging companies.</p> \n<p>For example, packaging companies have brought together artificial intelligence (AI), AR, VR, cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to monitor and maintain key assets remotely. The sector could also use immersive metaverse solutions to optimise packaging design and quality control\u2014testing prototypes in a virtual world before bringing them to market. The sector can also use underlying blockchain and digital twin technologies to assist in creating more transparent and traceable supply chains.</p> \n<h3>Lara Virrey: Which companies are the leading adopters of AI technologies in the packaging sector?</h3> \n<p>Caroline Pinto:\u00a0 Avery Dennison, Berry Global and Tetra Laval</p> \n"}]}

That was the result of foil stamping.

This process includes applying metallic or pigmented foil to a substrate, like paper or cardstock, resulting in a captivating design and a glossy finish.</p> \n<p>This unique technique dates back to the 19th and 20th centuries and was popular for decorating book covers. Now,foil stampinghas become one of the most popular printing methods for packaging. Businesses love it because it helps create custom logos or text without additional costs.</p> \n<p>Unlike digital presses and conventional printing methods, foil stamping introduces a distinctive texture, providing printed items with an elegant touch that effortlessly grabs the consumer\u2019s attention.</p> \n<h2>How does it work?</h2> \n<p>Foil stampinginvolves using a metal die and pressure to print a catchy image on a surface. First, pressure is applied to the metal die, engraving the logo or design to be printed on its surface. Then, the next step stamps the image on the desired texture.</p> \n<p>Basically, businesses can use two types of foil stamping techniques to create amazing stamped images. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how these techniques work.</p> \n<h3>Hot foil stamping</h3> \n<p>Hot foil stampingis a type of embossing that uses a heated metal object to create a raised design on a surface. The heated object is placed on the item and pressed against it with a roller to stamp the desired design onto the surface. It\u2019s a simple way to add texture and detail to packaging.</p> \n<p>Although hot foil stamping works for most packaging materials, it produces better results on softer and more flexible ones (like leather, fabric, and vinyl).</p> \n<h3>Cold foil stamping</h3> \n<p>Cold foil stamping is similar to its hot counterpart but with one key difference\u2014it utilizes cold water instead of heat. This difference creates a different style, as cold water absorbs more ink than heat.</p> \n<p>This technique is common for crafting logos or patterns on clothing, packaging, and other materials. It usually involves rubber instead of ink stamps, creating a cleaner and less messy alternative.</p> \n<h2>What benefits make foil stamping worth it?</h2> \n<h3>Versatility and customizability</h3> \n<p>The best part aboutfoil stampingis its versatility. They can embellish various packaging types, including paper, plastic, glass, and metal. And retailers can choose from multiple colors and textures to create something special\u2014they can even collaborate with artisans to bring their unique ideas to life.</p> \n<p>Customizability is also a major benefit offoil stamping. It grants designers and product creators enough flexibility to add subtle yet distinct design elements, directing the customer\u2019s focus to the desired message. With foil stamping, nothing is out of reach.</p> \n<h3>Unique look and feel</h3> \n<p>Foil stampingoffers a unique aesthetic and tactile experience that businesses can\u2019t get with other printing methods. It instantly enhances the appearance of packing boxes, making them look more attractive.</p> \n<p>More importantly,foil stampinggives packaging an elegant feel, increasing its value and making it more appealing to consumers. It\u2019s a no-brainer for businesses into luxury products, as the technique helps create a sense of opulence around the delivered product or packaging.</p> \n<h3>Compatibility with other printing techniques</h3> \n<p>Businesses can easily pairfoil stampingwith embossing or debossing techniques. Using embossed foil stamping, retailers can create a 3D raised surface or image resist to attract the eyes.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, debossed foil stamping creates a receding effect, creating a sinking or indented look on the metallic design.Both techniquesare crucial for adding texture and eye-catching styles to product packaging with foil stamping.</p> \n<h3>Durability and longevity</h3> \n<p>Foil-stamped designs are resistant to the test of time. While traditional printing methods (laser or inkjet printing) fade over time,foil stampingproduces an effect that won\u2019t fade or scratch, meaning it\u2019ll maintain its original look for extended periods of time.</p> \n<p>Therefore,foil stampingis a fantastic option for businesses searching for long-lasting packaging solutions.</p> \n<h2>What are the different types of foil stamping?</h2> \n<h3>Metallic foil</h3> \n<p>If a luxurious look is what retailers want, then gleamingmetallic foilis their best bet. This foil type creates an attractive finish in shades of blue, green, silver, red, gold, and copper.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all.Metallic foilshave a unique property that offers different aesthetics depending on the angle consumers view them from. In other words, light adds a special depth effect that changes according to perspective.</p> \n<p>Whether sellers want large textured swirls or a classic matte look, the versatilemetallic foilwill make it stand out.</p> \n<h3>Holographic foil</h3> \n<p>Looking for something even more dazzling than metallic foil? Try holographic! Regarding creative and artsy packaging,holographic foiltakes the spotlight. It effortlessly turns images into vibrant 3D holograms, giving products an ultra-modern edge.</p> \n<p>But the real showstopper is the mesmerizing rainbow effect popular with anythingholographic. This foil\u2019s unique shine makes it perfect for retailers prioritizing packaging with a splash of color.</p> \n<h3>Pigment foil</h3> \n<p>Pigment foilopens the doors to a versatile spectrum of colors and finishes, ranging from the understated matte pigment to the lively glossy (non-metallic) ones. The best part is that each one offers a distinctive shade with rich depths.</p> \n<p>For instance, matte offers a subtle touch, while gloss delivers strikingly vibrant color combinations that shine from every angle.Pigment foilinglooks and feels amazing on various materials, from paper to plastic.</p> \n<h2>When should businesses use foil stamping?</h2> \n<p>Before retailers decide if they need foil stamping, they must determine if they want consumers to focus on something specific, like logos or icons. If they do, then foil stamping is the best way to make eye-catching designs and luxurious feels.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Foil stamping can also emphasize specific keywords or phrases within the packaging design. However, avoid making the prints too distracting.</p> \n<p>For foil stamping, businesses should use a simple color palette and subtle metallic backgrounds. That way, the packaging will look modern and stylish without obstructing the message the retailer wants to communicate.</p> \n<p>However, if sellers want maximum impact, they can experiment with multiple foils. It\u2019s an excellent way to blend various textures and colors beautifully.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Foil stamping offers various advantages that make it a fantastic choice for any product packaging. Its effects are stylish and long-lasting, making it the perfect solution for businesses\u2019 creative needs.</p> \n<p>So, if businesses need ways to stand out from the competition or want to highlight something specific about their products, foil stamping is the way to go. So don\u2019t hesitate! Start making those attractive packaging and get consumers talking in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

What innovative solutions are emerging from this eco-conscious shift?</p> \n<p>Dive in as we unravel the eco-friendly packaging solutions that are not only shaping\u00a0ecommerce order fulfillment\u00a0but also redefining the very essence of sustainable commerce.</p> \n<h2>#1: Water-Soluble Packaging</h2> \n<p>Water-soluble packaging\u00a0is an innovative solution that dissolves when it meets water. It\u2019s crafted from a unique blend of polymers sourced from plants and marine materials. The creation process turns these natural polymers into a film, which is then shaped to cater to a variety of packaging requirements, ensuring no remnants are left behind.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s why water-soluble packaging matters:</p> \n<p>In the sustainable packaging world,\u00a0Notpla\u00a0emerges as a leader. As a result of collaboration between skilled designers and chemists, Notpla has introduced a cardboard takeaway box that\u2019s both biodegradable and resistant to water and grease. This groundbreaking product offers a much-needed alternative to the single-use plastic containers that have burdened our environment for so long.</p> \n<h2>#2: Edible Packaging</h2> \n<p>As e-commerce and retail sectors search for sustainable solutions to waste woes, edible packaging serves up a treat that\u2019s as tasty as it is Earth-friendly. This innovation is a testament to the evolving art of\u00a0packaging design for retail, where the packaging doesn\u2019t just serve a functional purpose but also enhances the overall consumer experience</p> \n<p>Made from food-friendly materials like rice, potatoes, seaweed, and even chocolate, these ingredients are transformed into films, holders, and layers. The outcome? Packaging that not only protects but also tempts consumers to devour the whole package.</p> \n<p>Yet,\u00a0edible packaging\u00a0has its hurdles. Its organic makeup means it doesn\u2019t last long, requiring careful storage and distribution strategies. And while it\u2019s tasty, it must also protect against dirt, dampness, and air \u2014 a delicate balance to strike.</p> \n<p>The most notable benefits of this packaging are:</p> \n<p>KFC once trialed an edible coffee cup, hinting at this packaging\u2019s potential. Though it didn\u2019t become a staple, it painted a picture of a world where food and wrap merge.</p> \n<p>Notpla\u2019s Ooho, an edible alternative to plastic water bottles, further pushes the envelope, hinting at a future where sustainability and innovation go hand in hand.</p> \n<h2>#3: Plantable Packaging</h2> \n<p>Imagine a packaging material sprinkled with seeds. Instead of tossing it, you plant it. With some care, water, and patience, what was once a piece of packaging becomes a vibrant plant, flower, or even a tree. It\u2019s a transformative approach that redefines the destiny of discarded packaging, turning it into a living wonder.</p> \n<p>The charm of plantable packaging lies in:</p> \n<p>So, how does this transformation from a package to a plant occur? The science is beautifully simple. Packaging materials, typically crafted from biodegradable elements like recycled paper, cradle seeds within. These seeds stay dormant until they touch soil and water. Once in the ground, the packaging decomposes, setting the stage for the seeds to sprout and flourish.</p> \n<p>Pangea Organics Bar Soap is a standout in this space. Beyond crafting organic soap, they redefined the entire product journey. Using recycled newspaper and water, they fashioned durable, eco-friendly fiber boxes.</p> \n<p>But the real enchantment is the tree seeds nestled inside. After using the soap, customers can plant the box and watch it transform into a tree.</p> \n<h2>#4: Reusable Packaging Systems</h2> \n<p>Moving away from the conventional \u201cmake, use, dispose\u201d model, these systems advocate for a \u201cmake, use, return, and reuse\u201d cycle. After delivering its contents, the packaging isn\u2019t thrown away. It\u2019s crafted to be sent back to its origin, refurbished, and then repurposed for another delivery.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s why reusable packaging systems make sense:</p> \n<p>Leading the charge in the realm of reusable packaging is Repack. Their approach is both smart and sustainable. They supply packaging tailored for easy returns. After a customer unpacks their order, the packaging can be neatly folded into a mailer. This slimmed-down version is then returned to Repack, prepped, and primed for its next journey.</p> \n<h2>#5: Biodegradable Films</h2> \n<p>Biodegradable films are crafted to naturally decompose, offering a stark contrast to regular plastics that can haunt our environment for hundreds of years. These films gracefully break down into water, carbon dioxide, and organic matter, ensuring a minimal ecological footprint.</p> \n<p>Derived from organic sources like starch, cellulose, or proteins, the creation of these films involves harnessing these natural polymers, refining them, and then molding them into pliable films.</p> \n<p>Cutting-edge research and technology have further allowed the infusion of specific additives to bolster the film\u2019s attributes without hindering its biodegradability.</p> \n<p>The biggest benefits are:</p> \n<p>Biodegradable films\u2019 adaptability has spurred their adoption across multiple sectors. The food industry, for instance, wraps perishables in these films, mitigating food wastage.</p> \n<p>In healthcare, they encase certain medicines, ensuring a green aftermath. The beauty and personal care realms are also jumping on the bandwagon, aligning their packaging with the surging consumer appetite for eco-friendly alternatives.</p> \n<p>A shining example of biodegradable films\u2019 potential is Mi Zhou\u2019s Soapack. This ingeniously designed soap bottle, made from biodegradable film, is crafted to melt away in hot water once emptied.</p> \n<p>Soapack\u2019s genius lies in its dual role: it\u2019s a container that actively combats the environmental strain typically linked to personal care containers. By addressing the waste from such products, Soapack paints a picture of a future where utility and sustainability merge effortlessly.</p> \n<h2>Charting a greener path in e-commerce fulfillment</h2> \n<p>Innovations like biodegradable films, reusable packaging systems, and plantable packaging aren\u2019t just fleeting novelties; they\u2019re heralding a transformative phase in e-commerce, where green is the new gold standard.</p> \n<p>With the global community confronting the environmental fallout of rapid growth, e-commerce stands at a pivotal juncture, poised to make a difference.</p> \n<p>Yet, the path to a wholly green e-commerce packaging realm remains under construction. Embracing these sustainable practices often demands more than just a change in perspective \u2014 it calls for substantial financial investments.\u00a0Ecommerce funding\u00a0plays a pivotal role in this context, acting as the driving force behind this green transition.</p> \n<p>With the right financial support, e-commerce ventures can channel funds into the research, development, and rollout of these green packaging alternatives.</p> \n<p>The responsibility rests on the shoulders of industry frontrunners, production giants, and even everyday consumers to advocate and embrace sustainable avenues.</p> \n<p>At this juncture, we\u2019re compelled to reflect: Is the e-commerce sector rising sufficiently to meet its consumers\u2019 eco-aspirations? What further innovations can we spearhead to minimize our environmental impact? And crucially, can e-commerce emerge as a paragon of packaging sustainability, setting a benchmark for other sectors?</p> \n<p>About the author:Alex Selwitz is the Director of SEO for Red Stag Fulfillment, an eCommerce fulfillment warehouse.</p> \n"}]}

Read on to find out how to choose the right cosmetics jar for you.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket size for cosmetics packagingFactors to consider when choosing a cosmetics jarThe impact of packaging on user experienceConclusion</p> \n<h2>Market size for cosmetics packaging</h2> \n<p>The worldwidecosmetic packagingmarket was worth US $51.60 billion in 2022, is expected to increase to US $53.37 billion in 2023, and could reach US $70.94 billion by 2030, according toFortune Business Insights. Cosmetics sales are rapidly increasing in developing countries, partly thanks to people\u2019s disposable income growing alongside the influence and awareness of societal beauty standards via social media, etc.</p> \n<p>Asia Pacific dominated the cosmetics jars market in 2022, followed by China, accounting for over three-fifths of the total. As more people become interested in self-care and maintenance, there is a broad scope for the cosmetics industry to grow.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when choosing a cosmetics jar</h2> \n<h3>Materials</h3> \n<p>It goes without saying that the type of cosmetics you wish to package will likely determine which type of jar or container is right for the job. Once you know that, there are a number of other important questions to ask during the selection process:</p> \n<p>Some cosmetics, such as essential oils, are sensitive to light and may break down with increased exposure. Therefore, you must first check whether the cosmetic needs shielding from sunlight to stay fresh.</p> \n<p>Some creams, like those with fruit extracts, may have high acidic properties. This can cause corrosion inside metal containers.Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)orglass jarsare the best options for such cosmetics.</p> \n<p>Some creams require flexible, squeezable containers. This will most likely be determined by how the cream should be applied.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important to therefore make an informed choice when choosing a jar or a container according to the different creams retailers intend to supply.</p> \n<h3>Sizes</h3> \n<p>Again, the size of the cosmetics jar \u2013largerorsmaller\u2013 will only be determined once the product\u2019s final quantity is finalized. The suitable size may also be determined by whether the product has a longer or shorter shelf life, with smaller containers being preferable so that the cream doesn\u2019t expire or spoil before it is finished.</p> \n<p>Ordering jars in large quantities can save costs. Balance this with anticipated demand to prevent excess inventory. Industry standards or local laws may also regulate jar size. Some products may have specific size requirements to ensure customer safety and accurate labeling.</p> \n<h3>Color options</h3> \n<p>Aesthetics are crucial when packaging products as they are likely to influence whether a customer is drawn to them or not.

Colors can also be selected according to fashion trends and seasonal changes. However, before settling, it\u2019s advisable to dissect what different colors might signify across different cultures, etc.</p> \n<h3>Printing options</h3> \n<p>A cream\u2019s label should stand out. Thus, investing inpremium labelshelps to set a product apart from competitors. When selecting labels and printing type, consider how the product will be handled and where it will be stored. It pays to choose a printing service that guarantees quality and versatility.</p> \n<p>BOPPis a good material for custom cosmetics labels thanks to its flexibility and resistance to oil and water. It can handle constant touching, squeezing, and contact with oil or water. BOPP also offers a lot of freedom when it comes to design, giving brands the chance to play around with their designs.</p> \n<h3>Seals and closures</h3> \n<p>Above all else, a cosmetic container\u2019s closure and seal mechanism should be user-friendly.Pumps, flip-top lids, andscrew capsare preferable depending on the viscosity and texture of the cream within. Jars should be air-tight to prevent contamination and leakage. Likewise, opt for jars with induction or tamper-evident seals to assure customers of the cream\u2019s quality and safety.</p> \n<p>User-friendly closures minimize the likelihood of contamination during product use. Jars that are easily resealable better protect their contents from exposure to bacteria, air, and other contaminants.</p> \n<h2>The impact of packaging on user experience</h2> \n<p>The presentation of a cream plays a vital role in attracting prospects and influencing their purchase decisions. The right packaging can make all the difference in terms of capturing the essence of a brand and creating a lasting impression on consumers.</p> \n<p>Here are some reasons why wholesalers should opt for user-friendly cream jars:</p> \n<h3>Ease of use</h3> \n<p>Cream containers that are easy to open boost user satisfaction and encourage repeated use. User-friendly cosmetic jars often have lids that can be closed securely to avoid accidental spills or leakage.</p> \n<p>Transparent or clear jars also allow the user to identify the contents of a jar without opening it. This is useful when organizing and selecting products on the go.</p> \n<h3>Eco-friendly materials</h3> \n<p>People are increasingly aware of the detrimental affect packaging can have on the environment, pushing them to seek out companies that use Earth-friendly packaging. Research materials that are easy to recycle, break down naturally, or can be composted.</p> \n<p>Eco-friendly cream jars are made from materials like glass, aluminum, or recyclable plastics. Some businesses have even done away with outer boxes to reduce the need for additional waste materials.</p> \n<h3>Prioritize portability and storage</h3> \n<p>Think about how easy it is to store and carry the containers you\u2019re looking to source. Jars that can be stacked and stored easily will be preferred by both the stores selling your product and the customers using it. Jars in cylindrical or square shapes tend to be more portable and offer improved stacking, sitting together snugly and minimizing waste.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The choice of jars for packing creams isn\u2019t merely a matter of aesthetics. Instead, it can create a huge difference in terms of efficiency and user experience. Wholesalers who invest in functional and well-thought-out containers can gain a competitive edge by fulfilling prospects\u2019 needs.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re looking for cutting-edge cosmetics packaging products, browse thousands of options onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

It encompasses the packaging used to transport goods in quantities like drums, pallets and containers. While its main purpose is to safeguard products during shipping and storage it also contributes significantly to logistics, branding and sustainability.</p> \n<p>The global industrial packaging market is poised for growth in the upcoming years due to several factors. These include a rising demand for packaged goods, increasing trade activities and a growing focus on environmental concerns.</p> \n<p>According to projections the global packaging market is anticipated to reach USD 151.37bn by 2035 through a CAGR of 7.3%, from 2023 onwards. This presents an opportunity for investors and businesses aiming to tap into this profitable market segment.</p> \n<h2>Types of industrial packaging</h2> \n<p>Industrial packaging encompasses a range of options each, with its distinctive qualities and advantages. When it comes to packaging there are various types of containers and materials to choose from. Here are a few examples worth considering.</p> \n<p>Heat Shrink Wrap</p> \n<p>Heat shrink wrap is a type of plastic film that contracts in size when exposed to heat. It is commonly utilised in packaging to provide a secure and snug seal around items safeguarding them from any potential harm during transportation and storage. PVC shrink wrap tubing can reduce its size by up to 40%.</p> \n<p>The heat shrinking process involves enveloping the product with the film and then applying heat using either a heat gun or an oven. As the film becomes heated it tightly conforms to the products shape creating a barrier against moisture, dust and other impurities. One of the advantages of heat shrink wrap lies in its versatility as it can be utilised for packaging various products such, as food items, electronics and machinery.</p> \n<p>Stretch Wrap</p> \n<p>Stretch wrap, also referred to as stretch film is a flexible plastic film that finds common application in wrapping and securing items for transportation or storage.

Although they may appear similar there are differences between the two approaches. Boxing entails placing a product inside a cardboard box and securing it with tape or adhesive. This technique is often used for lighter items like electronics or clothing.</p> \n<p>Crating involves constructing a wooden frame around the product and fastening it with nails or screws. This method is typically employed for heavier items such, as machinery or furniture.</p> \n<p>Drums and Bulk Bins</p> \n<p>Drums and bulk bins are commonly utilised in industrial packaging to transport and store a wide range of products. Drums are cylindrical containers, typically made of steel, plastic or fiber take on a shape and are commonly employed for the transportation of liquids or powders. Bulk bins serve as large containers specifically designed to transport and store dry goods like grains, seeds or pet food. Both drums and bulk bins play a role in safeguarding the contents during transit and storage to ensure that the products reach their destination intact and, without any damage.</p> \n<p>In industrial packaging drums and bulk bins find applications in the transportation of chemicals. The primary concern during chemical transportation is to prevent any leakage or spillage. Drums serve as a choice for chemical transport due to their durability and ability to withstand the challenges of transportation. Conversely bulk bins are specifically designed for transporting chemicals like fertilizers or pesticides allowing for convenient storage, in large quantities and dispensing as required.</p> \n<h2>Materials used in industrial packaging</h2> \n<p>Industrial packaging can be crafted using a range of materials each possessing its distinct characteristics and advantages. Plastic is a choice due to its durability and versatility. It can be molded into shapes and sizes making it suitable for products of different forms and dimensions.</p> \n<p>Metal packaging is renowned for its robustness and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. This makes it an excellent option for transporting goods over distances or storing them in challenging environments. Paper packaging is also commonly utilised, in the\u00a0food industry. It is lightweight, environmentally friendly and easily recyclable.</p> \n<p>While every type of material has its advantages it\u2019s important to also consider the potential drawbacks. For instance, plastic packaging is not biodegradable and can contribute to environmental pollution. It\u2019s been estimated that a staggering 8.3bn tonnes of plastic have been produced far resulting in around 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste that either ends up in landfills or finds its way into the natural environment.</p> \n<p>On the one hand metal packaging can be quite heavy and costly to produce while paper packaging may not be as resilient as some alternative options. However, despite these downsides each material serves a purpose in the packaging market and finds extensive use, across various industries.</p> \n<h2>Market trends and opportunities</h2> \n<p>In the industrial packaging market there is a noticeable trend towards embracing\u00a0sustainable and eco-friendly solutions. A significant number of companies have already begun adopting environmentally friendly practices by utilising recycled materials and products with lower emissions.</p> \n<p>This shift can be attributed to the growing awareness and concerns surrounding the environmental effects associated with conventional packaging materials like plastic and metal. Consequently, there is now an increased demand, for packaging alternatives that\u2019re biodegradable and compostable.</p> \n<p>Besides sustainability, technological advancements have also had an impact on the industrial packaging sector. For instance, the adoption of automation in packaging operations has enhanced efficiency while reducing expenses.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the integration of technology like sensors and RFID tags has greatly improved supply chain management and product tracking.\u00a0Manufacturers and distributors who incorporate RFID technology\u00a0into their supply chains witness an 80% enhancement, in shipping and picking accuracy.</p> \n<h2>Sustainability in industrial packaging</h2> \n<p>Industrial packaging plays a crucial role in safeguarding products during transit and storage but it also affects the environment. With consumers growing more conscious of the consequences of their purchases it\u2019s crucial for companies to take measures to minimise their carbon footprint.</p> \n<p>One approach to achieve this is by embracing friendly practices, in industrial packaging. Companies can opt for materials minimise packaging waste and design packaging that is easily recyclable. This not only helps to reduce their environmental impact but also appeals to consumers who prioritise sustainable products.</p> \n<h2>Challenges in industrial packaging</h2> \n<p>One of the hurdles in industrial packaging is the issue of cost. As businesses aim to reduce expenses and enhance efficiency they frequently search for methods to decrease their packaging expenditures. However, this approach can potentially jeopardise the protection of products. Raise the likelihood of damage, during transportation and storage.</p> \n<p>Designing packaging that fulfills both aesthetic needs poses another challenge. On one hand the package must be durable and offer protection. On the other hand, it should also be visually attractive and represent the brand effectively. Achieving this balance can prove to be a time consuming task.</p> \n<p>Regulations also pose a challenge in the field of industrial packaging. Each country has its set of regulations pertaining to packaging materials labeling obligations and environmental impact. Companies must navigate these regulations to ensure compliance while also striving to achieve their business objectives.</p> \n<h2>Future of industrial packaging</h2> \n<p>It is evident that technology will continue to have a significant impact on shaping the future of industrial packaging. We can anticipate advancements such as packaging that can monitor product conditions during transportation and the utilisation of 3D printing for personalised packaging solutions. The possibilities are truly limitless.</p> \n<p>Another aspect we can expect to witness in the coming years is a focus on sustainability. With consumers prioritising environmental consciousness companies will need to adapt their packaging practices accordingly. This may involve incorporating materials or implementing recycling programs aimed at reducing waste.</p> \n"}]}

It is also the first interaction many customers have with a business, so it pays to create a positive first impression.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsIntroductionElements of business card customizationConclusion</p> \n<h2>Introduction</h2> \n<p>Despite our increasing reliance on digital tools, business cards remain vital to face-to-face interactions, providing a tangible and memorable connection between a business and potential customers and partners. They also reflect the company they represent, underscoring the importance of them needing to make the right impression.</p> \n<p>According to Business Research Insights, the business card\u2019s global market size was US $17 million in 2021 and is estimated to reach 43.33 million in 2031, exhibiting aCAGR of 9.5%during the forecast period. In a thriving market, it\u2019s only natural then that the need for quality business card customization continues to grow.</p> \n<h3>Importance of business card customization</h3> \n<p>Business card customization is more than just a design choice; it is a strategic investment in a brand\u2019s identity. As a small business or retailer, you can stand out in a full marketplace by tailoring your business card to reflect your unique personality and the essence of your business.</p> \n<p>Customization allows you to infuse your brand identity into every aspect of your card, from design and content to paper quality and special features.

For example, when customizing a business card, one needs to consider their industry and create a business card best suited to it.</p> \n<p>This is just one of the many elements that each business card should have to stand out. Others include:</p> \n<h3>Design</h3> \n<p>A business card\u2019s design is the first thing people notice. A business card\u2019s design should be visually appealing and aligned with the brand\u2019s overall outlook. Moreover, color is a powerful communicator of emotions and associations, so it should align with the message one wants to convey. For instance, red and orange can evoke energy and excitement, while blue and green exude calmness and trust. Careful color selection sets the tone for the business.</p> \n<p>Font is also important in that it needs to be easy to read as well as align with the brand\u2019s personality and values. For instance, a formal, elegant font might suit a high-end boutique, while a modern, sans-serif font could be more fitting for a tech startup. Furthermore, consistency in font selection across brand materials enhances recognition.</p> \n<p>Finally, use graphics that complement your brand. Icons, symbols, orillustrationscan enhance your card\u2019s design but they should be relevant and not clutter the card. A clean and professional design can leave a lasting impression. Also, be sure to add your company logo as this is the visual cornerstone of the brand.</p> \n<h3>Content</h3> \n<p>While business cards should create a good impression, their primary purpose is to actually provide contact information. A business card\u2019s content should be concise and informative and include essential information like your name, job title, and contact and business details. Ensure the font and text size are readable.</p> \n<p>When customizing business cards, consider adding optional information that amplifies your brand\u2019s presence. Social media handles, website URLs, and a tagline can all contribute to a more engaging card. However, don\u2019t overwhelm the card with information.</p> \n<h3>Paper and printing options</h3> \n<p>The choice of paper stock and printing method can significantly impact a business card\u2019s overall feel and quality. High-quality paper and printing techniques likeembossingor foil stamping can make a card stand out.</p> \n<p>The type of paper and printing used should align with the business brand identity. As sustainability gains popularity, consider usingeco-friendlypaper and printing options. These will not only lower your carbon footprint but also appeal to environmentally conscious clients.</p> \n<h3>Size and shape considerations</h3> \n<p>Business cards come in many shapes and sizes. While the standard size of 3.5 by 2 inches is widely accepted, practical, and fits easily in wallets, custom sizes can make a card more memorable. Choose the size that aligns with your brand\u2019s identity while also factoring in the information you need to include.</p> \n<p>Die-cut cardswith unique shapes are also particularly eye-catching. However, ensure not to compromise practicality or readability. For instance, a baker may want to consider designing a card shaped like a cupcake.</p> \n<p>However, balancing creativity and practicality is important. A card should be unique but not so unconventional that it is difficult to store.</p> \n<h3>Texture and feel</h3> \n<p>The tangible experience of receiving abusiness cardcan leave an imprint. Therefore, it pays for businesses to experiment with different textured options like matte, glossy, orpaperand consider how they complement their business design and branding.</p> \n<p>The texture of the paper and the special finishes should correspond with a brand\u2019s identity and the emotions you want it to evoke. For instance, a tech startup may want to choose a smooth, glossy texture, while a spa can use a luxurious textured feel.</p> \n<h3>Imagery</h3> \n<p>Incorporating imagery in a card can help tell a brand\u2019s story. Personal images can add a human touch, while product images can be suitable for retailers who want to showcase their products.</p> \n<p>Consider using high-quality images that reflect the business\u2019 products, services, or industry, but ensure the imagery complements the overall design.</p> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>Business card customization doesn\u2019t have to break the bank but it pays to first set out a budget before diving in. Before doing so, you\u2019ll also want to factor in your customers\u2019 tastes, preferences, and budget constraints, as this may have a say on whether you should hold back or go premium.</p> \n<p>For instance, some businesses may prefermetal business cards, which need engraving and embossing but are more durable, while others prefer standard paper-based cards.</p> \n<p>If you are a small business looking to customize your business cards, set a cost-effective budget that does not compromise the quality of your business cards.</p> \n<h3>Special features</h3> \n<p>Consider adding special features likedie-cut shapes, embossing, and QR codes when customizing business cards.</p> \n<p>With digital business cards gaining popularity, more people are addingQR codesto their conventional business cards. Some businesses may also add personalized messages and handwritten notes to add a personal touch to their card. This is mostly impactful when connecting with potential clients and partners.</p> \n<p>Overall, special features should be designed to make a business card more memorable and interactive and prompt further engagement with a brand.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In the fast-paced world of business, first impressions matter, and business cards remain a powerful tool for making a lasting impression on prospective clients and partners.</p> \n<p>Business card customization is key to ensuring a card reflects a brand\u2019s identity and values, making it a memorable and effective networking tool.</p> \n<p>As a small business and retailer, it\u2019s crucial to carefully consider your cards\u2019 design, content, paper, size, texture, budget, and special features to create a tangible representation of your brand that speaks to your professionalism and dedication to your craft.</p> \n<p>For all your business card needs, including paper, printers, and other accessories, visitAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

Younger consumers and those living in urban areas showed a higher preference for considering the environmental impact of products before buying them.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, for the majority of consumers, economic uncertainty, especially regarding high prices for necessities, takes precedence over environmental concerns.</p> \n<h2>Hygiene, food safety, and shelf-life top packaging priorities</h2> \n<p>When it comes to product packaging, US consumers value hygiene, food safety, and shelf life as the most important characteristics.</p> \n<p>The uncertainties brought on by recent disruptions have heightened consumers\u2019 focus on these aspects. In particular, shelf life has gained importance as consumers aim to reduce waste and cut costs.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the appearance of a product\u2019s packaging has declined in significance. This is likely influenced by the increasing trend of online shopping.</p> \n<p>Although environmental impact is considered important by a considerable portion of consumers, its overall importance has decreased since 2020.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, the environmental impact of ocean litter has become the primary concern among environmentally conscious consumers, surpassing other factors such as climate change and deforestation.</p> \n<h2>Limited understanding of sustainable packaging materials</h2> \n<p>The survey highlighted that US consumers lack clarity on which packaging types are most sustainable.</p> \n<p>While compostable and plant-based packaging are perceived as the most sustainable, there is a lack of consensus on other packaging types.</p> \n<p>Moreover, many consumers lack confidence in identifying recyclable packaging, indicating a need for better education and information about sustainability.</p> \n<h2>Willingness to pay more for sustainable packaging</h2> \n<p>Approximately half of US consumers express a willingness to pay more for sustainable packaging, with the highest interest found in fresh fruit, vegetables, and beverages.</p> \n<p>However, most consumers are only willing to pay a small premium for green packaging. Only a minority of consumers are willing to pay significantly higher premiums.</p> \n<h2>The path to success in sustainable packaging</h2> \n<p>The survey results underscore the need for a granular approach when it comes to sustainable packaging in the US market. While certain subsets of consumers show a strong commitment to sustainability, preferences and priorities vary across different segments.</p> \n<p>Packaging players need to understand the specific needs and preferences of different end-user groups to create a packaging solution that aligns with their values.</p> \n<p>There is no universal solution for packaging players, and a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to succeed. Instead, an incremental and tailored strategy that considers consumers\u2019 purchasing behaviour, product usage, and disposal habits is necessary. It is essential for companies to address pain points related to recycling and other sustainability practices to offer packaging solutions that resonate with consumers.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the survey reveals that sustainability has the potential to drive growth for products with clear environmental credentials. Companies that can effectively meet the demands of environmentally conscious consumers are likely to outperform their competitors.</p> \n<p>However, success in the sustainable packaging market requires a deep understanding of consumer preferences and a flexible approach that evolves with changing attitudes and market dynamics.</p> \n<p>As the world navigates through the uncertainties of the post-pandemic era, sustainability will continue to be a key consideration for consumers.</p> \n<p>Companies that embrace sustainable packaging and adapt to consumers\u2019 evolving attitudes stand to gain a competitive advantage in this increasingly important market segment.</p> \n"}]}

Examples of safety features to add to mailing bags include tamper-evident seals, security pouches, or RFID tracking.

In addition, they reduce the risk of loss or damage and enhance credibility.</p> \n<h3>Environmental impact</h3> \n<p>Modern-day consumers are increasingly eco-conscious. Therefore, businesses should opt for mailing bags made from sustainable materials like recycled paper, biodegradable plastics, or compostable materials. These mailers can help reduce their carbon footprint and align with environmentally responsible practices, thus appealing to environmentally conscious customers.</p> \n<h3>Laws and regulations</h3> \n<p>Laws and regulations governing packaging and shipping can vary by region and type of product. For example, theFair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA)in the US requires labeling of consumer products. In this case, businesses must provide details such as commodity identity, net contents, product manufacturer\u2019s name and location, and packer or distributor on the packaging. Therefore, companies should familiarize themselves with packaging requirements or restrictions to avoid potential legal issues or shipping delays.</p> \n<h3>Customization</h3> \n<p>Mailing bag customizationallows businesses to enhance brand identity and customer experience. The packaging can include specific design elements, such as the company logo, color scheme, fonts, or sustainability information.

Therefore, it pays for businesses to make thoughtful, strategic decisions when designing and manufacturing takeaway packaging.</p> \n<p>Below are some tips that can aid in creating eye-catching takeaway bags:</p> \n<h3>1) Choose the right materials</h3> \n<p>Choosing the right materials \u2013 such as paper, cardboard, plastic, or eco-friendly materials \u2013 for the takeaway bags is crucial. The decision should be based on the type of food or beverage to be packaged and whether the materials align with the brand\u2019s values. For example, businesses that emphasize environmental sustainability should opt for eco-friendly options such as biodegradable paper or reusable fabric.</p> \n<h3>2) Factor in the size and shape</h3> \n<p>The size and shape of the takeaway packaging should be well-suited to the type of food served. For example, smaller bags are ideal for individual items like sandwiches, while larger ones are better for family-sized orders. Ultimately, the size and shape of the takeaway packaging should prevent spillage or damage during transportation and align with the desired food presentation.</p> \n<h3>3) Prioritize sustainability</h3> \n<p>Sustainability, as reflected in a brand\u2019s packaging, can influence customers\u2019 decision-making. For instance, report findings indicate that74%of environmentally aware consumers would pay more for sustainable packaging. Therefore, businesses should opt for materials and designs that reduce environmental impact, such as biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable materials. They should also communicate these sustainability efforts to customers through branding and messaging.</p> \n<h3>4) Add design and branding</h3> \n<p>Incorporating design elements and branding on takeaway bags can leave a lasting impression on customers. Takeaway packaging should be customized with unique logos, color schemes, and eye-catching graphics to reinforce brand identity. For example, Coca-Cola\u2019s iconic red and white logo, glass bottle, and the slogan \u201copen happiness\u201d have helped it continue to stand out in the market. Other designs to consider are minimalist and colorful patterns, as well as floral or natural designs.</p> \n<h3>5) Ensure functionality</h3> \n<p>Last but not least, takeaway bags and containers should be functional. For instance, they should be easy to open, close, and carry. Therefore, businesses should consider adding features like secure closures, handles, or insulation to help maintain freshness. These all help to enhance the overall customer experience.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Food packaging helps businesses communicate their values and connect with their target customers. Incorporating trends into takeaway packaging also makes it more likely that their packaging aligns with current consumer preferences. However, these factors should not come at the expense of functionality or sustainability. Finally, adding various design and branding elements and using appropriate materials can result in higher customer satisfaction.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re looking for the latest food container and takeaway products, browse thousands of options onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

The trend has gained massive momentum in recent years and is set to persist through this year and beyond.</p> \n<p>This article explores three reasons businesses should switch to sustainable food packaging, before uncovering five must-know sustainable food packaging trends on the rise.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhy use sustainable packaging?Five latest sustainable food packaging trends to watch out forGo green with these trends</p> \n<h2>Why use sustainable food packaging?</h2> \n<p>Sustainablefood packaginghas been gaining enough traction to replace traditional alternatives as the standard. More consumers are adopting an eco-friendly mindset, making it the perfect time to switch to green.</p> \n<p>Currently, theglobal sustainable food packaging industrywill reach USD 229.38 billion, with the potential to hit USD 316.31 billion by 2027.</p> \n<p>Still not convinced about switching to sustainable food packaging? Here are three reasons to make businesses think otherwise.</p> \n<p>The emphasis on sustainable food packaging centers on embracing renewable resources like bioplastics, compostable or biodegradable substances, and responsibly-sourced paper.</p> \n<p>These choices aim to decrease dependence on limited resources while fostering a circular economy and attracting eco-conscious customers (over50% of global consumersin 2021). Furthermore, sustainable packaging possesses straightforward recyclability, guaranteeing effective processing and reuse.</p> \n<p>Waste reduction across the packaging life cycle is a pivotal benefit of sustainable food packaging. It allows businesses to fine-tune packaging dimensions, lower material consumption, avoid unnecessary components/layers, and adopt lightweight designs.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this waste reduction helps businesses save costs while curtailing their ecological impact.</p> \n<p>Sustainable packaging frequently adopts inventive concepts that amplify its environmental compatibility. These concepts encompass ideas like edible packaging, striving to eradicate waste entirely, or minimalist packaging that curbs the use of excessive materials.</p> \n<p>By embracing innovation, businesses can push sustainability\u2019s limits and uncover imaginative solutions that foster environmental well-being and a rewarding consumer experience.</p> \n<h2>Five latest sustainable food packaging trends to watch out for</h2> \n<h3>Minimalist packaging</h3> \n<p>Minimalism embodies clarity and efficiency. But food packaging\u2019sminimalist designemploys clean lines, strong typography, and a restricted color range for a visually impactful and easily understandable package.</p> \n<p>Minimalist packaging is not restricted to aesthetics. It also prioritizes reducing unnecessary materials and enhancing space efficiency. As a result,minimalist food packagingreduces waste without sacrificing product protection, placing it among the top eco-friendly packaging solutions.</p> \n<p>More importantly,minimalist packagingstrongly appeals to consumers seeking to protect natural resources.A studydisclosed that 92% of consumers gravitate towards businesses using eco-friendly, biodegradable, or minimalist packaging.</p> \n<p>At its core,minimalist packagingavoids attention-grabbing details that can remove the consumer\u2019s focus from the products. They\u2019re also recyclable since manufacturers avoid complicating minimalist packages with additional materials, adhesives, or other elements.</p> \n<p>Interestingly,minimalist packagingkeeps growing and evolving, increasing the chances that designs will become more simplistic and require fewer materials, resulting in the ultimate combination of maximum simplicity and minimum environmental impact.</p> \n<h3>Bioplastics</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s no secret that single-use plastics harm the environment. This is why recent trends push for eco-friendly food packaging \u2013 andbioplasticsoffer a key solution here. In fact,bioplasticsare gaining attention for their explosive potential in food packaging because they don\u2019t feature harmful chemicals or feel risky for the end users. On top of this, bioplastics don\u2019t attract dangerous bacteria or send chemicals back into the environment, making them practical for food packaging.</p> \n<p>Although they\u2019re similar to traditional plastics,bioplasticsare in an entirely different world \u2013 and they come without the environmental drawbacks of conventional plastics.</p> \n<p>In a clear reflection of consumer priorities,74%are willing to invest more in sustainable packaging. Impressively, nearly a quarter of these consumers are even prepared to absorb an additional cost of 10% or higher. This compelling market sentiment underscores the growing appeal of bioplastics as a fantastic option for eco-friendly food brands.</p> \n<p>Plus, research says the bioplastics will experiencesignificant growthover the coming years as more brands switch from harmful plastics to sustainable alternatives.</p> \n<h3>Edible packaging</h3> \n<p>More consumers are becoming environmentally conscious, increasing demand for greener packaging solutions. Responding to this demand, companies have introduced a surprising innovation to the market:edible packaging. This unexpected move has sent ripples through the industry, capturing everyone\u2019s attention.</p> \n<p>Whiledigestible packagingmight have appeared implausible initially, it has evolved into one of the most impactful strategies in the battle against plastic waste. Its potential is so significant it could usher in an era of zero waste.</p> \n<p>True to its name,edible food packagingfeatures designs that end users can consume or biodegrade like the food it encases. The transient nature of its design is what positions edible food packaging as a remarkably sustainable alternative.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless,edible packagingcomes with its share of limitations. For instance, specific versions require supplementary packaging to shield them from contaminants and ensure they\u2019re consumable.</p> \n<p>Moreover, concerns about theedible packaging\u2019shygiene may arise, particularly when exposed to varying environmental conditions during transportation.</p> \n<p>Regardless of these issues,edible packagingis still gaining momentum due to the potential to fix its drawbacks \u2014 and research agrees. Experts say demand foredible packagingmay increase at a 14.31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by 2030, reaching USD 2.8 billion globally.</p> \n<p>Leading the market are innovative products that demonstrate the potential of edible straws, wraps, and food containers.</p> \n<h3>Compostable materials</h3> \n<p>These packaging solutions take a different approach to sustainability. Manufacturers blend diverse recycled and plant-based materials to create a fullyenvironmentally-friendly solution. In contrast to other alternatives that can release harmful chemicals upon disposal, compostable packaging contributes positively to the environment by enhancing soil health.</p> \n<p>Creating the ideal environment for microorganisms to thrive and break downcompostable packagingis crucial. Compost bins offer the perfect setting for this sustainable food packaging, providing the necessary elements such as nutrients, moisture, oxygen, and warmth to create optimal conditions for decomposition.</p> \n<p>Under optimal circumstances,compostable packagingcan break down within 12 weeks, transitioning into a rich, crumbly topsoil with an earthy scent. Then, consumers can dispose of them into the garden soil, enriching it with nutrients.</p> \n<p>Here are some of the most popularcompostable materialsbusinesses can use for their sustainable packaging:</p> \n<p>The market for compostable packaging also looks promising. Research predicts it will garnerUSD 18.9 billionin total revenue. Additionally, experts anticipate the demand for compostable food packaging to boost a 4.5% CAGR between 2023 and 2033.</p> \n<h3>Refillable packaging</h3> \n<p>Refillable packagingoffers two distinct perspectives. The first perspective considers this packaging option as a means for consumers to continuously use a product by replenishing its contents when depleted.</p> \n<p>The second follows the lines of recycling. In this perspective, businesses use packaging made fromrecyclable materials, allowing them to refurbish or re-manufacture when consumers return empty containers.</p> \n<p>Although both perspectives differ, they have one thing in common: minimizing ecological footprint. In its entirety,refillable packagingreduces the need to manufacture new packaging, setting it firmly on the sustainable and cost-saving path.</p> \n<p>Some businesses may go further by motivating consumers to participate in refill programs. Customers can bring back theirinitial containersand receive a discounted price for a refill.</p> \n<p>More importantly, therefillable packaging marketwill exponentially grow in the upcoming years. Experts anticipate growing from USD 109.67 billion in 2022 to USD 159.54 billion in 2029 at a 5.5% CAGR.</p> \n<h2>Go green with these trends</h2> \n<p>Sustainable packaging is crucial for food businesses seeking to satisfy consumer demand for environmentally-friendly options. In truth, switching to sustainablefood packaginghighlights a commitment to waste reduction, resource conservation, and recycling practices.</p> \n<p>However, meeting the demand for eco-friendly packaging requires strategies like life cycle assessments, eco-design principles, and collaborations with reliable, sustainable packaging manufacturers, ensuring their food packaging aligns with sustainability principles.</p> \n<p>Remember to watch out for minimalist, bioplastic, edible, compostable, and refillable sustainable food packaging as they\u2019ll dominate the industry.</p> \n"}]}

Schemes like DRS can help, since they increase the amount of packaging being recycled and offer consumers an added incentive to make more eco-friendly choices.\u201d</p> \n<h2>FMCG companies step up their efforts to reduce plastics</h2> \n<p>The packaging industry and manufacturers are accelerating their efforts to further reduce plastics in the supply chain. Global food and beverage companies have set a number of goals around virgin plastic packaging reduction and are developing a pipeline of new initiatives to help achieve them.</p> \n<p>Kraft Heinz has set new goals to minimise the use of virgin plastic by up to 20% by 2030, having already transitioned to 30% recycled content for most of its bottles sold in the UK, Brazil, and European markets. In partnership with Pulpex, the company is developing a paper-based, recyclable bottle using 100% sustainably sourced wood pulp for its Heinz Tomato Ketchup product. Currently, a prototype of the bottle is being tested to determine its performance before being launched into the market.</p> \n<p>PepsiCo estimates that its plastic packaging reduction initiatives could eliminate more than 400,000 metric tons of virgin material by 2030. To achieve this goal, the company is designing packaging to minimize the use of materials, switching to alternative, environmentally friendly materials and working to reinvent packaging to reduce the need for single use plastics through reusable or low/no package models.</p> \n<p>Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is investing in recycling start-up CuRe Technology to support efforts to eliminate virgin plastics in its bottles. The company has developed a \u2018polyester rejuvenation\u2019 technology which targets difficult-to-recycle polyester, such as material containing coloured pigments, transforming it into high quality rPET. This has created a new source of rPET with a carbon footprint claimed to be approximately 65% lower than virgin PET.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Plastipak Packaging and LanzaTech Global are working in partnership to create the world\u2019s first PET resin, PPKNatura, from captured carbon emissions, which has the properties of virgin fossil PET but carries a reduced carbon footprint.</p> \n<p>\u201cIndustry players and leading FMCG brands continue to advance work on reducing virgin plastic in their supply chains by replacing it with plant-based and recycled plastic content,\u201dadds Sundar.\u201cAlthough a game-changing solution to eliminate virgin PET altogether remains elusive, the direction of travel is clear and further new technological developments could well provide a safe and commercially viable alternative in the years to come.\u201d</p> \n"}]}

This is in line with the global expansion of web-based and internet-related businesses. However, for those aiming to succeed in this booming industry, it\u2019s worth exploring the peripheral opportunities associated with it. One such opportunity is packaging catering to online retailers\u2019 needs.</p> \n<p>This article will explore this expanding niche, highlighting the market potential, as well as the latestpackaging trendsfor online retailers.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOnline retail market overviewHot packaging trends for online retailersWrapping up</p> \n<h2>Online retail market overview</h2> \n<p>In line with the growth in ecommerce, the number of global online shoppers has been rising significantly too. It was estimated that there were around 2.05 billion online buyers in 2020, with an increase to around2.14 billion buyers in 2021.</p> \n<p>In fact, the actual numbers of worldwide online shoppers up to 2022 appears to have increased at a much higher rate than the above estimation according to a reportby Oberlo. Based on that report, the total number of online shoppers in the whole world is expected to jump to 2.64 billion\u2013a number that signifies that one out of every three people on Earth shops online!</p> \n<p>With online shopping growing at such a remarkable rate, it is not only becoming the norm but is expected toovertake brick-and-mortar stores by 2040, with predictions that up to 95% of all purchases will be made online by then. This demonstrates a rosy outlook for the online retail sector, which is why wholesalers who are looking to break into the online retail market can consider zeroing in on the related e-commercepackaging trendsnow.</p> \n<h2>Hot packaging trends for online retailers</h2> \n<h3>Flexible packaging</h3> \n<p>As the name implies, flexible packaging refers to packaging that is made of easily moldable, foldable, or shapeable materials. These include those made from plastic, paper, film, and foil, all of which enable retailers to prepare packages of different sizes, shapes, and setups.</p> \n<p>Ametallic bubble mailerthat can serve as a pouch with protective packaging or simply as a padded envelope is one such great example of flexible packaging. Its adaptability is reflected not only in the vast assortment of products it can support but also in terms of branding and packaging design customization.</p> \n<p>The fact that most flexible packaging materials exhibit excellent barrier properties, helping to protect the packaged contents from moisture, oxygen, and other gasses, also makes it an outstanding choice for food and beverage packaging to help ensure product freshness and longevity. Thisfood-grade flexible film packaging pouch, for instance, allows flexible-size packaging for multiple food-related products such as protein powders, candy, and other instant beverage sachets.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile,flexible packaging made of aluminum foilis capable of offering user-friendly easy-open tear notches and resealable zippers for closures, thereby enhancing customer experience and contributing to the overall appeal of the product.</p> \n<p>For wholesalers who are looking to save on shipping charges and improve shipping efficiency, flexible packaging also provides an excellent solution in lowering transportation costs given their thin, lightweight nature that is designed to fit snugly around different products. It is also worth noting that on top of sealable zippers, aluminum foils are capable of supporting other additional food-freshness features such as thisnitrogen-fillable flexible aluminum foil packaging.</p> \n<h3>Personalized packaging</h3> \n<p>The speed and convenience of online shopping signify a much more efficient and interactive shopping experience between shoppers and online retailers. This fosters an encouraging atmosphere for personalized packaging, with retailers now having the ability to easily customize and update their desired personalized message and packaging directly with any businesses that offer such services.</p> \n<p>In fact,personalizationoffered by the big, international players including Starbucks and Sephora is nothing new but rather an ongoing, growing trend that is well-received by consumers. While these renowned brands primarily implement personalization by taking into account the personal preferences, past actions, and personalized messages of their consumers, online retailers mostly relied on personalized packaging to provide a unique unboxing experience for their customers.</p> \n<p>Personalized packing solutions for online retailers are commonly achieved through the utilization of stickers or labels, which is now made possible at a lower cost even for small quantities thanks to digital printing.Customizable boxes with transparent lidsor even somebespoke pet transportation boxesare some great examples that support digital prints.</p> \n<p>Additionally, digital printing personalization offers a wide selection of possibilities beyond just boxes or specificpackaging types. For example, it also coversstanding pouches or zipper bagsas well as assortedbeverage and liquid product packagingsuch as those depicted in the picture below:</p> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>With most end-users becoming more and more conscious about the environmental impact that their packaging waste has on the surroundings, sustainable packaging has been discussed extensively over the past few years across the packaging industry for almost all types of products. This is especially true when it comes to online shopping as ecommerce drives a significant increase in packaging waste due to online shopping typically necessitating the use of much more packaging material for product protection during delivery.</p> \n<p>In fact,in a studyby ecommerce fulfillment company PFS, more than 60% of consumers among the 4,000 respondents (divided equally between the US and UK) voiced their expectation to have sustainable packaging available as an option when shopping online. With all this data in mind, it is therefore getting more important for online retailers to take environmental considerations into account and choose the most sustainable packaging solutions available to match consumers\u2019 expectations.</p> \n<p>Fortunately for online retailers, sustainable packaging is a realistic and accessible solution. As featured in the image below,biodegradable mailer bagsand envelope-style mailers made of sustainable materials likeKraft paper with bubble liningsare obvious examples of eco-friendly packaging options well-suited for online retailers who handle a full range of products, including small and miniature-sized items.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, acorrugated mailer boxmade from corrugated board is another sustainable packaging option that is highly recommended for online retailers due to its sturdy structure and foldable and collapsible features. In the same vein, but with a slight twist, foldable paper boxes offer a lighter, more versatile, and equally environmentally conscious alternative to corrugated boxes, for example, thisminimalist style simple paper-made foldable gift box.</p> \n<p>For items that are not suitable for boxes or small mailer bags, aKraft paper tubeis a highly recommended packaging option for e-commerce companies. These paper tubes provide a unique and eco-friendly way to package products, especially for those with cylindrical shapes, as shown in the picture above.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>The extensive adoption of online shopping by consumers, coupled with the advancements in virtual reality and artificial intelligence, suggests a significant expansion of internet-based businesses and related peripheral industries, such as packaging that caters to online retailers\u2019 needs.</p> \n<p>Looking ahead, flexible packaging, personalized packaging, and sustainable packaging will no doubt shape the overall packaging direction for online stores. For wholesalers aiming to expand their e-commerce businesses, exploring these trends to offer online retailers exceptional packaging solutions is the key to tapping into this growth.

For adults, it\u2019s a great way to escape the chaos of life by personalizing gifts and decorating journals, jewelry, stationery, and more. For children, washi tape can improve motor skills, inspire creativity, and be used for games, providing hours of family entertainment.</p> \n<p>In this article, you\u2019ll find 12 creative and fun uses for washi tape, suitable for all ages.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat is washi tape and why is it popular?How to use washi tape for arts and craftsHow to play with washi tape for young kidsConclusion</p> \n<h2>What is washi tape and why is it popular?</h2> \n<p>Washi tape is a fun and sustainable way to play, decorate, and learn without creating too much mess. It works as a type of masking tape but, rather than being made from non-sustainable plastics, is made from materials such as bamboo or rice paper. This means it can be torn easily and without the need for scissors, making it a perfect learning and crafting tool for children.</p> \n<p>Washi tape comes in many shapes, sizes, colors, and styles, opening up the potential for a huge collection. There\u2019s also no limit to its potential usage: decorate a pencil holder with flower and polka dot washi tape, cover a door with colorful stripes, mark a diary incute kawaii characters, make glasses gold and sparkly, and so much more.Washi tape dispensersalso help to keep a collector\u2019s tape all in one place.</p> \n<p>Washi tape can help younger children to improve their motor skills as they attempt to stick it in straight lines or around circular objects. It can also help stimulate their creativity as they decide which colors and patterns to put together, where to put them, and how to decorate various objects. Finally, washi tape can help children of all ages to learn how to play in a way that isn\u2019t reliant on technology. Instead, washi tape gives us the opportunity to relearn simple games such as hop-scotch, noughts and crosses, and storytelling, in a colorful way.</p> \n<p>Washi tape has become a core component of arts and crafts among adults. The wide range of colors and styles available means that no matter their personal taste, adults will always be able to find a washi tape perfect for them. It can be used for decorative purposes to create individual styles and even as painters tape to define edges around a room. Perhaps most importantly, washi tape can help adults take a breather from daily life, allowing them to enter the calming world of art.</p> \n<h2>How to use washi tape for arts and crafts</h2> \n<h3>Decorating wooden bracelets</h3> \n<p>Decorating wooden bracelets with washi tape is a fantastic way to personalize an otherwise simple piece of jewelry. For example, crafters can use washi tape to cover all sorts of pieces \u2013 from wooden bangles and wooden bracelets with ties to wooden beaded bracelets \u2013 with their favorite colors and patterns.</p> \n<h3>Making personalized stationery</h3> \n<p>Washi tape can also allow individuals to stand out from the crowd at school or in the office, and as a way of ensuring they never lose them again, by decorating their stationery whatever way they please.</p> \n<h3>Decorating picture frames, lipsticks, plant pots, and pencil holders</h3> \n<p>Washi tape\u2019s bright colors and elegant designs means that it can be used to decorate any item.</p> \n<p>Better yet, the same tape can be used to decorate a whole collection of objects, such as picture frames, lipsticks, plant pots, and pencil holders, creating a unique personal collection in their preferred style.</p> \n<h3>Personalizing puzzles and other games</h3> \n<p>Decorating the backs of puzzles and cards, jenga blocks, and other fun table games is another way to add a touch of personalization using washi tape. Decorating games can also expand their usage. For example, adding colors or messages onto the blocks or pieces of a game can help create new rules. If decorating jenga blocks, gamers could decide that each color means a different thing \u2013 if someone removes a green block, maybe they have to do a dare, or if they remove a purple block, perhaps they will have to play two truths and a lie.</p> \n<h3>Expressing moods with washi tape journaling and journal decoration</h3> \n<p>When journaling, washi tape can be used to help with expressing mood too. For example, if the journaller is feeling somber, they could decorate the entry in dark colors or with sad and angrykawaii washi characters. Likewise, if they\u2019re feeling upbeat, they could use lively summer colors or flowers.</p> \n<h3>Creating perfectly wrapped gifts</h3> \n<p>Gifting is another aspect where washi tape can help transform an otherwise bland present into something special. It can be easily used as a packing tape to create elegant and perfectly wrapped gifts for loved ones. It is important to cut the washi packing tape correctly when gifting so as to avoid messy edges. To do this, gift-wrappers should invest in a tape dispenser with a cutter, such as a cute doughnut orheart-shaped tape dispenser.</p> \n<h2>How to play with washi tape for young kids</h2> \n<h3>Making a washi tape mural</h3> \n<p>Unlike paint, pens, duct tape, and packing tape, washi tape won\u2019t peel off walls or leave permanent stains. This makes it great for novice mural painters. It can be used to decorate walls, attach photographs to the walls, or even as a storytime tape, where one person draws something on the wall using washi tape and the next person expands on that drawing, slowly creating a story mural.</p> \n<h3>Creating floor games with washi tape</h3> \n<p>Just as with walls, washi tape does not leave marks on floorboards and can be easily removed. This means it can be used to create floor games, such as hopscotch, noughts and crosses, and hangman, or even to demarcate tracks for small bicycles or toy car races.</p> \n<h3>Tracking growth with washi tape growth charts</h3> \n<p>Washi tape can also be used as a height tracker, noting down a child\u2019s height on a door frame or wall. This method not only shows how much a child has grown but also how their tastes change over time, with the type of tape that they choose reflecting their current favorite washi theme or color.</p> \n<h3>Making stick and washi tape puppets</h3> \n<p>Creating stick men and hand puppets is another imaginative and fun activity that can be achieved with washi tape. This activity combines creation and storytelling, meaning it\u2019s the perfect way to play as a family while improving childrens\u2019 motor skills and creativity. Additionally, these puppets can be used for games or kept by parents as a cherished memory.</p> \n<h3>Learning colors and counting</h3> \n<p>Washi tape can also be used to help children learn simple skills such as colors or counting. One example is to tape off 10 squares with a number under each and then to ask the child to place that many marbles, beads, or other small items into each square. This game helps children make the connection between numbers and quantities.</p> \n<p>These types of games can also be used to help children learn colors and shapes, such as by asking them to place their pink toys in a pink triangle made using washi tape, or their green toys in a green square.</p> \n<h3>Making a washi tape name for kids\u2019 rooms</h3> \n<p>Personalizing a bedroom is a big part of creating individuality, and there is no better way than by adding a personal touch. For children\u2019s rooms, especially when there\u2019s more than one, families may want to wrap large cardboard or foam letters with washi tape to spell out their names or simple affirmations such as \u201clive,\u201d \u201clove,\u201d or \u201claugh.\u201d These can be placed on shelves, doors, in windows, and more, and can even be further decorated with fairy lights for an extra special touch.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Playing with washi tape is not only fun, creative, and can enhance our feeling of calm but also has health benefits for children by improving motor skills and concentration. It\u2019s also the perfect sustainable and low-cost item for families, with a huge variety of colors and styles. Thanks to many types ofwashi tapedispenser, stocking a diverse range of these tapes can provide a lucrative opportunity for arts and crafts businesses, kids toy shops, or education centers.</p> \n"}]}

Astonishingly,40%of all food in America is wasted, having a negative impact on the environment as well as household budgets.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s estimated that a four-person family may lose at least US $1500 a year to wasted food. The good news is that there are many simple ways to keep mouthwatering fruits and vegetables from spoiling. Keep reading to discover nine nifty hacks to keep food fresh, with or without a fridge!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMonitor your fridge\u2019s temperature levelsUnderstand your fridge\u2019s compartmentsUnlock your freezer\u2019s potentialMake use of your cupboardsAvoid washing fresh producePreserve food freshness with biodegradable filmWrap perishable foods in ziplock bagsPrevent oxidation with greaseproof paperExtend the shelf life of perishables with dry ice packs3 factors to keep in mind when storing perishable foods</p> \n<h2>1. Monitor your fridge\u2019s temperature levels</h2> \n<p>When it comes to keeping food fresh, your refrigerator\u2019s temperature is the most critical factor. Maintaining the right temperature not only ensures that dairy products, meat, and other perishable food items stay fresh but also helps to keep bacteria growth in check.</p> \n<p>Setting the refrigerator\u2019s temperature between 2-4\u00b0C (35-40\u00b0F) provides an optimal environment for preserving a food\u2019s freshness. However, it\u2019s crucial to avoid over-stuffing the fridge; when a refrigerator is packed to the brim, air circulation is restricted, which can lead to uneven cooling.</p> \n<p>Thankfully,modern refrigeratorsequipped with intelligent temperature control systems can maintain stable temperatures effortlessly, ensuring no corner of the fridge is too warm or too cold.</p> \n<h2>2. Understand your fridge\u2019s compartments</h2> \n<p>To ensure the freshness of groceries and leftovers, it\u2019s essential to understand your refrigerator\u2019s different compartments. Here\u2019s a handy guide to help consumers maximize food freshness and minimize waste:</p> \n<h2>3. Unlock your freezer\u2019s potential</h2> \n<p>Freezers, designed to maintain a temperature of -18-23\u00b0C (0-10\u00b0F), preserve the structure of fragile foods by using cold to slow down the rate at which they rot. Within this temperature range, foods retain their texture, flavor, and nutritional value, ensuring that even the most delicate items remain fresh and safe to consume.</p> \n<p>By simply stashing leftovers inplastic bagsorairtight containers, consumers can turn their freezer into a goldmine of delicious meals waiting to be enjoyed. Everything from veggies and meats to tasty baked treats can stay in tip-top shape for weeks or even months without losing their freshness.</p> \n<h2>4. Make use of your cupboards</h2> \n<p>Utilizingcupboardsoffers a straightforward and efficient solution to maintaining the freshness and safety of foods stored at room temperature. These cool, dry spaces create an optimal place to preserve a range of dried goods, including beans, herbs, and spices.</p> \n<p>When people store perishable items in cupboards, they protect them from the detrimental influence of heat, light, and moisture. This storage approach safeguards the natural flavors, textures, and nutrients found in these ingredients, ultimately contributing to safer, more nutritious meals.</p> \n<h2>5. Avoid washing fresh produce</h2> \n<p>Many people believe that washing produce is a way to keep it fresh but, actually, this practice can cause fruits and vegetables to spoil more quickly. The excess moisture created during the washing process can encourage bacterial growth and hasten spoilage. This is especially true for delicate fruits like berries, which can become mushy and inedible if exposed to excess moisture.</p> \n<p>A helpful hack to prolong the freshness of fruits and vegetables is to store them unwashed and wrapped inpaper towels. Paper towels serve a dual purpose: they absorb any residual moisture on the produce, preventing mold growth, while also maintaining a barrier between the fruits and vegetables and any contaminants in the refrigerator or on the storage surface.</p> \n<h2>6. Preserve food freshness with biodegradable film</h2> \n<p>Biodegradable filmsoffer an excellent solution for keeping food fresh, particularly for eco-friendly consumers looking to steer clear ofplastic packaging. These versatile films not only fend off bacteria but also stop moisture from infiltrating food items like bread and leftovers.</p> \n<p>Another sustainable trick for preserving food freshness is by wrapping them withedible films. Crafted from natural components such as vegetable oils, starches, and proteins, these films help prolong the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. They work by keeping bacteria at bay and minimizing moisture loss.</p> \n<p>These food-grade packaging techniques are perfect for maintaining the freshness of produce over extended periods, all the while eliminating concerns about harmful chemicals seeping into the food.</p> \n<h2>7. Wrap perishable foods in ziplock bags</h2> \n<p>Mold and moisture both have a knack for infiltrating our favorite foods, rendering them inedible before we have a chance to savor every last bite.Ziplock bagsprovide a reliable barrier against these contamination factors.</p> \n<p>These airtight bags feature an impermeable sealing mechanism, effectively excluding moisture and inhibiting contamination by microbes. You can even add adesiccant bagto the sealed package to help remove oxygen, reducing the rate of chemical reactions within and slowing the chemical processes that lead to spoilage.</p> \n<h2>8. Prevent oxidation with greaseproof paper</h2> \n<p>When food is exposed to oxygen, oxidation occurs, which can cause food to spoil and lose its flavor. Some moisture-sensitive foods, like dairy products and specific kinds of fish, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of oxidation. If these foods are left unwrapped or out in the open air for an extended period, they can turn rancid and deteriorate quite rapidly.</p> \n<p>Greaseproof paper, a type of thick waxed paper, serves as an excellent barrier against oxygen and moisture. By enveloping food items with this impermeable layer, the chance of oxidation is significantly reduced. Moreover, a thin layer of grease or oil will help deter water absorption by forming an invisible barrier between the paper and the food or dishware.</p> \n<h2>9. Extend the shelf life of perishables with dry ice packs</h2> \n<p>Dry ice packsare made from carbon dioxide, which does not have a liquid state at normal atmospheric pressure, therefore sublimating directly from the solid state to the gas state. This phenomenon not only absorbs heat but also generates a refreshing cooling effect. As a result, it\u2019s a great tool for anyone without access to refrigeration or in regions where keeping food fresh may be challenging.</p> \n<p>Besides their impressive cooling properties, dry ice packs don\u2019t leave a watery mess behind. While traditional ice packs tend to melt and leave condensation behind, dry ice packs ensure that food packages remain dry and spotless. As a result, they are particularly handy for transporting temperature-sensitive foods during picnics, camping excursions, and beach outings.</p> \n<h2>3 factors to keep in mind when storing perishable foods</h2> \n<p>At the end of the day, keeping food fresh is all about controlling three factors:</p> \n<p>Whether you use an airtight container or store food in a temperature-controlled refrigerator, knowing how to control these three factors helps to keep perishable foods fresh for longer.

To replace traditional plastic packaging, many companies are now turning to sturdy and reusable wood and bamboo packaging.</p> \n<p>This brief guide will help buyers navigate the range of wooden and bamboo packaging available on the market today, so they can find the best solution for their needs.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsGrowth of wooden and bamboo packagingWhat is wooden and bamboo packaging?Factors to consider when choosing wooden and bamboo packagingHow to prevent insects in wooden and bamboo packagingTypes of wooden and bamboo packagingExport policies of wooden and bamboo packagingThe future of eco-friendly packaging</p> \n<h2>Growth of wooden and bamboo packaging</h2> \n<p>Althoughwooden and bamboo packagingisn\u2019t a new invention, the market is seeing a significant increase in demand for these products from many different industries. Consumers are now more likely than ever to choose a product that\u2019s been packaged using renewable resources that can also be reused after its original purpose.</p> \n<p>In terms of the global market value of this type of packaging, the bamboo packaging market is set to reach at least USD 895.1 million by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% between 2022 and 2032. Wooden packaging is also seeing a large increase in sales. By 2025 the wooden packaging market is expected to rise toUSD 4.21 billionand will have a CAGR of 5.39% over a 5 year period.</p> \n<h2>What is wooden and bamboo packaging?</h2> \n<p>When it comes toeco-friendly packaging, businesses now have a variety of materials to choose from that weren\u2019t available even a decade ago. Wood packaging comes from trees such as oak, fir, beech, and willow and is known in the industry for its strength, resistance to corrosion, and moisture absorption.</p> \n<p>Bamboo packaging, on the other hand, is known for packaging lighter products and comes from the grass family. The packaging is biodegradable and can be composted at home if necessary since it contains no harmful or toxic materials. Bamboo packaging is a fantastic option for keeping products protected and is one of the top selling alternatives to plastic.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when choosing wooden and bamboo packaging</h2> \n<p>As with all packaging types, there are some important factors to take into account before purchasing either wood or bamboo packaging. These include:</p> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>Depending on what type of product is being packaged, the size is a definite selling point. The size of the packaging needs to completely cover the product but at the same time should have some extra space inside for either extra padded packaging, such as biodegradable packing peanuts, or to allow for extra movement so the product isn\u2019t touching the edges.</p> \n<h3>Weight</h3> \n<p>For the most part, packaging should be lightweight. This will not only cut down on shipping costs but will also have less of an impact on the environment. Bamboo is a much lighter material than wood, which is why a lot of companies now use it to not only package their products but also ship their items in.</p> \n<h3>Closure type</h3> \n<p>Wooden packaging most commonly comes in the form of boxes, and with these boxes there are different closure types to take into account. These can include a sliding lid, clasp, hinged lid, or a pop-off lid. These types of closures can also be considered for bamboo packaging, but bamboo is also used to make shipping bags, where closures such as zippered, sealed, and air compressed should be considered.</p> \n<h3>Durability</h3> \n<p>There\u2019s nothing worse than having low quality packaging materials. Luckily, both wood and bamboo are two of the most durable types of packaging on the market. Bamboo packaging bags, for example, are ideal for shipping clothing as they\u2019re waterproof and can be disposed of later with no harm to the environment. Wooden boxes too are good for shipping more delicate goods such as bottles of wine as they\u2019re less likely to break upon impact.</p> \n<h2>How to prevent insects in wooden and bamboo packaging</h2> \n<p>Both wood and bamboo are natural resources meaning they are more susceptible to insects than other types of packaging material. Some tips to consider concerning how to prevent insects getting into wooden and bamboo packaging are: keep the materials inside whenever possible, keep the packaging away from living trees, don\u2019t store the materials in open areas where there is grass or weeds, keep the wood or bamboo off of the ground, and ensure that the raw materials aren\u2019t stored under lights that can attract insects.</p> \n<h2>Types of wooden and bamboo packaging</h2> \n<p>Both wood and bamboo can be used in various industries, which is what makes both materials so versatile. The most popular types of packing today include wooden wine boxes, bamboo clothing packaging, bamboo cosmetic boxes, and wooden jewelry and watch boxes.</p> \n<h3>Wooden wine boxes</h3> \n<p>Wooden boxesare often used to display expensive bottles of wine or to present wine as a gift. Compared to bamboo, which is also used for wine boxes now, wood is slightly sturdier and gives off a more elegant look and finish to the box. These boxes can be fully customized and lined with a velvet padding to really complete the high-end look of the box as a whole.</p> \n<p>There are different types ofwooden wine boxesto consider though. One of the most popular styles has a sliding lid on the top that allows for easy opening and is ideal for displaying the bottle on a store shelf. Other types of boxes include ones with ahinged closureand in some cases magnetic lids are being used. One thing\u2019s for sure, there\u2019s never any complaints when it comes to wooden wine boxes.</p> \n<h3>Bamboo clothing packaging</h3> \n<p>Bamboo is a very versatile material to use in packaging, which is why it\u2019s quickly becoming the top alternative to plastic. The apparel industry is increasingly using bamboo packaging for clothing, as its properties mean that the clothing inside will be kept safe and dry, and after use the packaging is fullybiodegradable.</p> \n<p>There are different types of bamboo packaging that are being used for clothing. One of these is thebamboo shipping bag, which is often used for t-shirts and other lightweight items of clothing. Another example is thebamboo box, which can be used to hold multiple items of clothing or in most cases it\u2019s used to hold shoes. Bamboo is the perfect non-wood raw material for use in pulping and by using bamboo fiber to create the boxes the packaging becomes fully biodegradable too.</p> \n<h3>Bamboo cosmetic packaging</h3> \n<p>In the cosmetics industry,bamboois turning out to be a fantastic option for cream jars, makeup, and even body lotion and soap. By using bamboo as a replacement for plastic and metal packaging, it helps to cut down on the overall waste produced by the cosmetics industry, and they can easily be reused or refilled once the initial product has come to an end.</p> \n<p>When it comes to cosmetic packaging there are a lot of options for businesses to choose from. The smallcosmetic jarsare used to hold creams and are perfect for traveling thanks to their size.Bamboo cosmetic bottlesare also a good way to store soaps, lotions, and creams and often come in a complete set with different products.</p> \n<h3>Wooden jewelry and watch boxes</h3> \n<p>Jewelry and watches need to be protected, both during transportation and while in storage at a shop or at home.Wooden packagingis very useful for both of these luxury items, and the trend of using wood to hold jewelry and watches is continuing to grow. These boxes can be standard or made of a luxurious wood which helps to elevate the appeal of the item inside.</p> \n<p>Wooden jewelry boxescan come in a variety of sizes, depending on how many watches or pieces of jewelry are inside. The most popular style will have a velvet interior and a space hollowed out for the jewelry to snuggly fit inside without moving. Thewatch boxon the other hand will have a mostly padded interior with a small section that the watch can sit in, with plenty of open space around it so that there is less chance of it becoming damaged.</p> \n<h2>Export policies of wooden and bamboo packaging</h2> \n<p>Now that you have all of the background information about wooden and bamboo packaging, what about the exportation rules? Fully finished products made of wood or bamboo don\u2019t fall under the same exportation rules as raw products. These rules can change depending on the country the product is being exported to so it\u2019s important to check this information before shipping.</p> \n<p>For example, importing wood and bamboo products and packagingto the USAin their raw form must undergo a drying/splitting process and have all of the seeds removed before entering the country. However, if finished products are being imported they don\u2019t need a USDA import permit.</p> \n<h2>The future of eco-friendly packaging</h2> \n<p>There are many factors to consider when choosing the right wooden and bamboo packaging for a business, including the size, weight, closure type, and durability. That being said, as wood and bamboo continue to replace other non-sustainable packaging materials, there are many ways in which they can be used regardless of the industry. Currently, the most popular types of packaging include wooden wine boxes, bamboo clothing packaging, bamboo cosmetic packaging, and wooden jewelry and watch boxes.</p> \n<p>The future of eco-friendly packaging is very bright. Emerging new technologies are constantly creating sustainable materials such as bamboo that can be used across all industries. Plastic is quickly becoming a thing of the past, as consumers are increasingly looking to purchase goods that are packaged using eco-friendly materials.</p> \n"}]}

While some packaging is ideal for holding liquids, others are more suitable for solids, such as soaps. The top trending types of packaging today include the travel soap box, the leather jewelry organizer, the perfume atomizer, mini shampoo bottles, collapsible lotion containers, and mini jars. Below, we take a closer look at each.</p> \n<h3>Boxed travel soaps</h3> \n<p>Not everyone uses liquid soap or enjoys using soap and shampoo from a hotel, so soaps that come in a travel-size box are increasingly popular among this type of discerning consumer. Of course, it\u2019s not uncommon to find thetravel soap boxinside a hotel, as they\u2019re the perfect way to present a small amount of soap to the guest in an elegant way, but today\u2019s market is seeing an increase in individual consumers also looking to purchase such soaps for personal use.</p> \n<p>Thesesoap boxesare ideal for containing a bar of soap while traveling, and can be easily disposed of when no longer in use as they\u2019re made of recyclable materials.

These types of mini travel bottles are predominantly used for shampoos or conditioners, but with the addition of a pump lid, they can also be used to carry lotions.</p> \n<h3>Collapsible lotion containers</h3> \n<p>For consumers who have very limited space at home, or that tend to use all of their personal care products while they\u2019re away, thecollapsible lotion containeris growing in popularity as an alternative to mini plastic bottles.

Whether for safety or aesthetic reasons, or both, packaging plays an undeniably important role in making an impression on the product recipient. The packaging business can be very lucrative if planned correctly. Here are some ideas to become successful at it.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsChoosing a nicheCreating and executing a business planSome final thoughts</p> \n<h2>Choosing a niche</h2> \n<p>This is perhaps the most important step because of its strategic nature. Theright choicecan pay rich dividends; anything else can be a risky gamble.</p> \n<p>A good place to start, for a small business owner, is to observe current packaging trends along with the changing dynamics of customer demands. By identifying and adopting current trends with projections for longer lifespans, one can expect to have a steady business demand. By spotting a changing trend early on and catering to emerging demands, it is even possible to become a market leader.</p> \n<p>Another important consideration is whether the packaging business caters to commodities or specialty products. The former operates on a larger scale, with smaller profit margins and low customization. On the other hand, the latter can be much smaller in size but accommodate more customization and higher profit margins.</p> \n<p>Of course, the financial aspect \u2013 of available capital and funding plans \u2013 will most likely lead the selection process to a decisive conclusion.</p> \n<h2>Creating and executing a business plan</h2> \n<p>After choosing the niche, it\u2019s time to get into the nitty-gritty. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.</p> \n<h3>Deciding business size and scalability</h3> \n<p>By choosing between commodities or specialty products, you already have a preliminary idea about the size of yourpackaging business. Budget considerations and long-term vision further help to decide the operational scale and the extent of future scalability.</p> \n<h3>Creation of business legality</h3> \n<p>Although this is an obvious step, great care is required here, especially during important considerations like taxation. You may want to consider the advantages and disadvantages of proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC) and limited liability partnership (LLP) models to choose and register thetype of business ownershipbest applicable to your needs. You may also wish to consider which is the most tax-efficient.</p> \n<p>With the plan to set up an online business, keep an eye out for the website domain. It\u2019s best to check domain availability for the desired trade name and book it before registering the business. This will increase the likelihood of the website name being the same as the registered company\u2019s name.</p> \n<h3>Sourcing raw materials for product packaging</h3> \n<p>If your online packaging business caters to commodities like FMCGs and FMCDs, the packaging specifications are already fixed and only need to be consistently followed. Thus, the main requirement is for standard-sized packaging, for which boxes and poly mailers of specific thicknesses and textures need to be bulk-purchased.</p> \n<p>If you are dealing with packaging specialty products, there is greater flexibility to experiment and adopt custom packaging which can create a lasting impression on consumers. This requires sourcing different types of raw materials, which can help offer innovative as well as attractive packaging designs and solutions.</p> \n<p>Care must be taken to ensure that all aspects of the packaging \u2013 which includes package quality, packaging style, label selection and printing quality \u2013 are consistent with the product or brand image.</p> \n<h3>Label and printing selection</h3> \n<p>Printing is a very important aspect of the packaging business because its quality and presentation make a direct impression on the consumer regarding the product. Depending upon the product\u2019s price point and the brand name, you can choose between digital and offset printing. Digital Printing is the cheaper option but offset printing is far superior, quality-wise.</p> \n<p>Thelabelson the packaging must clearly display all important product information. This helps to increase product and brand authenticity.Holographic sticker labelscan be used as seals of authenticity. If you are adopting custom packaging,custom printing stickerscan come in handy.</p> \n<h3>E-commerce and building an online presence</h3> \n<p>In the era of e-commerce, having an online presence is very important. Not only is it easy to set up a business online but it also helps to reach large audiences without much legwork.</p> \n<p>Start with a well-designed website with a full portfolio of packaging services. Consider selling directly from your website; this can save you the commission cuts you are subjected to as a registered seller on large e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, or Etsy. However, there\u2019s no denying the fact that such e-commerce giants can bring you a much larger audience than your website alone. Do your research and decide how you wish to proceed.</p> \n<p>Any kind of e-commerce activity needs to be supported by online marketing activities to generate more interest and drive more traffic to your website and/or listed business on other platforms. Ensure that your website is SEO-friendly and set a budget for pay-per-click advertising through Google, Facebook, TikTok, or Instagram. Build community pages on social media sites to engage with visitors and direct them to the business sites.</p> \n<h2>Some final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Doing some careful research in the beginning can help to set up a packaging business with long-term potential for success, while also reducing costs. Implement a good business plan with well-thought-out steps, and invest in marketing the business online to grow it consistently.</p> \n<p>The type of packaging used for a product is an outer reflection of the product sold to the customer. Thus, there must be consistency between the packaging and the value that the product aims to create.</p> \n<p>E-commerce has reshaped the way the world conducts business. Starting an online packaging business has become easier than ever, with no bounds to creativity and scale.</p> \n<p>For more industry knowledge, expert insights, and timely B2B news go toAlibaba Reads.</p> \n"}]}

This is especially so in light of recent health industry disruptions over the past few years, which have greatly increased public concerns over personal care and well-being.</p> \n<p>This article will highlight the market overview of beauty salon packaging, before offering the essential beauty salon packaging trends.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market overview of beauty salon packagingPopular beauty salon packaging trendsA fine blend</p> \n<h2>The market overview of beauty salon packaging</h2> \n<p>One may look at the potential of the packaging market for beauty salons from two distinct angles. First of all, let\u2019s check out the cosmetic packaging market, which encompasses essentially all forms of packaging for products used for makeup, nail, skincare, and hair care since beauty salons often offer all of these services. Another perspective, of course, is related to the global expansion of beauty salon services, which is directly related to the use of the relevant product packaging.</p> \n<p>The global cosmetic packaging industry is expected to grow at a very healthy rate at an estimatedcompound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7%, increased by USD 21.06 billion over the next four years, up to 2027. And the strong growth of beauty salons and spa outlets is credited as one of the main reasons that contribute to this steady rise.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, it is anticipated that the demand for global salon services would grow by more than 60% from its initial estimation of $152 billion in 2021 toaround $245 billionby 2030. This expansion is in spite of small declines in its statistics between 2020 and 2024, which were mostly caused by previous global social distance restrictions.</p> \n<p>All of these positive statistics indicate a generally favorable picture for the beauty salon market while implicitly confirming the expansion of the packaging prospects for related products. In order to capitalize on this ongoing development, which is mostly fueled by rising disposable income and growing demand for personal grooming, let\u2019s now examine the popular trends for beauty salon packaging.</p> \n<h2>Popular beauty salon packaging trends</h2> \n<h3>Gender inclusive packaging</h3> \n<p>While gender-neutralism has long been observedin the fashion industry, gender-inclusive packaging has just emergeda few years ago. In fact, anarticlerevealed that quite a number of salon professionals agreed that shifting to or starting a unisex salon could help them bring in more customers. And the numbers of unisex salons are apparently on the rise, for example, in thesoon-to-be world\u2019s most populous country\u2013India.</p> \n<p>The fact that Estee Lauder, one of the world\u2019stop 3 major players among international beauty companies, decided to launch a unisex salon in India together with its Indian partnerin March 2022is further evidence of the region\u2019s rising demand for unisex salon services.</p> \n<p>As such, beauty salon products packaging featuringsimple black and white, or any monochrome design with no particular gender association can be a perfect manifestation of a gender-inclusive image. For example, thissemi-transparent pump dispenseror thisminimalist airless packaging bottle, similar to those depicted in the picture below:</p> \n<p>The unisex trend also sparked more interest in bigger bottle designs, such as an all-white,big capacity (more than 500ml) pump bottleor otherlarge containersthat can hold up to 1500ml of content and come in unisex colors.</p> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>Fromdrinkware packagingtoecommerce packaging, sustainable packaging has been the new favorite in the packaging industry in recent years, it has evolved into a key trend that is nearly applicable to almost all types of products. The cosmetics and beauty fields are not exempted from this trend. According to theZero Waste Beauty Reportfrom Upcycled Beauty Company, 74% of worldwide consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable packaging in 2022.</p> \n<p>Paris Packaging Week, the largest packaging event for the aerosol, cosmetics, and luxury drinks industry in the world, also placed astrong emphasis on sustainable packaging, with that being the recurring subject covered across the event. And beauty industry experts predict a continuous surge of sustainable packaging, especiallyin Asia.</p> \n<p>In reality, even while certain beauty products are packaged in 100% recyclable materials, such as the kraft paper tubes shown in the image below, the bulk of cosmetics packaging and containers still stick with the use of plastic.</p> \n<p>In order to attain sustainability and to fully materialize reusable packaging, it is therefore imperative to ensure that safely recyclable plastic materials are used. Asqueeze bottle with a push capsuitable for salon usage that is made ofHDPE (high-density polyethylene), for example, is generally recognized as a safe and highly recyclable option.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, atransparent trigger spray bottle with an adjustable nozzlefor flexible hairdresser usage, which is made of PET or sometimes also known as PETE (polyethylene terephthalate) is another well-known safe recyclable choice.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, though the recyclability is not as widely accepted as the two materials above, anLDPE (low-density polyethylene)fine tip applicator with a squeezable containerfor easier hair coloring procedure is still recognized as one of the safe recyclable plastic choices for environmentally friendly goals. Another essential hair coloring tool, thehair coloring applicator brush bottlesthat are made ofPP (polypropylene)also serve as safe alternatives for recycling purposes.</p> \n<h3>Refillable packaging</h3> \n<p>Refillable packaging is in fact a natural progression from sustainable packaging since it provides not only an equally eco-friendly packaging solution but also a step-up effort in extending the shelf life of the package.</p> \n<p>Given these facts, one can predict the wide applications of refillable packaging, particularly for the cosmetics industry, which requires the use of various sizes of containers for many different types of cosmetics packaging, hair care, and skincare products. This is especially true considering the increasing use of sustainable packaging across the board for almost all types of products.</p> \n<p>The popularity and bright prospects of refillable packaging are proven by theproliferation of refill salonslast year and the efforts of globally recognized beauty brands such asL\u2019Oreal and K\u00e9rastaseto continually develop refillable containers and pouches for shampoo and conditioner.</p> \n<p>Small sprayersorlarge mist sprayers, for example, are some of the most widely-used refillable tools in hair salons. These sprayers often come with variants in terms of bottle sizes and functions, such asa refillable sprayer with a long, thin bottle shapeto provide a better grip or a sprayer that supportscontinuous fine mist sprays.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, refillable packaging for shampoo and lotion is another popular container choice for beauty salons. These refillable bottles also come in different shapes and sizes. For instance, on top of the commonly seenrefillable packaging with round, thick bottles, similar to the ones featured in the picture below, one may also opt forlarge, square-shaped refillablebeauty ingredient dispensers or this transparent, long, and thinrefillable pump bottle.</p> \n<h2>A fine blend</h2> \n<p>Much like the packaging of most other products, packaging for beauty salon products is indispensable to guarantee the hygiene of the packaged content. In line with greater disposable income and demands for personal care products, several forecasts demonstrated consistent growth in the global beauty salon services and cosmetic packaging sectors over the next few years. It is therefore beneficial for wholesalers to learn about the most popular types of packaging for beauty salons in order to create a well-balanced mix of packaging styles for their target markets. Three beauty salon packaging trends that will dominate include gender-inclusive packaging, sustainable packaging as well as refillable packaging.

This article explains the latest trends in packaging materials.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsEnvironmental concerns of packaging materialsTrends in packaging materialsConclusion</p> \n<h2>Environmental concerns of packaging materials</h2> \n<p>Customers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of packaging and are demanding more environmentally sustainable options. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, packaging materials make up a significant portion of solid waste at28.1% of the total waste generationin 2018, amounting to 82.2 million tons.</p> \n<p>Packaging materials waste is a major contributor to environmental degradation, with most of the waste ending up in landfills and the ocean. As a result, packaging manufacturers are exploring new sustainable materials and designs to reduce waste to curb this negative trend.</p> \n<p>Some of the most popular environmentally friendly packaging materials include recycled paper, biodegradable plastics, and plant-based materials such as bamboo, cornstarch, and sugarcane. These materials are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and also can be produced at scale.</p> \n<p>Recycled paper-based packaging materials are the most popular eco-friendly packaging as they are made from recycled materials and are easily recyclable. Moreover, they have a lower carbon footprint than plastic packaging materials as they require less energy to produce.</p> \n<p>Another option for eco-friendly packaging materials is biodegradable plastics. They break down over time and do not contribute to environmental plastic pollution. According toBBC Science Focus, biodegradable plastics take at least three to six months to decompose compared to traditional plastics, which could take hundreds of years. The time it takes for biodegradable plastics to break down depends on the temperature and moisture presence.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, using biodegradable plastics comes with challenges as the materials often need specialized disposal methods, which can negatively impact the soil and water quality.</p> \n<p>Plant-based materials like bamboo and cornstarch, also known as bioplastics, are steadily gaining popularity for sustainability packaging. This is because they have a lower carbon footprint and are more renewable and biodegradable than traditional materials.</p> \n<p>One of the most popular bamboo packaging options is thebulk bamboo box. They are handmade, wooden, and compostable. One can order one piece, they have a lead time of 25 days for 1 to 100 pieces, and you can customize them with the company logo for a minimum order of 500 boxes.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, bioplastics are a versatile packaging option that can be used in retail andfood packaging.</p> \n<p>Bioplastics are also noteworthy as they produce carbon dioxide as they decompose. This is because they give off the carbon locked in by the plant matter that made them. As a result bioplastics have almost zero effect on the environment.</p> \n<h3>Pros and cons of these materials:</h3> \n<p>There are many advantages of using eco-friendly materials. However, there are also some concerns with these materials:</p> \n<h2>Trends in packaging materials</h2> \n<p>Many new trends are emerging in packaging materials in addition to a preference for environmentally friendly materials.

In addition, it allows the consumer to develop a relationship with the product.</p> \n<p>Interactive packaging has many benefits for a brand as it enables the product label and packaging design to give consumers valuable information. In addition, it is a creative way to interact with the consumer, nurture a strong relationship with them and create memorable experiences.</p> \n<p>For instance, interactive packaging can be equipped with QR codes that the consumer can scan to get more information on the product and the brand. It can show the quality of the product, its origin, and its authenticity.</p> \n<h3>Modular design</h3> \n<p>This is another emerging trend in packaging materials. It allows companies to customize and create adaptable packaging materials. The principle of modular design is creating an overall design in which a product is broken down into smaller components known as modules that execute specific tasks.</p> \n<p>Modular design has two major benefits, standardization, and customization. The company can standardize the system so modules can be simplified and made more economically and reusable.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the modules can easily customize the system to the consumer\u2019s needs by selecting only those most appropriate for their varying blends and configurations.</p> \n<p>Additionally, modular design allows the company to design processes that respond to changing consumer needs rapidly and more cost-effectively by optimizing the use of materials.</p> \n<h3>Minimalism</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, less is more. Minimalist packaging is when one uses simple and elegant packaging materials. In this era of advertisement, some consumers are looking for simple packaging designs that do not overwhelm them with information.</p> \n<p>Minimalist packaging helps the information on the package stand out so the consumers get it. Additionally, the information is less cluttered and easy for the consumer to digest. Getting your brand message out with the least information will have a greater impact.</p> \n<p>A popular minimalist packaging is thenatural minimalist custom logo shipping box.

The most popular sizes are FEA 13, FEA 15, FEA 18, and FEA 20. For example, FEA 15, means the cap inner diameter and the bottle outer neck diameter (i.e., the bottle neck finish) are both 15mm.</p> \n<h3>ABS</h3> \n<p>ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) capis very good for heat and water resistance, dimensional stability, and impact resistance of PC resin. It is generally opaque, light ivory, non-toxic, tasteless, and hard to break. ABS perfume caps can be customized in different colors or shapes. It is highly adaptable and it can be UV-treated and transfer printed as well.</p> \n<h3>Acrylic</h3> \n<p>Acrylicis also known as PMMA or plexiglass cap. It is high in transparency, chemical stability, and weather resistance. It is easy to process and has a beautiful appearance. It is very popular in the cosmetic industry. To decorate acrylic perfume caps, they can be sandblasted, silk screen printed, transfer printed, hot stamped, or laser engraved. They can also be printed and coated.</p> \n<h3>Wood</h3> \n<p>Wooden capscan either be real wood or assembled with PP. They can be painted with different colors, and shaped into squares, rectangles or cylinders. They can also come with a laser groove to make a brand logo or name. Thewooden capalso gives the perfume the feeling of being natural, pure, and expensive.</p> \n<p>The PP (polypropylene) capis the best for alcohol resistance. It will not crack when exposed to perfume or alcohol. It also has the best heat resistance. It can tolerate temperatures of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius and can even be boiled in water. For decoration or treatment, UV, printing, and transfer printing are all good to go.</p> \n<h3>Aluminum</h3> \n<p>Aluminum capsare a new trend and are getting very popular really quickly. This is because they are more environmentally friendly, and cost-saving while they have a high coating efficiency and wide application.

The most common capacities are 30ml, 50ml, and 100ml, especially because they can be hand carried in airplanes, making it easier to sell in duty-free shops within airport-restricted areas.</p> \n<p>For the material of perfume bottles, there are mainly two types:glassbottles and plastic bottles.Glass bottlesare environmentally friendly, and look more expensive, but are heavier in weight. Decoration for glass bottles can be frosting, coating, screen printing, pad printing, transfer printing, hand polish, and fire polish.</p> \n<p>Plastic bottlesare lighter in weight and good for samples and free gifts, as well as for travel-size perfume about 1-10ml.

The design of perfume bottles can be seen as a piece of art, and can be as important as the fragrance inside the bottle. People may buy the perfume for the scent, but they may also buy it just to add the bottle to their collection.</p> \n<h3>Perfume boxes</h3> \n<p>Perfume boxesnot only serve as extra protection for the perfume bottles but are also a significant part of the perfume packaging as they can give a different feel to the product if the design is right. As the box is the first thing your customer will touch right after the purchase, it leaves an impression on how precious and exclusive it is to have the perfume. The box design can also be alluring for people to buy, so high-quality paper boxes are highly recommended. They can be a traditional square or rectangular shape, but alsoround and cylinder shapesare a good option.</p> \n<p>The most commonly used paper boxes for perfume are thetuck top,two piece, andcrash lock bottomtypes.

These types of products are also convenient to take which helps to raise their popularity too.</p> \n<p>In 2022 the global supplements and nutrition packaging market was valued at approximatelyUS $25.35 billion. Between 2023 and 2030 that number is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 4.1%. Production is increasingly focusing on using materials that are difficult to tamper with, are functional, and are made of sustainable materials.</p> \n<h2>5 in-demand health & nutrition packaging types</h2> \n<p>Whether the consumer is shopping in a health store or browsing online retailers, having the right type of packaging is vital for increasing sales and catching the consumer\u2019s attention. Today\u2019s top health and nutrition packaging options include tablet tubes, extra large bottles for protein powder, medicine bottles, gel pouches, and resealable bags.</p> \n<h3>1. Tablet tubes</h3> \n<p>One of the most popular types of health and nutrition packaging on the market today is thetablet tube. Although it\u2019s not suitable for all products, it\u2019s very effective for holding tablets or pills, and in some casestablet tubesare used to hold powder supplements for easy measurement purposes. This tube is predominantly used to hold powdered tablets which can break apart easily and require more durable storage.</p> \n<p>The plastic tube blocks out any sunlight or artificial light from affecting the tablets, and is perfect for traveling with or taking to the gym with its secure lid. The lid is changeable, but the most common types are the pop-off lid and the screw lid to ensure that the contents won\u2019t spill out.

Protein powder bottles</h3> \n<p>Today\u2019s market has seen a very large increase in the number of consumers purchasing powdered supplements, such as protein. This is because the body is able to absorb powder more quickly than other substances and powder can easily be mixed into food or smoothies for consumers who are on the go.</p> \n<p>These types of supplements normally come in larger quantities which is why theextra large bucketis such a popular style of health and nutrition packaging to watch out for.</p> \n<p>Thelarge size of this containermeans that retailers are able to sell large quantities of any type of powder in a durable and secure form of packaging.

These types of bottles have the same structure as the regular ones, with the only difference being the attractiveness of the outside.</p> \n<h3>4. Gel pouches</h3> \n<p>A big trend to hit the fitness market in recent years is the use of energy gels. Unlike powders or pill supplements, energy gels are used as a quick way to restore lost energy during a workout, so they are designed to work almost immediately after consumption. This type of product isn\u2019t suitable for storing in a medicine bottle or plastic tube, which is why thegel pouchis such an effective form of packaging to use.</p> \n<p>Thegel pouchis designed to contain a single dose or serving of the energy gel, so the consumer doesn\u2019t need to worry about measuring the quantity. The plastic material that it\u2019s made of ensures that no damage will come to the gel inside, and the opening is normally one that requires the consumer to tear off a corner or twist part of the packaging to gain access to the contents.</p> \n<p>Thegel pouchcan also be used to hold other food items such as baby food, which is why it\u2019s such a versatile type of packaging to use in many industries.</p> \n<h3>5.

In the world of fitness, theresealable bagis ideal for holding whey protein powders and other powdered supplements.</p> \n<p>The zippered closure means that the product inside the bag won\u2019t be affected by outside elements and will maintain its freshness, and at the same time the large opening of the bags makes it very easy for the consumer to scoop out the contents.</p> \n<p>These types of bags are also being heavily used for health foods as well, such as flaxseed and protein pancakes.Resealable bagsare now being made ofbiodegradable materialsrather than plastic in order to cut down on wastage and to appeal to the modern consumer who is more likely to be living an eco-conscious lifestyle.</p> \n<h2>What comes next?</h2> \n<p>The health and nutrition packaging market has seen some changes in recent years as a result of different workout regimes and healthy lifestyle patterns that consumers are going through.</p> \n<p>However that doesn\u2019t mean that the traditional type of packaging that consumers have become so accustomed to have completely disappeared. The latest trends to look out for cover plastic tablet tubes, protein powder bottles, medicine bottles, gel pouches, and resealable bags.</p> \n<p>Like most types of packaging, the health and nutrition industry is leaning toward incorporating sustainable materials into their packaging.

Paper packages are affordable compared to other forms and can be tailored specifically to product-specific needs.</p> \n<p>Aesthetics are an essential factor to consider when designingpaper packages for sportswear. For instance, luxury sports apparel often opts for modern and elegant packaging. The graphic elements are simple and appeal to the taste of the target customers.</p> \n<p>Given how paper packages are lightweight and flexible, more fitness brands are utilizing them to pack their products. It is up to the sellers to understand the current market preferences and stock sportswear packages that meet this criterion.</p> \n<p>Paper boxesare a classic example of crowd-favorite sports apparel packaging. These boxes can hold multiple rolled-up items, like a complete tracksuit, making them ideal for selling paired items.</p> \n<h3>3. Bold patterns</h3> \n<p>After years of muted tones, brash colors are making an emphatic comeback. Perhaps this is why 2024 is anticipated to be a fun year for the packaging industry. So dust off your brightest hues!</p> \n<p>The pendulum has swung back in favor of vibrant shades. Apparel brands will continue attracting customers witheye-catching packagingand labels.</p> \n<p>Minimalistic designs, bright colors, creative use of inks, and unique finishes will rock the packaging world. Custom holography or high-shine effects are proven to grab the most eyeballs. They are all set to become increasingly popular as they look to make a splash amongst the competition.</p> \n<p>Further, sportswear companies aim to create a sense of vitality and excitement.Neon colorsand funky pop of shades on the packaging are the best way to do so.</p> \n<h3>4. Customized fabric bags</h3> \n<p>Sportswear packaging has reached a new level of sophistication withcustomized fabric bags. With airtight seals and zippers for maximum protection, these lightweight packages offer the perfect solution. They can keep items safe during transportation or storage without taking up too much space.</p> \n<p>Fabric bags are especially suited for thinner materials such as sports underwear andleggings. Plus, they can easily be customized according to brands\u2019 needs. Not only this, but their eco-friendly nature is sure to meet customers\u2019 demands for sustainable shopping experiences.</p> \n<p>Retailers have shown a liking towards fabric bags for sports as they are affordable and enhance the lifespan of clothes. Their travel-friendly nature allows buyers to carry the bags around without much hassle.</p> \n<h3>5. Compostable packages</h3> \n<p>In the quest to become more sustainable, a recent trend of compostable orbiodegradable packaginghas emerged as an alternative solution. This packaging material for sportswear reduces waste and pollution, but it also provides another use once its original purpose is complete \u2014 gardening!</p> \n<p>Plastic products can remain intact long after their disposal. Eventually, these materials can end up in places they don\u2019t belong, like beaches.</p> \n<p>To combat this problem, some retailers are now providing packages with embedded flower seeds that grow into plants once discarded into the garden. It is meant to provide an eco-friendly second life for those pieces of polluting material while increasing biodiversity at home.</p> \n<p>Compostable bags with double-sided tape bandsare another variant of packages available for sports apparel companies. Even though they have limited space, they work best for accessories and lightweight items.</p> \n<h2>Key takeaway: sustainability is the way to go!</h2> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly taking note of environmental issues and making purchasing decisions that reflect their values. Sustainability has become a necessity for businesses dealing in activewear packaging.</p> \n<p>Shoppers seek to know not only what products they are buying but where they came from. They are willing to know how green the production process is. And so it is clear \u2013 when shopping today, consumers want the full story of each product before deciding whether or not to buy.</p> \n<p>As businesses and consumers become more conscious of their environmental impact, the packaging industry is following suit with a shift toward sustainable materials. Expect to see an increased use of recycled items that can be reused or biodegradable components when making future purchases.</p> \n<p>The market for sportswear packaging is undergoing significant changes, and the stakeholders must keep an eye on trends to maintain their competitive edge.</p> \n"}]}

Therefore, selecting packaging materials that balance price and quality is critical.

However, smaller less-expensive products should be wrapped in cheaper but quality paperboard boxes.</p> \n<p>In addition, it is important to consider the convenience of packaging.

An example is the custom folding boxes characterized by tuck flaps at the top and bottom.</p> \n<h3>Safety features and tamper-evident seals</h3> \n<p>Customers often buy products with evident safety features and tamper-evident seals. Therefore, the selected packaging designs should incorporate these features to increase their appeal to target buyers. Examples to consider are packaging products with extra features, such as container seals and shrinking wraps.</p> \n<h3>Environmental friendliness</h3> \n<p>Recent years have seen increased consumer awareness, demand for eco-friendly products, and strict government laws and regulations requiring sustainable packaging practices. Therefore, it is essential to consider paper packaging products that are environmentally friendly such asrecyclable paperboard products.</p> \n<h2>Key market segments to target</h2> \n<p>Before stocking the paper packaging product, it is essential to determine the ideal target customer.

The market shows no sign of slowing down.Global Market Insights(GMI) projects the glass packaging market\u2019s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to increase to over 4.5% from 2023 to 2032.</p> \n<p>As consumers turn tosustainable business practices, they will shift from plastic to glass. The demand for glass packaging is set to rise with environmental awareness. A preference for glass packaging in the pharmaceutical industry and the rising consumption of beer will also propel market growth.</p> \n<h2>4 glass packaging trends to look for</h2> \n<p>Glass offers advantages to businesses across many industries. It continues to gain popularity among sellers because of its durability, as it can be easily shipped and transported worldwide. Here are four of the projected glass packaging trends.</p> \n<h3>1. Alcohol bottles</h3> \n<p>Alcohol accounts for a significant part of the glass packaging industry. Beer on its own is the most consumed beverage globally.GMI projectsthat the beer segment of the alcoholic beverage industry will surpass US $24.5 billion by 2032.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers can customize glassbeer bottlesby size, shape, and color to meet each client\u2019s needs. Consumers associate glass bottles with premium products and pay more for them.</p> \n<p>Apart from beer, experts predict that the alcoholic beverage industry will grow by 4.5% CAGR over the next ten years. Glass represents the overwhelming majority ofwine packaging. Like beer bottles, wine is packaged in round glass bottles that tend to have slight differences in shape, size, and color.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, glassliquor bottlesvary in visual appearance. Manufacturers mold, engrave, frost, and color the bottles to bring out their branding identities.</p> \n<h3>2. Perfume and cologne bottles</h3> \n<p>Glass is the preferred packaging material forperfume and cologne bottles. Scents are difficult to advertise. Consumers need to be physically present to smell a fragrance. Thus, the glass packaging\u2019s visual appearance becomes extremely important for marketing the product.</p> \n<p>Consumers associate well-designed glass bottles with luxury. Sellers can take advantage of this by crafting visually appealing glass packaging.</p> \n<p>Enhancing looks is vital, but the main purpose of glass packaging is protection. In the cosmetics industry, vendors depend on packaging to keep products fresh. Glass packaging stops air from getting in and affecting the contents. Glass also protects against leakage.</p> \n<p>These features benefit other cosmetic products likeskincare bottlesandnail polish containers. Consumers are more likely to make repeat purchases and try out all the newestbeauty trendswhen they are sure of a product\u2019s quality.</p> \n<h3>3. Pharmaceutical vials</h3> \n<p>Increased demand for glass packaging in the pharmaceutical industry is another reason to expect growth. Manufacturers often use borosilicate glass to makepharmaceutical vials. These vials can store substances like blood, plasma, and vaccines. Borosilicate glass vials are ideal for storing substances at low temperatures.</p> \n<p>The glass also does not melt if exposed to everyday heat as opposed to plastic. GMI\u2019s glass packaging market report also predicts that the value of borosilicate glass will surpass US $22 billion by 2032.</p> \n<p>The pharmaceutical industry also uses some types of plastic packaging. However, the industry is shifting from plastic to glass. Glass is more airtight than plastic. It allows for better visibility of substances inside jars and vials.</p> \n<p>Glass also keeps a vial\u2019s contents sterilized and keeps the individual handling the vial safe. Professionals rely on glass packaging across the pharmaceutical industry. Some other examples includemedicine storage containersandeye droppers.</p> \n<h3>4. Candle jars</h3> \n<p>The retail industry has also found many uses for glass to package their products. One common use is to package candles in glasscandle jars.Reports suggestthat the global candle market had a valuation of US $6.8 billion in 2021 and should exceed US $9.9 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6.5% from 2022 to 2028.</p> \n<p>Using glass to package candles offers protection and a look of elegance. After the candle burns away, the jar can be reused as a glass bottlecontaineror recycled.</p> \n<h2>Will glass packaging live up to its potential?</h2> \n<p>Glass is one of the oldest packaging materials and is still going strong. Durability, consumer safety, and appearance continue to help the industry grow. Today society favors recyclable and reusable product packaging, which gives glass another advantage. More companies should consider using glass packaging to grow their businesses.</p> \n"}]}

This article discusses the tips to follow when buying plastic packaging for businesses.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsExpected growth in the plastic packaging industrySelection tips for buying plastic packagingTypes of plastic packagingConclusion</p> \n<h2>Expected growth in the plastic packaging industry</h2> \n<p>The current global market size for plastic packaging is worth $369.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $492.3 billion at a CAGR rate of 4.2% by 2030.</p> \n<p>The reason for the vast market share in the plastic packaging industry is the need to preserve products likefoodsand cosmetics, which are highly-consumed products worldwide. Another reason that is contributing to the large growth of the plastic packaging market is the rise of retail stores that are dependent on plastic packaging products.</p> \n<p>Also, the growing population is a major contributor to the need for the use of plastic material as the main option for packaging products. Plastic is cheaper than other products like wood, metal, or cloth material used for packaging.</p> \n<h2>Selection tips for buying plastic packaging</h2> \n<h3>Compatibility with the product</h3> \n<p>The interaction of the plastic packaging and the product in it is what determines whether they are compatible with each other. A transformation in the shape, texture, smell, taste, or tightness, and the loss of moisture are probable outcomes of packaging and product interaction while a product is in storage.</p> \n<p>Suppliers need to conduct compatibility tests to ensure that the plastic packaging product they stock goes with the right products. For instance, businesses should know whichplastic packagingis well-suited for various food, cosmetic, or electronic products. If the packaging is incompatible with the contents, it may affect the quality and the overall shelf life of the product.</p> \n<h3>Size of the bag</h3> \n<p>Products come in different sizes, weights, and capacities depending on how they are intended to reach the final consumer. Suppliers stocking plastic bags for consumer shopping should have shopping bags available that are made in different sizes. This is so that they can suit people that are buying a few items and those buying in bulk in a retail shop.</p> \n<p>Businesses should offer plastic bags meant for liquid contents in sizes that fit 250ml, 500ml, 1l, 2l, and 5l of contents. This makes it easy for consumers to fit contents of different quantities in plastic bags.</p> \n<p>The same applies to plastic bags for hard solid products like cereals and grains whereby businesses should include bag sizes of 250g, 500g, 1kg, 2kg, 5kg, etc. on their shelves.</p> \n<h3>User-friendly</h3> \n<p>User-friendliness is key when choosing the type of plastic packaging product to be used for certain products.</p> \n<p>For example, plastic bottles for less viscous fluids should be made with a wide body and a narrow neck, while those for viscous fluids can have a wide neck and body. This allows for an easy flow of contents in and out of the packaging.</p> \n<p>Plastic containers should have lids that are also easy to open and close when consumers want to use the products.</p> \n<p>Further, the bottles and containers should include a corkscrew that helps consumers to close them tightly without leaking the contents. The final consumer will be using the product at the end of the day. Businesses should acquire the items that will satisfy the needs of their customers.</p> \n<h3>Brand reflection</h3> \n<p>Plastic containers, bags, bottles, and other kinds of plastic packaging are customizable. Plastic packaging products have stickers that can display the name of a product on the label for differentiation from other products. In addition to the label of the product, the packaging should also help create consumer awareness of the brand.</p> \n<p>Businesses should include packaging that isprintableusing any kind of inkjet printer. They should also include the packaging in different colors for companies that use one color for their clients to easily identify the brand.</p> \n<h3>Value for money</h3> \n<p>Plastic packaging is one of the best inventions. Its production cost is fairer than that of other types of materials for packaging.</p> \n<p>However, plastics are non-biodegradable because they do not rot. Although plastics are not overall good for the environment, in some ways they are beneficial.</p> \n<p>Suppliers can include plastic packaging products that are reusable and recyclable for sale. Additionally, they should add plastic packaging that is tough and lasts a long time.</p> \n<h3>Eco-friendly</h3> \n<p>Businesses should consider recyclable plastic packaging products because many countries are putting restrictions on non-biodegradable plastic products. Accumulation of non-biodegradable plastic waste can alter habitats and natural processes. Substituting single-use plastics for recyclable and reusable bottles, containers and bags, therefore, is a good idea.</p> \n<h2>Types of plastic packaging</h2> \n<h3>Flexible plastic packaging</h3> \n<p>Flexible plastic packaging is made from non-rigid plastic and allows for its shapes to change during use. It can be in the form of bags, wraps, or pouches.

The period between 2020 and 2027 is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4%, which will bring the market value to at least USD 193.24 billion by 2027. A shift away from the use of plastic packaging towards eco-friendly and reusable materials has caused a bigspike in demand for metal packaging, especially metal cans.</p> \n<h2>Top metal packaging trends</h2> \n<p>Metal packaging can come in all shapes and sizes, and although metal cans are heavily used, other styles are starting to gain popularity and are a great alternative to less sustainable packaging. The top metal packaging trends to watch include steel cans, metal canisters, metal boxes, cosmetic tins, aluminum squeeze tubes, and metal gas cylinders.</p> \n<h3>Steel cans</h3> \n<p>When compared to aluminum cans,steel cansare slightly heavier, but with that additional weight comes more durability and safety for the contents inside. They are used interchangeably with tin cans to hold food such as soup or pasta, but thestainless steel materialis also perfect for holding liquids such as cooking oils with its useful screw cap and double-lined interior to ensure longevity and no leakage. Steel cans have also started to beused to store vodkaand other spirits as steel is much more durable than glass when being transported and stored.</p> \n<p>Outside of the food and beverage sector, steel cans are very popular in the automotive industry for storing oil and other flammable liquids.Paint cansare also known to be made of steel and, with more consumers spending their income on home improvements, the demand for metal packaging in this industry is growing at a steady pace.</p> \n<h3>Metal canisters</h3> \n<p>In recent years,metal canistershave become one of the most sought-after types of metal packaging in the market. This airtight container is built to protect its contents from outside conditions in order to keep the interior dry.

It\u2019s a timeless piece of packaging that consumers love to purchase because, like the metal canister, it can easily be reused or restocked when it\u2019s empty. This is a popular type of packaging for food items such as cookies and other sweet treats, especially if the box has a beautiful design on it to attract potential buyers.</p> \n<p>Aside from cookies though, metal boxes have a lot of other uses. Having ahinged lidincorporated into themetal boxmakes it ideal for the cosmetic and beauty industry as the contents will not only be kept safe but will also be easy to access. Even the fishing industry uses metal boxes to holdfishing luresand other accessories. This is one metal packaging trend that can be found across numerous industries around the globe.</p> \n<h3>Cosmetic tins</h3> \n<p>As demand for metal packaging continues to increase, the market has seen a rise in demand from the cosmetic industry.Cosmetic tinsare proving to be a great alternative to plastic containers to hold powders, lip balm, and other types of makeup.Eyeshadow paletteswith colorful designs are also beginning to be manufactured using tin rather than other materials as the industry looks to create less waste and be more sustainable.</p> \n<p>Thesmaller-sized cosmetic tinsare also ideal for companies who want to send samples to potential consumers as they\u2019re lightweight and will hold just enough inside to peak interest in a product. After the tins have been used for their original purpose, they can store other small household items, such as pins or paperclips, and even work well to store gum or herbs for cooking.</p> \n<h3>Aluminum squeeze tubes</h3> \n<p>Metal packaging isn\u2019t necessarily known for its flexibility, but thealuminum squeeze tubeis the exception. This type of metal packaging is especially popular with creams, ointments, toothpaste, and even liquid makeup. It often comes in a small size to make it portable and can be fully recycled after use.</p> \n<p>Thesqueeze tubeis made of a thinaluminum materialthat\u2019s completely airtight, and the nozzle at the top can have various designs depending on the need of the seller, but it often comes in the form of a twist cap. Many consumers are now focused on taking more personal hygiene measures, so sanitizers and sanitizing creams are often found in this type of packaging as well.</p> \n<h3>Metal gas cylinders</h3> \n<p>Gas cylinders are most commonly used for holding oxygen and nitrous oxide, and they\u2019re popular across a number of industries that require safe and reliable storage.

The top metal packaging trends include steel cans, metal canisters, metal boxes, cosmetic tins, aluminum squeeze tubes, and metal gas cylinders.</p> \n<p>Many countries around the world have a good recycling policy in place, which means any type of metal packaging can be repurposed after use.

Packaging combines materials, colors, themes, texts, and other design components to project a brand\u2019s values and connect with consumers.</p> \n<p>In addition, product packaging is an excellent way to inform clients, raise their expectations and then meet those expectations. For this reason, it\u2019s an important aspect that demands a retailer\u2019s attention. This article explains the factors to consider when creating packaging for products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow big is the product packaging market?Five things to consider before selecting product packagingFinishing thoughts</p> \n<h2>How big is the product packaging market?</h2> \n<p>Product packaging is a massive sector of the global economy driven by the desire to make life more convenient. It includes marketing initiatives, research and design processes, and technology for making products available to consumers.</p> \n<p>According to Smithers, the global packaging market increased from $843.8 billion to $914.7 billion between 2015 and 2019. Further, it\u2019s projected to reach$1.13 trillion by 2030.</p> \n<p>The fast-moving consumer goods industry continues to see a rise in businesses increasing their reach globally and becoming digitalized.</p> \n<p>Consumers are primarily interested in packaging that simplifies their lives. Younger age groups are particularly inclined to shop for groceries more frequently and in smaller quantities due to the shift to single-person living. This has increased demand for more practical, smaller-sized formats and fueled growth in the convenience store retailing sector.</p> \n<p>The switch from high-volume, single-use items that generate waste to alternative materials presents businesses with better ways to connect with their audience. The movement pushes brands to create and invest in plant-based plastics while adopting and recycling enhanced waste processes to demonstrate their environmental commitment.</p> \n<p>Still, the demand for plastic packaging remains high as more people consume food, beverages, medicines, and similar goods on the go. Other factors expected to influence this rapidly expanding market over the coming years include technological advances, regional patterns, trends in end-use products, and the dynamic brand and retailer landscapes.</p> \n<h2>Five things to consider before selecting product packaging</h2> \n<h3>Available capital</h3> \n<p>How much would it cost? How much is available? These questions pertain to the actual packaging, the design process, and distribution costs. The available capital significantly determines what businesses can and can\u2019t do. Weighing the costs and defining the spending limit can help guide the selection process.</p> \n<p>While factors like design work and printing are one-time costs, materials & labor are per-time expenditures. Somepackaging materialscan be costly depending on the product type or industry. Also, the cost of custom packaging is difficult to determine as individual preferences can vary widely.</p> \n<p>Investing a little bit more in packaging development could help increase visibility and improve the products\u2019 presentation and selling price. Consumers don\u2019t mind paying extra forpremium packaging.</p> \n<p>However, remember that expensive doesn\u2019t always mean high quality, and cheaper isn\u2019t always worse. So, optimize available capital by going for cost-effective and convenient options. It makes packaging and shipping a lot easier and saves money on packaging expenses.</p> \n<h3>Transport medium</h3> \n<p>Another factor to consider is the lifecycle of the products. Businesses must ask a few questions: How will the products get to the consumer? Will they be sold online and shipped? Or will they be displayed in retail stores? More importantly, will they move to the final destination by air or road?</p> \n<p>All these factors affect the package\u2019s condition before it reaches the final consumer. Although aesthetically pleasing packages are excellent, goods must get to the buyers intact. This is the primary reason forpackaging.</p> \n<p>Consumers don\u2019t want to find broken contents when openingtheir packages. It\u2019s a massive loss for both parties if the product gets damaged during distribution. For this reason, a product\u2019s packaging must be conducive to the transport medium, ensuring it stays intact.</p> \n<h3>Packaging sustainability and materials</h3> \n<p>Eco-friendly materials are fast becoming a leading concern to consumers. However, this largely depends on the product sold and the brand\u2019s style.</p> \n<p>Paper packaging is eco-friendly and offers several customization options, but it\u2019s better suited for dry goods. Liquids and food items require special packaging. Plastic or metal is ideal for products with longer shelf lives.</p> \n<p>While brands should consider ways to make packaging more sustainable, understanding the differences between various options is critical. Sustainable materials may cost more, but they\u2019re worth investing in.</p> \n<p>Ideally, the material of choice should naturally flow into the brand\u2019s production cycle. It should also be compatible with the equipment used in packaging and every storage and distribution medium. And it must be durable enough to withstand all these processes.</p> \n<p>In addition, the product\u2019s size and weight will determine the perfect packaging material. Heavy or fragile products will need durable materials likecorrugated boxes, while paper or poly bags will suffice for lightweight products. Glass or ceramic products may requireinserts or fillingsfor added security.</p> \n<p>Although capital is a significant determinant, it\u2019s not an excuse to use low-quality or inappropriate materials. Businesses must strike a balance between costs and quality as choosing premium materials may save costs in the long run.</p> \n<p>Considering package sustainability and materials will help prevent pitfalls like product recall or refunds that negatively impact the brand\u2019s finances and reputation.</p> \n<h3>Packaging size</h3> \n<p>A package\u2019s size must be proportionate to the product inside it. Packaging for small and large items differs significantly. Consumers find large containers with tiny contents annoying. Also, businesses withprecise-size packagingwill use lesser resources and limit the damage.</p> \n<p>Products sold online and shipped shouldn\u2019t have packaging with a lot of space. The extra space may scatter the product\u2019s arrangement or lead to unwanted damage during transport. It\u2019s recommended that products moving from one point to another have packages that fit their sizes.</p> \n<p>Product sizealso determines if businesses can use pre-made or custom packaging options. Alternatively, businesses with multiple product sizes can select two sizes that work for all.</p> \n<h3>Branding and design</h3> \n<p>A brand\u2019s product presentation is the primary point of contact with its target audience, and it determines the final results of the buying process. Ideally,the packagingmust draw customers\u2019 attention, communicate a message, and persuade them to purchase the product.</p> \n<p>A well-designed package informs buyers about the brand\u2019s values and also attests to the integrity of the product it contains.</p> \n<p>Identifying the target market before beginning the packaging design is crucial in developing the packaging plan.</p> \n<p>Every packaging design element, including the components and color schemes, must reflect the contents and the brand. While older target customers may require enlarged text, beauty products will requireattractive packaging. Also, green and brown colors work wonders for nature-focused products.</p> \n<p>Also, work at creating an unboxing experience that delights and excites. Customers place a high value on useful and practical packaging. Therefore, select materials that are user-friendly for easy opening.</p> \n<h2>Finishing thoughts</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s incredible what effective packaging can do for businesses. It\u2019s an opportunity for businesses to connect with their target audience and reinforce their brand.</p> \n<p>Companies can benefit from the influence ofpackaging for productsif they weigh the costs, factor in transportation & distribution, choose durable, eco-friendly, high-quality materials, and use the right-sized packaging.</p> \n"}]}

Instead of using above forty pounds of glass to transport beverages or more, businesses can get the job done with two pounds of plastic.</p> \n<p>The difference is clear! And brands can save costs by investing in plastic. Here are five notable plasticpackaging trendsto consider.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the plastic packaging market6 plastic packaging trends changing the marketFinal words</p> \n<h2>An overview of the plastic packaging market</h2> \n<p>The last few decades have witnessed a sharp rise in the use of plastic globally. According to research, experts estimate the world\u2019s plastic use to be460 million metric tons. Interestingly, the packaging industry holds the dominant position, accounting for over 31% of the total estimate.</p> \n<p>Plastics can pack almost anything, including liquids, powders, solids, and semi-solids. For this reason, various industries prefer them over other alternatives like paper, metal, and glass.</p> \n<p>As demands for fresh foods, perishable goods, and other similar products keep increasing, retailers are adopting more organized, lightweight, and flexible packaging options. For this reason, the plastics segment enjoys a steady expansion rate.</p> \n<p>Despite the increasing concerns about the environmental hazards of plastic packaging, the market still presents an effective way to secure goods during dispatch. Regardless, traditional packaging may replace plastics if the recycling rates do not improve.</p> \n<p>In 2021, experts value the plastic packaging market at$355 billion. They expect the industry to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% CAGR from 2022 to 2030. Also, the global sustainable plastic packaging market is projected to reach almost$130 billionby 2026, showing that bioplastics will significantly impact the plastic packaging market.</p> \n<p>Thus, businesses should adopt these innovations to increase their penetration in respective industries and meet the needs of their consumers while reducing waste.</p> \n<h2>6 plastic packaging trends changing the market</h2> \n<h3>Biodegradable plastic packaging</h3> \n<p>Biodegradable plastic is slowly taking over the packaging market as more retailers shift toward eco-friendly solutions. This synthetic compound can decompose over time through biological means and turn into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass.</p> \n<p>This unique polymer\u2019s ability to degrade naturally gives it an edge over other plastics, making it one of the best options for packaging. Some types include polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose-based plastics, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and plant starch blends.</p> \n<p>It only takes between three to six months for biodegradable plastics to decompose\u2014with constant exposure to light or oxygen. In contrast, it takes regular polymers about a thousand years to reach the same level of degradation.</p> \n<p>Although biodegradable plastics can replace conventional polymers in every category, their higher costs prevent most businesses from swapping packaging.</p> \n<p>Regardless, biodegradable polymers are widespread infood packaging. Some common examples include carry-out bags,takeout containers, and coffee cups.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also invest inbiodegradable plastic bags. Manufacturers often use these synthetic polymers to create shopping bags, packaging, and other single-use bags.</p> \n<h3>Polypropylene (PP) plastic</h3> \n<p>Polypropylene is a tough, rigid, crystalline thermoplastic made from propene monomer. Although it is slightly hard, polypropylene is one of the lightest thermoplastics. Plus, it offers low density, high heat resistance, and water-repellent properties.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers use various techniques to make polypropylene. They can make the plastic neat, reinforced with natural fibers, or with short and long glass fibers. Other techniques include blow molding and sheet thermoforming.</p> \n<p>PP is ideal formany packagingapplications due to its superior optical clarity, low moisture-vapor transmission, good barrier properties, high strength, good surface finish, and affordability. Businesses can use it for products in food, health, personal care, medical and labware categories. Interestingly, they can usepolypropyleneto package many other products.</p> \n<p>Although it is completely recyclable and has good chemical resistance, polypropylene is susceptible to attack from highly oxidizing solvents and microbes.</p> \n<p>Polypropylene plastic works especially well in the food industry. It can be used for food-grade containers like medicine bottles, yogurt cups, and margarine tubs.</p> \n<h3>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic</h3> \n<p>Polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or vinyl, is the third-largest thermoplastic substance in the world by volume, next to polyethylene and polypropylene. It is a solid and brittle substance that comes in granules or powder form.</p> \n<p>Additionally, PVC is lightweight, cost-effective, and highly adaptable, allowing businesses topackage productswithout fear. Interestingly,polyvinyl chloride packagingis resistant to biological and chemical damage.</p> \n<p>Although PVC is mostly flexible or rigid, businesses can purchase other types like chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), molecular-oriented PVC, and modified variants (usually designed for specific applications).</p> \n<p>Businesses can use PVC plastic packaging for tamper-proof medications, clamshells, heavy-duty packaging bags, and shrink wrapping.</p> \n<p>PVC is the least eco-friendly plastic packaging material as residual matters are toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. However, it makes excellent building and construction materials after recycling.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, retailers can use PVC films as stretch and shrink wraps for consumer and industrial goods. They may also work as pallet wraps.</p> \n<h3>High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic</h3> \n<p>High-density polyethylene, or HDPE, is a very versatile plastic with many applications\u2014from making pipes to storage bottles. It is also well-known for its exceptional tensile strength and high strength-to-density ratio.</p> \n<p>In addition, HDPE\u2019s high malleability makes it one of the mostpliable plasticmaterials available. Most manufacturers use it to make milk jugs, shampoo bottles, cutting boards, and other plastic bottles.</p> \n<p>Its rigid strength, corrosion- and impact- resistance, and high melting point make it excellent for underground piping. HDPE also makes sturdy containers for solvents, acids, cleaning agents, and a majority of chemicals.</p> \n<p>HDPE is an effective alternative toheavier packaging materialsand is suitable for businesses looking for strength and environmental-friendliness in one plastic package.</p> \n<p>The most common use for HDPE plastic is storage bottle production. These bottles can host several liquids, including milk, conditioners, motor oil, bleaches, and shampoos.</p> \n<h3>Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) plastic</h3> \n<p>Polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PETE, or PET, is incredibly popular for producing beverage bottles. The plastic features unrivaled clarity, strength, and high moisture-gas barrier quality. Moreover, PET plastic is impact resistant.</p> \n<p>Thislightweight plasticdoes not react to food or drinks and is immune to attacks from microorganisms. PETE will not deteriorate biologically like glass but is shatterproof and more transportable.</p> \n<p>Businesses can use PET plastics to package drinks, water, salad dressings, ketchup, and other liquid or semi-liquid products. Some solid products are also compatible with PETE plastic packaging.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more? The FDA approved PETE plastic for food contact, and it is highly sustainable and fully recyclable. However, the plastic has low impact strength and is weak to damage from heat and strong chemicals.</p> \n<p>PET plastics can create bags for packaging cosmetics and other personal care products. Plus, retailers can easily customize their packages with prints and images. Sellers can also use PET plastic packaging for baked goods.</p> \n<h3>Water-soluble plastic</h3> \n<p>Another example of a great biodegradable polymer is water-soluble plastic. As the name implies, this synthetic blend decomposes quickly when it contacts boiling water.</p> \n<p>Made without toxic heavy metals, water-soluble plastics work like wrapping films present on laundry tablets or dishwashers. Currently, this biodegradable plastic is making waves in the apparel industry as many manufacturers use it to craft highly-effectivegarment bags.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Plastic packaging provides an excellent way to store products before they reach the final consumer. Businesses can cut down costs and secure their goods by using various plastic packaging trends.</p> \n<p>Biodegradable plastic, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, high-density polyethylene, water-soluble plastic, and polyethylene terephthalate are the plastic packaging trends to focus on.</p> \n"}]}

More importantly, it\u2019s easy to customize these packaging options.</p> \n<p>In addition,boxboard cartonsare incredibly lightweight and affordable. However, they don\u2019t have impressive structural strength and won\u2019t be ideal for products requiring supportive or durable packaging.</p> \n<p>Businesses can purchase different boxboard types for their product lines. Some of the best include folding, rigid, and set-up cartons.</p> \n<p>While set-up cartons come disassembled, folding variants arrive flat and pre-assembled. Also, most sellers utilize rigid cartons for slightly heavy products. Interestingly, cereals, cosmetics, and detergents are popular products packaged in these boxes.</p> \n<p>Boxboards make smaller boxes for cosmetics, food, and consumer goods. They\u2019re great alternatives for packages that don\u2019t need the strength of corrugated boxes. These foldable cartons can also satisfy high print needs and make paper cups & plates.</p> \n<h3>Corrugated boxes</h3> \n<p>Corrugated boxesare like Supermen of the paper packaging world. They are incredibly durable and can handle the weight of heavy goods. Usually, manufacturers make them from corrugated fiberboards, which have two exterior paper layers and an internal wavy layer.</p> \n<p>Corrugated boxes offer enough thickness to store and ship heavy goods without problems. However, businesses must understand the different types ofcorrugated boxes. While single-wall corrugated boxes can only handle lightweight objects, double-wall variants can handle larger products.</p> \n<p>Triple-wall corrugated boxes offer the highest strength and can withstand hefty objects.

Food & beverage, cosmetic, medicine, and chemical industries are some of the common sectors that are highly dependent on glass packaging to store products.</p> \n<p>Choosing the ideal type of glass packaging suitable for your business can be a challenging task. This guide discusses the tips to make your glass packaging buying process easy.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsGlass packaging market overviewSelection tips for buying glass packagingTypes of glass packagingConclusion</p> \n<h2>Glass packaging market overview</h2> \n<p>In 2022, the global market size for glass packaging was valued at$55.5 billionand is projected to reach a valuation of $88.3 billion by 2032 at a CAGR of 4.5%.</p> \n<p>The main drivers for the huge growth in the market size for glass packaging are the global increase in the consumption of beer and a large demand for glass packaging in the pharmaceutical industry.</p> \n<p>Another contributor is an increase in the consumption of packaged food leading to high market demand forglass packagingproducts in the food & beverage industry.</p> \n<h2>Selection tips for buying glass packaging</h2> \n<p>Although buying glass packaging may seem easy, there is a process to make it effortless. The following are some tips businesses should follow when buying glass packaging.</p> \n<h3>Determine the purpose of the packaging</h3> \n<p>As we have seen, glass packaging is applied in many industries, and the type of glass packaging in one sector may not be the same as the one for use in another. For instance, businesses serving customers in the food & beverage industries do not use the same type of glass packaging as pharmaceutical businesses.</p> \n<p>If the packaging is for beer companies, businesses should buy dark-colored bottles. Dark bottles assist in keeping the alcohol for a long time without spoiling.</p> \n<p>Other industries such as beauty product manufacturers, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals should acquire the rightglass packagingto suit their purpose correctly.</p> \n<h3>Consider the size and shape of the packaging</h3> \n<p>Products take different shapes as they roll out of the production line in a factory. The products will also either be huge or small as intended for the final consumer. The glass packaging should therefore have the right dimensions to fit the needs of different consumers.</p> \n<p>For instance, businesses selling glass bottles should stock them in different capacities such ashalf a liter, three-quarter liter, or 1 liter to fit in contents appropriately. The shape of these bottles should feature a narrow opening for thick fluids and a narrow opening for liquids that flow easily.</p> \n<p>Glass jars to fit in solid products should also come in different sizes such as 100 grams, 500 grams, or 1 kilogram. The jars should have a wide opening to allow easy consumption and refilling of contents.</p> \n<h3>Choose the right type of glass</h3> \n<p>To favor different packaging needs, different types of glass with varying properties are used for different products. Depending on the type of glass, some packaging products offer more advantages than others. The types of glass available include type III, type II, and type I.</p> \n<p>Type III glass or soda lime glass is less resistant to chemicals and water. It is therefore suitable for most food beverage and pharmaceutical packaging.</p> \n<p>Type II glass, also called treated soda-lime glass, is type III glass that has been treated for use in acidic chemicals. The treatment of the glass helps the packaging products attain chemical, water, friction, breakage, and UV light resistance. Type II glass is suitable for other uses beyond acidic applications.</p> \n<p>Type I glass, which is known as borosilicate glass or Pyrex, has a high resistance to heat and chemicals. This glass type is most common for packaging laboratory chemicals. Type I glass is durable and works best for all types of applications.</p> \n<h3>Think about the design of the packaging</h3> \n<p>Diverse packaging designs play a major role in differentiating one type of product from another. For instance, the type of glass jar for packing coffee granules is not the same as the one used for a salt shaker.</p> \n<p>Special designs also make it easy to tell apart different brands. Some brands are mostly identifiable because of the type of packaging that houses the product.</p> \n<p>Businesses should therefore consider stocking glass bottles and jars with unique designs to suit specific products as well as the tastes and preferences of consumers.</p> \n<h3>Consider the cost</h3> \n<p>The cost is also among the core factors when buying glass packaging as prices vary widely. Expensive glass packaging tends to offer better quality than cheaper glass packaging.</p> \n<p>However, as that is not always the case, it is important to ascertain the quality of the glass packaging before going ahead and paying more for low-grade products.</p> \n<h2>Types of glass packaging</h2> \n<p>Here are five varieties of glass packaging available in the market:</p> \n<h3>Borosilicate glass</h3> \n<p>Borosilicate glass is also known as Pyrex. It contains a high amount of boric oxide, aluminum oxide, and alkaline earth oxide. It has the best resistance to water, heat, thermal shock, and most chemicals. Also, it is thebest glassavailable since it works best for acidic, neutral, and alkaline substances.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Can be used for most applications\u2013 Is highly durable</p> \n<p>\u2013 Is more expensive than regular glass\u2013 Can be scratched easily</p> \n<h3>Soda-lime glass</h3> \n<p>This is a silica glass that has medium chemical and water resistance. It is cheap and can be recycled many times. It is ideal for food & beverages and medical packaging.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Is inexpensive\u2013 Can be recycled</p> \n<p>\u2013 Is not resistant to thermal shock\u2013 Is not ideal for chemicals</p> \n<h3>Tempered glass</h3> \n<p>Tempered glass is regular glass heated at high temperatures and cooled rapidly. When the glass breaks, it shatters into small cubes.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Does not break but shatters\u2013 Is stronger than conventional glass</p> \n<p>\u2013 Cannot be repaired when broken\u2013 Cannot be cut or processed after the tempering process</p> \n<h3>Laminated glass</h3> \n<p>It comprises two or more glass pieces joined together using vinyl or plastic with the application of heat.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Sticks to the plastic when broken\u2013 Is UV resistant</p> \n<p>\u2013 It is expensive because of the number of materials used in the lamination process.</p> \n<h3>Biophotonic glass</h3> \n<p>This glass type, which is also called violet glass, is deeply colored and can block light. It is suitable forcosmeticpackaging because it protects the contents from sunlight hence giving them a long shelf life.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Drinking from a biophotonic bottle brings health benefits\u2013 Protects against decomposition</p> \n<p>\u2013 Is not suitable for food packaging\u2013 Can be more expensive than regular glass</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Glass has many advantages when it comes to offering a packaging option. There are also various types of glass to choose from. Businesses should acquire different types of glass packaging to suit the needs of many customers.

The agriculture industry must find more efficient ways to produce and package food to meet this demand. Here are eightpackaging productsin the agriculture industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket overview for agriculture packaging8 packaging for agriculture productsConclusion</p> \n<h2>Market overview for agriculture packaging</h2> \n<p>According to the Blue Weave Consulting, the current global market size for agriculture packaging products is valued atUS $5.36 billion. It is expected to grow to US 7.68 billion with a Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.36% from 2023 to 2028. The main cause for this growth is the relative increase in world population.</p> \n<p>Therefore, packaging for agricultural products will have an upward trend regarding demand and supply. Businesses and consumers can mutually benefit by collaborating to ensure consumable food is safe from contamination through quality packaging.</p> \n<h2>8 packaging for agriculture products</h2> \n<h3>Glass bottles and jars</h3> \n<p>Glass bottlesprovide consumers with safe storage for liquid agricultural products such as milk, fruit juices, and vegetable oils. They can be made into different shapes and sizes, but their common feature is a narrow neck and a wider body.</p> \n<p>The design aims to aid in easily pouring the fluids and allow the fitting of caps for easy opening and closing. Typically, Glass bottles are made of a substance that can withstand temperatures of up to 50 degrees without breaking.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,glass jarsgive consumers the same storage purpose, but they can store solid and semi-solid products apart from liquids. Their mouths have a wider opening than a glass bottle and no neck to allow easy access to contents. Additionally,\u00a0 businesses can add labels or logos that help identify their brand from others.</p> \n<h3>Plastic or polythene bags</h3> \n<p>Plastic bagsare another alternative to meet the agricultural packaging demand. The advantage of polythene bags is that they are resistant to corrosion and are not affected by the weather. Also, they resist chemical substances that are base or acidic, thus, giving extra protection to the items inside them.</p> \n<p>Quality plastic bags should have features that include excellent oil and solvent resistance, heat sealable, and printability. Other packaging aspects of good polythene bags include comfortability and softness, low air permeability, and resistance to dust. Some bags can be clear, while others have an opaque color, such as black or green.</p> \n<h3>Jute or calico sacks</h3> \n<p>Unlike plastic bags made from polymers by an industrial process, jute orcalico sackhave natural fibers as their raw material and are, therefore, environmentally-friendly.</p> \n<p>Calico bagsare strong, carry more contents, last longer than plastic bags since they are not easy to tear, and offer good insulating properties.</p> \n<h3>Raschel mesh bag</h3> \n<p>Raschel mesh bagsfeature polyethylene mesh knitted in different patterns, such as honeycomb and square designs. Typically, raschel bags\u2019 primary materials are polymers from the factory or recycled plastic which helps care for the environment. The bags are tough and resistant to tearing.</p> \n<p>They work best for packaging fruits and vegetables because the meshes act as ventilation, allowing air to pass through the contents and keeping unwanted moisture away.\u00a0 This ensures freshness for extended periods.</p> \n<h3>Wooden crates and plastic crates</h3> \n<p>Wooden cratescomprise panels of wood conjoined with nails to create a cuboid or cube shape where consumers can keep items inside. They come in different sizes and dimensions. Some are also customizable and can be locked for consumers to have their agricultural produce safe and not roll away in transit.</p> \n<p>They also feature gaps between panels that allow air circulation. Businesses can also customize the panels with a company logo for consumers.</p> \n<p>The downside ofwooden cratesis their tendency to attract pests and rodents when consumers store them for a long time.</p> \n<h3>Vacuum seal bag</h3> \n<p>Vacuum seal bagsare made from plastic and have a seal that keeps the contents utterly secure from outside elements. Vacuum seal bags are an excellent option for preserving foods for extended periods.</p> \n<p>Vacuum seal bags are used for perishables such as meat, marinade, and chopped vegetables.</p> \n<p>Businesses can include vacuum seals in their collection of packaging products since they cover both transparent and opaque colors.</p> \n<h3>Hard plastic containers</h3> \n<p>Hard plastic containersshare the same features as plastic bottles, only that they are effective for packaging non-liquid agricultural products like butter. They may come with lids attached to them, which feature different colors to suit different consumers. They also have different sizes to fit different measurements of foods or other agricultural products.</p> \n<p>Plastic containers can be heat-sealable which helps prevent leakage of contents. They are also resistant to corrosion and hence can protect the contents inside.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Agricultural products will continue to be an important part of the global economy. As such, packaging for these products will need to be both functional and appealing to consumers.</p> \n<p>For more information about packaging for agricultural products, visitAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

For your business to expand and provide better customer service, this post will go over how to choose a trustworthy packaging manufacturer.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsGlobal packaging market overviewChoosing a reliable packaging manufacturerA reliable manufacturer improves sales</p> \n<h2>Global packaging market overview</h2> \n<p>The rapid urbanization of countries worldwide is fueling the growth of the global packaging market. One unique factor of urbanization is lifestyle changes, which spur a lot of packaging of products.</p> \n<p>For instance, the fast food industry flourishes in cities due to processed food packaging. Also, there\u2019s the packaging of electronics, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, household items, etc.</p> \n<p>An overview of the global packaging industry puts the market at an incremental value of USD 170.6 billion between 2021 and 2025. The value is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4%.</p> \n<p>Food packaging takes the lion\u2019s share of the industry, and as of 2020, it was worthUSD 323.8 billion. It was forecast to grow from USD 328.3 billion in 2021 to USD 478.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 5%. The market is driven by a shift in eating habits and lifestyle changes.</p> \n<h2>Choosing a reliable packaging manufacturer</h2> \n<p>Packaging plays a critical role in appealing to a buyer\u2019s visual impression. Some products end up in shopping carts because of their packaging. Therefore, as a company, it\u2019s imperative to source for a reliable packaging manufacturer. The following are some points to consider.</p> \n<h3>Leverage the logistics advantage</h3> \n<p>Currently, China is the world leader in many packaging companies. Most renowned companies have some, if not all, of their packaging done in China or ship the packaging material from the country.</p> \n<p>The Chinese airline industry has grown in leaps and bounds, with networks worldwide making it easy to deliver packaging material to customers. Likewise, due to China\u2019s large market, most airlines fly into Chinese industrial cities, making air cargo a faster way ofshipping.</p> \n<p>For instance,air freightto the U.S. can take 1-3 days if it\u2019s express, 8-10 days for regular air freight, and 30-40 days forocean freight. Considering the distance from China to the U.S., the above options offer a decent turnaround time for a company to procure packaging materials.</p> \n<h3>Evaluate their custom packaging capabilities</h3> \n<p>Unique packaging always gives any product an edge over its competition. Companies are always after packaging that fits and promotes their brand. If possible, most companies want unique packaging tailored to their taste. And the packaging company should not use the same for their other customers.</p> \n<p>For example, jewelry needs to beuniquely packagedas an extension of its beauty and elegance. Before settling for a suitable supplier, a company should conduct due diligence by examining the manufacturer\u2019s portfolio and their products in the market to establish if they meet the threshold.</p> \n<h3>Understand structural engineering and quality control</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers often ought to have suitable structures to cope with the market demands of quantity and quality usingquality management systems(QMS).</p> \n<p>The company needs to have the capacity to ensure products meet the strict demands of the customer like shape, material quality, color, labeling, etc.</p> \n<p>For example, manufacturing packaging materials shouldn\u2019t go through quality control at the end of production only. It\u2019s advisable to apply quality control in all the stages of production, which include;</p> \n<p>Incoming quality control:Will check on the incoming materials, handle identified issues, and give feedback on quality issues</p> \n<p>In-process quality control:Will ensure material placement, testing methodology, machinery and tools check, staff handling procedure, etc.</p> \n<p>Final quality control and outgoing quality control:Will involve function testing, product appearance, packaging testing, etc.</p> \n<h3>Look for experience and reputation among their support staff</h3> \n<p>Staff experience for any manufacturing company plays a pivotal role in promoting the company\u2019s reputation.</p> \n<p>Churning out world-class packaging stems from acquiring the correct information from the customer, coming up with designs that capture the customer\u2019s imagination, and taking them through production.</p> \n<p>Also, engineers, product line managers, and assembly line workers need adequate experience to guarantee top-notch products during the manufacturing process. So, it would be best for a company to ensure packaging manufacturers have an experienced workforce to produce quality.</p> \n<h3>Ask for product certificates</h3> \n<p>A product certificate is evidence that a product has met strict guidelines of performance and quality assurance tests. That includes contracts, specifications, or regulations (certification schemes).</p> \n<p>The certification gives end-users confidence since the products have been internationally approved. It also means they have passed quality and safety standards.</p> \n<p>Currently, there arefour certificationssubject to which part of the world a company resides in. The certifications are unique to the U.S., Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and Africa with the Middle East. That said, the four certifications are as follows;</p> \n<p>Europe \u2013 CE Marking:The product is expected to meet the EU\u2019s directives of their basic standard safety, health, and environmental requirements. CE Marking is a legal requirement that allows the free trade of products in the EU/EEA.</p> \n<p>U.S. \u2013 FCC Declaration of Conformity:It\u2019s a declaration mark for electronics that are manufactured or sold in the U.S. Some include IT equipment and medical or industrial devices emitting RF radiation.</p> \n<p>U.S., Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia \u2013 IECEE CB Scheme:The CB Scheme of the International Electrotechnical Commission for Electrical Equipment is a worldwide system of product safety test reports and certificates with mutual acceptance.</p> \n<p>U.S. \u2013 FDA:The Food and Drug Administration is an American entity that\u2019s responsible for the safety of substances like food, cosmetics, medical devices, and veterinarian and tobacco products.</p> \n<p>Similarly, a packaging company should meet certification requirements for the customer\u2019s products to be considered in the local or world market.</p> \n<h3>Value factory qualification</h3> \n<p>According to theBerkeley Sourcing group, factory qualifications are processes that need to meet specific criteria. They use manufacturing, tooling, quality control, and prototyping criteria as yardsticks to qualify credible manufacturing companies.</p> \n<p>In manufacturing, factory qualifications ensure the factory sources suitableraw materialsand maintain high standards in production.</p> \n<p>In tooling, they ensure the factory is well-equipped with the right tools to produce quality products.</p> \n<p>A prototype is different from the first sample. A prototype is a product used to test the market to determine if it meets the standards and identifies what needs improvement.</p> \n<p>In quality control, factory qualifications ensure that selected factories maintain and improve quality control to meet customer expectations.</p> \n<h3>Opt for a stable supply chain</h3> \n<p>A stable supply chain is essential for the packaging manufacturer to avoid delays in delivery, which can lead to losses for the customer. Case in point, if packaging for a cosmetic is not delivered on time, the product can\u2019t be dispatched to the market.</p> \n<p>If the company is working with timelines concerning sales, a delay in revenue will cause a ripple effect in the company\u2019s administrative responsibilities. Some of the duties can be delayed salaries or canceled orders.</p> \n<h2>A reliable manufacturer improves sales</h2> \n<p>Reliable packaging manufacturers play a pivotal role in the sales of products. Unique packages, quick manufacturing, and adherence to high quality all lead to consistent sales for the customer\u2019s products.</p> \n<p>That means there will be no delays, the customers will always get value for money, and the customer\u2019s brand will grow, raking in more revenue.</p> \n"}]}

When it comes to packaging for pets, visual appeal as well as ease of use are big factors with consumer choices. The most popular styles of packaging for pets range from various food bags to high quality boxes.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market value of packaging for petsPackaging for pets trends: top 5 choicesFuture direction for packaging for pets</p> \n<h2>The market value of packaging for pets</h2> \n<p>In recent years the market has seen an increase in demand for more superior materials when it comes to packaging for pets. Consumers are also being more conscious with pet food ingredients, and are looking to purchasepet productsthat have a more luxurious appearance to them, and that help to promote a healthy diet for their animals.</p> \n<p>In 2020 the pet food packaging market was valued at USD 9.4 billion. This number is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 5.7% between 2021 and 2030, reaching approximately USD 16.6 billion. The increase in consumers owning pets has marked an upsurge in the variety of pet food in the market, and as these consumers are starting to have a larger disposable income, more sales are being made than ever before.</p> \n<h2>Packaging for pets trends: top 5 choices</h2> \n<p>There is a wide variety of packaging for pets in today\u2019s market, but not all are suitable for every type of food. Trends in the packaging industry are seeing increasing demands for stand-up pouches, paper tube packaging, liquid pouches, corrugated shipping boxes, and four side seal pouches. Here\u2019s a look at the key features of each one.</p> \n<h3>Stand-up pouches</h3> \n<p>There\u2019s no shortage of varieties when it comes to pet food packaging, but some are better suited than others for the type of food being stored in them. Thestand-up pouchis a popular choice among consumers, as the size makes it easy to store both at home and on shop shelves, and the sealable opening means that the products stay fresh longer once opened.</p> \n<p>Unlike larger sizes of packaging for pets, the stand-up pouch takes up minimal space and can easily be taken on the go as well. For many consumers, sustainability is a key factor when choosing packaging, and the stand-up pouch is completely recyclable which is an added bonus.</p> \n<h3>Paper packaging tube</h3> \n<p>Many types of pet food are traditionally sold in tins, but thepaper packaging tubeis beginning to rise in popularity and replace metal tins. Thistype of packaginghelps to keep the contents fresh as it\u2019s both airtight and moisture proof, and the variety of lid choices means that it\u2019s fully customizable too. The paper packaging makes it ideal for storing powders or dry treats, and is more environmentally friendly than tins or plastic.</p> \n<h3>Liquid pouches</h3> \n<p>Thestand-up liquid pouchis probably best known forfood and drinks packaging, but it\u2019s being seamlessly integrated into packaging for pets too. This style of packaging is a good choice for liquid pet food or treats, as it has various nozzle caps to choose from, is fully sealable, and creates a superior moisture barrier. The pouch itself can have any cover printed on it for maximum visual appeal too.</p> \n<p>The larger nozzle caps are helping to transform the stand-up liquid pouch from a liquids-only packaging to one that can be used to dispense smaller pet food or treats simply by pouring them from the bag. Food such as bird seeds, puppy food, and rabbit pellets are just some examples of the type of food that can be stored in this style of packaging for pets.</p> \n<h3>Corrugated shipping box</h3> \n<p>Packaging is important during all points of the sale process, and that includes if an item is being shipped or stored in a physical shop. Thecorrugated shipping boxis the perfect way to make an impact on the consumer, by having it fully customized to match the brand and items inside.</p> \n<p>These boxes can securely hold heavy products while in transit, and are an easy way to store bags or boxes of pet food and toys. For the eco-conscious consumers out there, these secure boxes can be repurposed for other storage needs or household projects, and in some cases can be used by their pets. This is one of the most popular packaging for pets on the market today.</p> \n<h3>Four side seal pouch</h3> \n<p>When consumers purchase pet food or cat litter, they tend to buy large bags that will last. Thefour side seal pouchis a popular style of packaging for pets that\u2019s been around for a long time, and continues to be a big hit. The large size of the pouch makes it easy for consumers to scoop out the contents, and it\u2019s easy to store as it can stand by itself without falling over.</p> \n<p>What makes this type of packaging better than others is the premium look it has. The zipper closure makes it look more upscale, and helps to highlight the freshness of the product inside while keeping pets out. The overall design of the pouch can be adjusted as well, to better suit the type of consumer that the company is targeting.</p> \n<h2>Future direction for packaging for pets</h2> \n<p>Packaging for pets comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and styles. While not all types of packaging are suitable for everything, these popular styles help to make a positive impact on the consumer and therefore increase sales. Corrugated shipping boxes, stand-up pouches,paper packagingtubes, liquid pouches, and four side seal pouches are all proving to be the most popular types of packaging for pets today.</p> \n<p>The packaging market is seeing a steady increase in packaging becoming more eco-friendly, so it\u2019s expected that more sustainable materials will continue to be used in the future but they will still take on the traditional shape of the most popular types of packaging for pets.</p> \n"}]}

A mug appears to be universally regarded asa fairly dull gift optionto most people, although everyone\u2019s definition of \u201cboring\u201d might vary quite a little. However, on the flip side, it is not because a mug or cup is seen as worthless that it is viewed as a less interesting choice; rather, it is precisely due to its tremendous usefulness and essentiality that nearly everyone already had at least two of it (one for home and another one for workplace)!</p> \n<p>Anyway, days of boring mugs or cups could be coming to an end soon, with the growing popularity ofsmart mugs/smart water bottlesnowadays given their declining costs. This provides yet another intriguing reason to keep reading to learn more about the significance of drinkware packaging and the business prospects that come with it!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe importance of drinkware packagingMajor trends for drinkware packaging in 2022A quick wrap-up</p> \n<h2>The importance of drinkware packaging</h2> \n<p>Much like the packaging for all other general products, the main purpose of packaging for drinkware is to protect the content. Adequately packaged drinkware is crucial in guaranteeing beverage hygienic security, on top of protecting the drinkware from any unwanted breakage, scratch, or crack.</p> \n<p>The present emphasis on health and safety that has emerged over the last few years has propelled the drinkware packaging makers to meet those stringent goals in packaging requirements. And the ability to fulfill those goals is closely associated with the brand identity of the makers as well.</p> \n<p>The rapid growth of industry estimates derived from numerous studies is an indication of the significance of packaging in the drinkware sector. For instance, one report in 2018 predicted that the global drinkware market would grow at a3.1%compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between the 2019 to 2025 forecast period, reaching $4.79 billion. Fast forward to 2022, a separate international market research firm raised the prediction to$13.4 billion by 2027, with a CAGR of 4% from 2022 to 2027.</p> \n<h2>Major trends for drinkware packaging in 2022</h2> \n<h3>Custom cardboard packaging box</h3> \n<p>According toresearch, the global custom boxes market will reach $71 billion by 2032 and increase at a CAGR of 4.4% between 2022 and 2032. Food and beverage packaging is the main end-use category driving this expansion, and the key trend driving this market growth is identified as the brand value that custom packaging may offer.</p> \n<p>Indeed, most standard or ready-made packaging may hardly accomplish the intended brand strategy. Instead, custom packaging is tailored to match specific business needs.</p> \n<p>The need for custom packaging is also being driven by the emergence of unconventional drinkware sizes or shapes, including those with accessories such as straws, handles, and lids. Thankfully, with the advancement of printing techniques such as improvement in CMYK printing and the decline in production costs, both sizes and designs are now customizable, be it for asquare box,rectangle box, ortube packaging.</p> \n<p>In line with the marketing and branding strategy of a business, customized packaging designs fordrinkware gift setsor a full set of drinkware are also made possible, such as the one depicted in the picture below.</p> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>According toglobal research, online searches for sustainable products have increased worldwide by 71% over the past five years. Sustainable options are definitely growing consumer preference as proven bymultiple studies. To the drinkware packaging industry, however, the quest for sustainable packaging can be even more apparent year by year.</p> \n<p>As the majority of drinkware such as glass bottles, mugs and tumblers are made of fragile materials like glass and ceramic, the level of protection that a drinkware packaging can offer continues to be the primary concern of both the manufacturers and the customers. Meanwhile, in order to accomplish its protective goal, most product packaging for delicate goods tends to be fairly bulky, considerably larger than the actual goods themselves to provide the utmost protection they are designed to. As a result, such packaging often leaves the end-users with lots of unwanted packaging waste that can be really unfriendly to the environment.</p> \n<p>For this reason, sustainable packaging such ascorrugated cardboard for drinkwarecan help to save the environment from huge packaging waste. According to Fibre Box Association (FBA), a non-profit trade association that represents corrugated packaging in North America, corrugated material can protect fragile goods fairly well through its structural rigidity that provides cushioning effects. Meanwhile, as shown in the picture below,holographic finishing packagingis probably the solution to the common perception that corrugated cardboard packaging can be relatively boring with its standard typical brown or white color.</p> \n<p>Drinkware packaging made fromkraft paper, on the other hand, is another eco-friendly, recyclable material for a solid packaging choice to serve the sustainable drinkware packaging purpose.</p> \n<h3>Transparent packaging</h3> \n<p>When it comes to food product packaging, transparency has always beena favorite among consumer goods. And the projected growth of the worldwide transparent food packaging market at arate of 4.4%from 2022 to 2029 continues to prove that transparent packaging is the preferred option for many companies to showcase the authenticity and quality of their products.</p> \n<p>At the same time, transparent packaging helps toconvey brand valuewhile saving on the packaging design fee, since the product itself serves as a great design when being presented transparently.</p> \n<p>For example, drinkware can be displayed in afully transparent coffee mug packaging box, which showcases the product from every angle. Alternatively, it can be in a partially transparent form such as thisdrinkware packaging box with a transparent coverortransparent window, as shown in the picture below.</p> \n<h2>A quick wrap-up</h2> \n<p>Drinkware packaging today serves a significant purpose in brand value communication in addition to its conventional protective role in shielding items from breakage and hygienic concerns. In a nutshell, custom packaging, sustainable packaging, and transparent packaging are the top three drinkware packaging trends to look out for this year. Essentially, packaging for drinkware is currently aiming to be more ecologically friendly, customized, and brand-oriented. Wholesalers might explore these developments to benefit from their expansion. To understand more about top packaging trends, check out theAlibaba.com Readspage.</p> \n"}]}

This is a guide to the top shopping bag types that are useful for any business to know.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsDriving factors in shopping bag trendsTop shopping bag typesShift towards eco-friendly alternatives</p> \n<h2>Driving factors in shopping bag trends</h2> \n<p>There are a few driving factors that are influencing current shopping bag trends.High-quality shopping bagsare becoming more popular as companies aim to create a luxury shopping experience for customers. To help make the purchase of a product more appealing, retail bags are also being offered in different exciting colors and fashions.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the growing regulation andbans on plastic bagsis pushing businesses towards reusable shopping bags or bags made from biodegradable or recyclable materials. The reusable shopping bag market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 2.8%between 2022 and 2028. An European consumer preferences survey commissioned by Two Sides in 2020 also found that70% of consumersare actively taking steps to reduce their use of plastic packaging. In response, many retailers are using eco-friendly bags to help reduce their environmental impact and meet sustainability targets.</p> \n<h2>Top shopping bag types</h2> \n<h3>Plastic grocery bag</h3> \n<p>One of the most standard types of shopping bags is theplastic grocery bag. These bags are frequently used by supermarkets, convenience stores, and shopping malls for bagging grocery products or clothing items.</p> \n<p>Plastic grocery bagsare sometimes referred to as single-use plastic bags even though they can be reused by consumers for other purposes. Grocery bags are traditionally made from a plastic known as polyethylene, but modern bags may be made of vegetable-based bioplastics. Bioplastics are a more environmentally sustainable option because they can decay organically and prevent a build-up of toxic plastic bags in landfills. Shopping bags made from polylactic acid (PLA) plastic, a plastic substitute made from cornstarch, are quickly becoming an alternative to petroleum-based plastics.PLA plastic bagsare 100% compostable and biodegradable.</p> \n<p>Plastic shopping bagsare generally translucent or opaque and will often come with custom printing of the company logo and other company information.</p> \n<h3>Plastic die cut bag</h3> \n<p>Plastic die cut bags are a more durable alternative to plastic grocery bags.Die cut plastic bagsare commonly used for bagging clothing and accessories, smaller grocery items, or beauty and skincare products.</p> \n<p>Die cut bagsare plastic shopping bags that come with a cut-out handle along the top. For sturdier construction, they can be designed with reinforced fold-over or patch die cut handles. Larger die cut bags may also come with bottom gussets that allow the bag to hold more items.</p> \n<p>Die cut handle bags can be made from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) materials. LDPE die cut bags are highly resistant to tearing and punctures, while HDPE bags are more durable overall.Die cut handle bagscan be manufactured in a variety of colors with custom printing to add branding or special designs.</p> \n<h3>Laminated paper bag</h3> \n<p>Laminated paper bagsare an elegant and upscale shopping bag type for high-end retailers. They are generally used for fashion items or skincare and beauty products.</p> \n<p>Laminated paper shopping bagsare made from paper or cardstock with a polypropylene lamination. They are available in high gloss, matte, or soft touch finishes. Paper bags with lamination will often be designed as stand-up shopping bags that can be folded flat for transport purposes.</p> \n<p>Paper shopping bags can be finished with different types of handles made from die cutting, cotton ropes, satin bands, or twisted paper. For a unique look, thelaminated paper bagcan be customized with graphics applied through flex printing, screen printing, or hot foil stamping.</p> \n<h3>Kraft shopping bag</h3> \n<p>Although paper shopping bags can come in many materials, including white cardboard, offset paper, recycled paper, or newspaper print, kraft paper is a popular choice due to its strength and durability.Kraft shopping bagsare more durable than other types of paper because they do not require extensive bleaching, which is a process that can reduce paper strength.Kraft paper bagsare widely used by restaurants or supermarkets for food takeaway and groceries.</p> \n<p>Kraft paper is made from sulfate wood pulp, and although kraft paperbags can be customizedwith color, many retailers will choose to retain the material\u2019s more natural shades of brown, white, or cream. Additionally,kraft paper shopping bagsare generally kept plain with no logos or branding, but can be finished with die cut or twine handles. With the rising costs of wood-based paper, some businesses are also turning to paper made from bamboo or sugarcane as an alternative.</p> \n<h3>Textile shopping bag</h3> \n<p>Textile shopping bagsare a popular reusable bag option for retail stores and grocery stores looking for an alternative to single-use paper or plastic bags. They are often designed as a tote bag, drawstring bag, or net bag.Textile retail bagscan be made from a variety of fabrics, including canvas, cotton, jute, twill, polyester, or hemp.</p> \n<p>Largertextile bagswill generally come with a bottom gusset to help keep items stable. They may also be designed with long handles to allow customers to carry the bag from their shoulders. High-end grocery stores may even offer insulated shopping bags that function as a cooler bag to keep groceries fresh. Textile bags can come in a wide range of colors and customized designs to help promote and spread awareness about a brand.</p> \n<h2>Shift towards eco-friendly alternatives</h2> \n<p>Plastic grocery bags and die cut bags are some of the most widely used types of shopping bags, but the growing trend towardseco-friendly packagingrequires businesses to shift focus away from virgin plastic. The European consumer preferences survey commissioned by Two Sides in 2020 concluded that62% of consumerssee paper packaging as better for the environment. As a result of changing consumer tastes, retailers are beginning to transition to laminated paper, kraft paper, or textile shopping bags.</p> \n<p>Although plastic shopping bags continue to be a basic option for many retailers, businesses are advised to explore recyclable and bio-based plastics, prioritize recycled paper bags, or invest in reusable textile bags to help minimize their environmental footprint.</p> \n"}]}

These features should be considered when matching products to packaging, as the packaging will help to attract consumers to the brand and encourage sales of the fancily packaged item.</p> \n<p>Another consideration should be recyclability.

Finding the right fancy packaging can be tricky, so here are five potential ideas for five types of products that can give business owners a good starting point when deciding on which packaging to purchase.</p> \n<h3>Apparel</h3> \n<p>When considering apparel packaging and the clearyear-on-year increase in online clothingsales, it is important to think about the evolution of the packaging needed. When shopping in stores, plastic or paper bags are often used. However, with shipping involved when buying online, packaging has to be adapted to suit traveling. Quite often apparel is bagged incompostable mailer bags. They are eco-friendly and come in a variety of colors to reflect the brand\u2019s ideals.The bagsare often personalized and printed with branding to be easily recognizable.</p> \n<p>Branding is how fancy packaging for apparel can aid in marketing the brand. Big brands nowadays often use fancy box packaging covered with their iconic logos; the clothing inside is carefully encased in tissue paper giving the end consumer an exciting unboxing experience. Potential ideas includefoldable card boxesthat have a plain outer side and are easily enhanced with a retro stamp style logo, creating some individuality to the design. Equally, many of theboxesavailable are also customizable at the purchasing stage, allowing a business owner to have personalized branding printed directly and creatingcustom luxury boxesperfect for apparel.</p> \n<h3>Cosmetics</h3> \n<p>When consumers buycosmetics, the packagingis normally a big pulling point. It can often define the quality of a product, so choosing wisely is essential. A good starting point is understanding the brand. A fun and quirky shower gel/shampoo brand might like the idea of aneco, refillable pouch. Not only is this easy to transport, but it also has asustainable selling point, making the product inside more appealing. If the brand is a small luxury cosmetic business, thenglass,woodorbamboojars and bottles are a great option. They exude quality and can be easily branded with vinyl stickers orUV printed. These materials are eco-friendly and often come with minimal use of plastic, creating an additional positive selling point.</p> \n<p>Another eco-friendly product that lends itself well to similar eco-box luxury is the bar of soap.Sales in bars of soapsare increasing along with the need to package them. The types of fancy packaging available are quite versatile, from simple individualsoap boxes, tomulti boxes. Many are made from cardboard and can be easilypersonalizedand decorated to suit the scent inside and the brand identity.

Again, like with many other packaging ideas, eco is the way forward with food. It has beenhighly publicizedthat food packaging is one of the mostimpactingin terms of waste. Therefore, small business owners should ensure food is wrapped consciously and minimally to truly appeal to the modern end consumer.</p> \n<p>Tea and chocolate make interesting gifts and often have some of the most uniquely designed packagings. Specialist tea can be encased incylindrical cardboard tubes, allowing space for brand design aspects and crucial nutritional information. Also, they are recyclable and reusable for home storage. For chocolate bars,packaging paperwith unique designs printed on them is a great and cost-effective way for a wholesaler. However, if supplyingluxurious chocolatebrands, then a more traditional style box for individual chocolates might be a better selection. This can be branded with smalllabelsto create a more opulent feel, rather than with pre-printed paper.</p> \n<h3>Homeware gifts</h3> \n<p>Packaging for homeware giftsis protective and also makes the product seem extra special for the person receiving it. Fancy box packing within this department is often more functional as well as attractive than other packaged goods. Homeware gifts can be breakable so consideration towards protective fancy packaging is essential.</p> \n<p>Currently, popular homeware gifts includecandles, and packaging them is crucial as the wax is frequently encased in a glass jar. There is beautifulfancy box packagingavailable for candles. They are made from sturdy cardboard and come in a range of colors, which can be adapted to trends or brand identity. Equally, bothcubedandcylindricaldesigns are good options. A business buyer may want to consider the shape of the luxury packaging based on the ease of transportation\u2014cubes can save on space when shipping.</p> \n<p>For wholesalers who have multiple homeware gift items,large boxesthat fit several gifts inside are an ideal selection. They often have room for an embossed logo on the lid and have a magnetic closing, which makes this fancy box packaging reusable, giving additional appeal through its sustainable features.</p> \n<h3>Fashion accessories</h3> \n<p>When it comes to fancy box packaging for fashion accessories, the options are varied depending on the wholesale item. The focus here differs from some of the packagings already mentioned. Likecosmetics packaging, fashion accessories packaging can be the tell-tale sign as to the quality of the item within it. Therefore, fancy box packaging here has to have the wow factor to appeal to the consumer.</p> \n<p>Jewelrysuch as earrings is a great example of the direction to go in when choosing packaging. Wholesalers might veer away from eco-packaging and look for something that will last. Often, when not wearing earrings, people store them inside the box they came in, so having durable and beautiful fancy box packaging is the way to go.Velvet boxesare the perfect packaging to showcase earrings or other items of jewelry. Watches are another popular accessory and theirluxury packagingcan double as adisplay for the watchwhen it is not being worn and a way to protect it.</p> \n<h2>Why brands should choose fancy packaging</h2> \n<p>Fancy brand packaging is essential across all markets. Business owners should ensure that packaging choices are made in conjunction with the product being sold, as the outer box is the first thing that is seen by the end consumer and will help them decide on whether or not to buy the product.</p> \n<p>A key feature for business buyers to consider when selecting fancy packaging is an appealing design with a good brand identity (which can often be added to the packaging purchased). They should also focus on eco, sustainable packaging and keeping up to speed withcurrent trends.</p> \n<p>Business owners who take into consideration good and attractive packaging that has the possibility of being reused or recycled will appeal more to the end consumer and therefore will likely increase sales of their product.</p> \n"}]}

Above all, increased health consciousness has made safely packaged food and beverage one of the default predilections for virtually every type of food and drink now. In many areas, unprecedented city controls have indirectly popularized convenience food, the readily consumable food packaged in a healthful, handy packaging. The expansion of thefooddelivery sector has further accelerated the growth of the food and beverage packaging industry. At such a rapid rate of growth, let\u2019s look at a few of the most promising food and beverage packaging ideas that no wholesaler should miss!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsRole of packaging in food and beveragesImportant food and beverages packaging trends in 2022Key points to consider</p> \n<h2>Role of packaging in food and beverages</h2> \n<p>Packaging for food and beverages serves the same primary purpose as packaging for all other general goods: to protect the content. An appropriately packaged food can help to reduce food loss and waste. This is essential in ensuring food security in light of today\u2019s increased risk of food crises, which is driven by population growth, climate change, and resource constraints. Two other major roles that categorically distinguish food and beverage packaging solutions from other standard packaging are food safety and food freshness preservation.</p> \n<p>Indeed, with all of the recent emphasis on health and safety, food and beverage packaging manufacturers must strive to meet these de facto objectives now. Such functions rise to the heart of the role in food packaging because they are intrinsically linked to the brand identity of the food and beverages companies too, another key function of food and beverage packaging.</p> \n<p>One can get a glimpse of the importance of the roles of packaging in the food and beverage industry through the exponential growth of industry forecasts from various research. For instance,a study conducted in 2019forecasted a mere 1.2% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the worldwide food and beverage packaging development by 2030, hitting USD 368.3 billion by then. Yet, in 2020, barely a year later, another global market research company had raised the forecast by almost five times, to aCAGR of 5.1%instead. This CAGR forecast applies to the projection period of 2021-2028, with USD 338.34 billion predicted in 2021 and USD 478.18 billion expected seven years later.</p> \n<h2>Important food and beverages packaging trends in 2022</h2> \n<h3>Personalized packaging</h3> \n<p>Personalized packaging is definitely on the rise in the food packaging world. A report published in February 2022 predicted the worldwide personalized packaging market to reachUSD 21.2 billionby 2029, growing at a record-breaking CAGR of 6.1% from 2022 to 2029. This is a jump of over 20% from the CAGR of 5.0% between 2014 and 2021. And the sector that contributes the most to this growth is none other than the food and beverage packaging, which relies heavily on packaging for both practical and marketing reasons.</p> \n<p>Personalized packaging essentially boils down to printing customization, where lower costs and easier, faster printing solutions such as digital printing help to eventuate bespoke packaging even for small quantities. For example, as shown in the picture below, a digital printing enabledstand-up kraft paper bagor atransparent digital printed zipper bagmay well serve the purpose.</p> \n<p>Digital printing can also be applied tobeverage packaging with shrink sleeve labels, as featured in this picture:</p> \n<h3>Interactive packaging</h3> \n<p>The global surge in food safety and security awareness in recent years, fueled by increased concerns about health and well-being, has accentuated one key issue: general consumers\u2019 confidence in food suppliers and manufacturers.</p> \n<p>Branding is therefore needed, now more than ever, to help reinforce and deepen the trust between the food and beverage providers and their end-users. And this is where interactive packaging can play a part and be fully utilized to further elevate the brand image.</p> \n<p>In a nutshell, interactive packaging refers to the deployment of smart label technology such as Quick Response (QR) codes and near field communication (NFC) tags on the packaging. It allows the customers to scan these codes and tags with their smart devices and gain access to whatever info the food and beverage providers would like to highlight. From trusted food sources and ingredients to eco-friendly policy and loyalty programs, almost anything that can help establish trust and rapport can be included. Perhaps the best part of such smart label branding is that it does not require much space and may hence help to save on packaging costs too.</p> \n<p>To create interactive packaging, a QR code can be printed on various label materials including self-adhesive stickers. For food and beverage packaging, thestickers should ideally be waterproofand come with the right resolution for clear printing output. Somepackaging stickers also come with anti-counterfeitingfeatures that offer to print out a secure QR code to prevent counterfeit products, such as the one featured here:</p> \n<p>AnNFC tag, on the other hand, is a sticker that has small built-in microchips readable by smart devices from up to around 10cm away:</p> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>With increasing concerns over global climate change and environmental issues, sustainable packaging is another indisputable trend in the current packaging industry. The worldwide sustainable packaging market is expected to grow at a healthy CAGR of 7.55% between 2022 to 2027, with the food and beverage industry among the top three end-user sectors for it.</p> \n<p>The popularity of food delivery services and convenience food over the past few years signifies that people are loaded with food packaging waste on a regular basis, almost every single day, if not every few hours. Alleco-friendly packagingis hence likely to be appreciated by them to reuse or recycle any packaging wherever possible. Consequently, this can also help to establish a healthy and positive brand image for the food providers, especially when they manage to provide well thought out reusable packaging designs such as akraft zipper bagorreusable food container.</p> \n<p>Apart from reusable items, other environmentally friendly food and beverage packaging that can contribute to global sustainability, such as adisposable paper cupwith a lid orbiodegradable food container, can also enhance the food provider\u2019s brand image. For example, various shapes and sizes of disposable and biodegradable takeout food packaging containers are shown here:</p> \n<h2>Key points to consider</h2> \n<p>As a result of worldwide rising consciousness in health and wellness, packaging for food and beverage has evolved from simple protection and food freshness preservation to the first line of defense against food safety, further solidifying its role in brand image building. Personalized packaging, interactive packaging, and sustainable packaging are three major trends that will shape the growth of food and beverage packaging in 2022. In essence, food and beverage packaging is now getting more individualized, interactional and in line with the worldwide packaging trends, moving in the direction of being more environmentally friendly. Wholesalers can explore the potential of these trends to reap the gains of the expanding momentum. Checkthis articleout to learn more about food packing.</p> \n"}]}

These types of bags are suitable for all styles of underwear, including bras and panties, but their flexible exterior may offer less protection for items like molded bras.</p> \n<p>The most widely used materials are waterproof plastics like PE or EVA.

Candy and snack products are something that will always remain a guilty pleasure for most. They are extremely popular among children and also especially popular during festive seasons. Revenue in confectionery and snacks amounts to$1.53 trillionin 2022, with most of it generated in the US.

The global snack food packaging market is expected to reach a market valuation of$25.9 billionby the end of 2031 from$17 billionin 2020, and the global confectionery packaging market is projected to reach$13.2 billionby 2027 when it is estimated to be at$10.9 billionin 2022.</p> \n<h2>Useful packaging styles favored by customers</h2> \n<h3>Convenient and portable</h3> \n<p>Packaging design and style is the first thing that jumps out to most people when shopping.

Such consumers are unlikely to purchase candy and snacks in huge containers, and many of them are likely to be younger children or students who buy tiny packets of snacks with their pocket money.</p> \n<p>Businesses catering to such groups should look into portable and flexible packaging that makes it easy for customers to purchase and bring with them. A useful option is theresealable stand-up pouch, which is a great packaging option for dried snacks since it can be resealed.</p> \n<p>Look into providing different material options likekraft paperorpolyester film.

Before we go through the packaging trends responsible for such a projection, let us understand why packaging style and container types are crucial details to pay close attention to.</p> \n<h3>To maintain food quality</h3> \n<p>No surprises. Packaging containers are essential to maintain food quality. It can be frustrating for customers to get their fried dishes all soggy or have greasy food leaking through the takeaway containers. It ruins their experience and the caterer\u2019s reputation. The container type and packaging methods are crucial to separate hot food from cold, keep food warm and fresh, and guarantee a safe delivery to customers\u2019 homes.</p> \n<h3>To sell more food</h3> \n<p>Packaging allows restaurants to sell more by charging premiums for delivery charges or specific packaging. Moreover, the science behind takeouts is crucial for repeat buys. Takeouts improve customer satisfaction. When a restaurant aces its packaging strategy, it brings back more customers and increases sales.</p> \n<h3>To showcase the brand image</h3> \n<p>Nowadays, the packaging style can tell a lot about a company\u2019s values. Customers are more aware of the environment and critical of how a business conducts itself to society. When a restaurant focuses on sustainability by using recyclable materials and biodegradable food packaging, customers know they show concern for the environment. In addition, some food chains like to strengthen their brand by incorporating fancy packaging designs and distinctive color combinations. As a result, all these factors help customers recall the brand better.</p> \n<h2>Types of food packaging trends</h2> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>Times have changed with customers wanting to know the different materials their takeaway food containers are made of. People are more aware of many environmental issues and critical of packaging materials they get from various food chains. Many restaurants practice sustainable packaging to steer social responsibility and look out for the environment. Sustainable packaging consists in using recyclable, compostable, and reusable containers. One of the most commonly used takeout materials is paper. Paper is biodegradable and pretty cost-effective. It allows heat insulation and occupies less space, making it a reliable material for storing meals.</p> \n<p>Paper bowlsare great for storing salads, and cardboard boxes are used for pizza delivery because they keep it warm and have small holes on the side to allow some air to escape. As a result, they prevent food from getting soggy.Cardboard sleeveskeep fried items such as french fries warm and crispy. And most fast-food chains deliver food in paper bags. The only downside to paper materials is storing greasy food, or else they can cause leaks which could spoil one\u2019s eating experience.</p> \n<p>The latest sustainable packaging trend is using materials such as PLA bioplastics (usually made from cornstarch) orbagasse pizza boxes(usually derived from sugarcane remains). They are compostable and environmentally friendly materials used to package food. However, they are often on the expensive side.</p> \n<h3>Convenient packaging</h3> \n<p>Takeout containers were initially invented for convenience. With busy lifestyles, customers need grab-and-go foods with easy-removable containers and wrappers to put minimal effort into them. Takeout containers that are labeled properly with clear fonts can help customers make swift decisions.</p> \n<p>Firmpaper cupsare reliable in holding liquid and ensure it stays intact in a moving car.Biodegradable takeaway containersare lightweight and easily carryable by customers during rush hours.

It is going back to basics as it makes no use of unnecessary packaging materials and redundant designs to get its message across and deliver ultimate satisfaction for consumers. This trend catches the eyes of many restaurant chains because it saves costs and useseco-friendly packagingmaterials to assist their cause.</p> \n<p>With fewer designs or a lack of redundant packaging, restaurants are more likely to communicate their message to consumers better than they would with complicated artwork all over the place.Aluminum foil containersare durable packaging materials that require minimal labeling and designs. They can be reliable in storing greasy and oily foods. On the other hand, aluminum containers are not microwave friendly.</p> \n<h3>Transparent packaging</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, it is all about looks. When hungry customers order a takeaway, they adore staring at their mouthwatering food when they grab those containers out of the bag. Restaurants make use of transparent packaging so they can display food\u2014mainly cakes and baked products. This type of packaging can make takeout food look more elegant and gives consumers a good view of the food\u2019s condition.</p> \n<p>In this situation,disposable plastic containerscan give cakes and other baked goods a clear transparent look. They offer good protection and can hold in moisture well. They are durable for most kinds of foods and on top of that, very eco-friendly.</p> \n<h3>Personalized packaging</h3> \n<p>Personalized packaging helps restaurants build strong relationships with regular customers through personalized notes during packaging. It takes branding to another level. Restaurants make an effort to know each customer\u2019s name and attach personal messages to the food packaging.</p> \n<p>In these current times, when social distancing can keep us apart often from socializing with close ones, personalized packaging can help create a bond with the customers.

With many influencers showcasing different skin care products on YouTube, people are up to date with the latest skincare and beauty trends. Nonetheless, to protect brand integrity and quality of skin care products, a high-end packaging strategy has to be followed.</p> \n<p>This article will cover the importance of packaging for skin care products and go over different packaging materials andlabel trendsfor skin care products.</p> \n<p>Table of contents:Why do skin care products need a packaging strategy?Types of packaging materials for skin care productsWhat is the future trend of skin care packaging?</p> \n<h2>Why do skin care products need a packaging strategy?</h2> \n<p>The global skin care market is booming. By 2025, it is estimated to have a market size of aroundUSD 189.3 billion. Nowadays, consumers are being more conscious of their skin and are using skin care products at an increasingly young age. As a result, younger consumers raise the demand for these products and wholesalers will require adequate packaging material to support their bulk production. Here are 3 important reasons why packaging is crucial for skin care products:</p> \n<h3>Ability to withstand inside contents</h3> \n<p>Many skin care products hold acidic or fruit extract contents inside. Sometimes, these contents can corrode metal-based containers if not coated properly. On the other hand, there are creams or gels that require a flexible material to help squeeze the contents out for convenience. Hence, it is essential to choose the right packaging material for specific skin care product contents.</p> \n<h3>Resistance to external conditions</h3> \n<p>External factors can affect the skin care products too. For example, essential oils are highly sensitive to light. Thus, they require non-translucent packaging to block the light. Additionally, labels have to be resistant to external factors so that they do not peel off due to moisture and oil, or lose color due to acidic contents.</p> \n<h3>Maintenance of brand image</h3> \n<p>Skin care packaging exhibits the company\u2019s brand image. The label itself tells consumers about its quality and what they stand for. Using a consistent design and attractive style of packaging establishes a brand image in the consumer\u2019s minds. Moreover, consumers are more aware that contents like BPA are not something they want present in their products. Hence, wholesalers use BPA-free plastics to package skin care products.</p> \n<h2>Types of packaging materials for skin care products</h2> \n<h3>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene plastic (PP)</h3> \n<p>Polyester orPET cosmetic containersare easily customizable and can come in different colors. Their structures range from rigid to semi-rigid, making them a popular choice for squeezable tubes.</p> \n<p>PET is best for holding high-acidic and oil contents as it acts as a barrier to these substances, avoiding deterioration and still maintaining its fine shape. Additionally,PET adhesive label stickersact as a durable label option for skin care products, withstanding moisture and oil substances.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, polypropylene plastics are more rigid. They are recyclable and BPA-free, making them an eco-friendly choice for packaging skin care products. Moreover, PP are cost-effective alternatives for labels. They are durable, stretchable, and resistant to oil, greases, and moisture.</p> \n<h3>Glass</h3> \n<p>Glass is recyclable, making it a good eco-friendly option. In addition, it makes the packaging look elegant with its clear and frosted look.Glass jarsanddropper bottlesare fine choices for holding serum, essential oils, etc.</p> \n<p>However, glass packaging is more expensive to ship and is breakable. Hence, it is advisable to not have breakable glass jars for shower gels or cream that would be placed in a bathroom.</p> \n<h3>Metal</h3> \n<p>Metal-based cosmetic containersrequire special coating in advance to avoid corrosion against essential oils or acidic contents. However, metal can give a great look when packaged right. Its unique feature is that it can be used as a coating on plastic-based skin care product bottles.</p> \n<h3>High density polyethylene (HDPE)</h3> \n<p>High density polyethylene (HDPE) is a fine choice to hold high-acidic and alcohol-based skin care products. It is strong, durable, and one of the simplest plastics to recycle.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it can come in translucent and opaque forms depending on the manufacturer\u2019s choice. However, HDPE is not suitable to hold essential oils as it can come in contact with the plastic and eat it away.</p> \n<h3>Paper box</h3> \n<p>To add the finishing touches,cosmetic boxesare the ideal packaging style to ship beauty products from one place to another. Since skin care products are delicate to hold,paper boxesfacilitate efficient shipping.</p> \n<p>They are eco-friendly and biodegradable, making them suitable for the environment. Moreover, they are highly customizable and affordable, making paper a reliable packaging material.</p> \n<h2>What is the future trend of skin care packaging?</h2> \n<p>Currently, the above trends are dominating the skin care packaging industry. However, with the rising demand for skin care products and dynamic market trends, we can expect trends to evolve faster than ever before.</p> \n<p>Skin care products are widely popular among female consumers\u2014especially the younger audience. But the rise of environmental awareness among consumers can mean more eco-friendly packaging using biodegradable and recyclable materials.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, it is a great time for businesses to ensure they support bulk production with sufficient packaging materials in stock to keep supplying customers with their skin care products.</p> \n"}]}

In other words, ecommerce packaging succinctly represents almost everything that a common end-user cares most about in online retail packaging solutions\u2014security, corporate image, and fair delivery prices. This also means that the ecommerce packaging design has a direct correlation with the unboxing experience of end-users as it may single-handedly make or break the consumers\u2019 expectations.</p> \n<p>That is probably why, like its ecommerce counterpart, the development of ecommerce packaging is characterized by rapid expansion. Mordor Intelligence, a global market research firm, valued the total ecommerce packaging market at USD 27.04 billion in 2020 and predicted its growth at a CAGR of 14.59% from 2021, hitting USD 61.55 billion in 2026. According toGlobeNewswire, the UK-based market intelligence provider Visiongain went one step further to forecast the ecommerce packaging market from 2020 up to 2030. It predicted that the Asia Pacific region, which is currently dominating the trade, would continue its growth momentum over these ten years.</p> \n<h2>Popular ecommerce packaging trends in 2022</h2> \n<h3>Sustainable packaging</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s no coincidence that sustainable packaging is listed among the top packaging trends in the ecommerce field now. In fact, its ability to accommodate for reduced environmental impact and help decrease ecological footprint, as defined byWikipedia, brings forth not just long-term eco-friendly solutions but also a variety of practical reasons for ecommerce business.</p> \n<p>For one thing, from a consumer behavior point of view, customers nowadays increasingly order a lot more products online, so any packaging that is reusable and recyclable to help cut their levels of waste is almost certainly welcomed. Another plausible factor is the corporate image that an ecommerce portrays. By adopting sustainable packaging, people associate the firm with being eco-conscious and at the forefront of current environmental concerns such as the climate change issue. Well-designed reusable packaging with branding also unwittingly helps to spread the word about the business.</p> \n<p>One might wonder which industries are most suitable to deploy sustainable packaging. The truth is that there is no hard and fast rule; as long as an ecommerce product can be delivered in sustainable packaging, any industry can follow this trend.

An example of minimalist packaging can be as basic as the one portrayed in the picture below:</p> \n<p>Minimalist packaging is particularly prevalent in the jewelry and beauty industries, where aesthetics are prioritized. Some fine examples of such packaging include thispaper packaging boxandanother of its alternatives, both of which focus on luxury goods such as wine, chocolate, jewelry, and other high-end items, as well as the simple elegant design displayed in the image below:</p> \n<p>In any case, while looking for minimalist packaging, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that no matter how simple or minimalistic a package is, it still needs fundamental packing essentials such asadhesive tape, package fillers, and inserts. The good news is, in line with the growing demand for sustainable packaging,environmentally friendly packaging infills, including the one shown in the picture below, are up for grabs now.</p> \n<h3>Digital printing</h3> \n<p>Digital printing is a much larger scale version of a typical digital laser orinkjet printerthat prints digital images directly from any digital storage source. It offers a much lower cost for smaller print projects and instant turnaround compared to offset printing since digital printing requires no printing plate and setup sheets.</p> \n<p>The nature of digital printing that allows quick printing for lower quantity projects makes it an ideal packaging printing method for highly personalized demands. Examples include the customizable digital printing mailer bags shown in the picture below or thiscustom design mailer bag.</p> \n<h2>A quick overview</h2> \n<p>Overall, the top three popular ecommerce packaging trends in 2022 are sustainable packaging, minimalist packaging, and digital printing.

The reason is simple: Sustainability is a key issue in this day and age, especially for young, eco-focused consumers, with many claiming they would pay up to10% morefor eco-products. Retailers and wholesalers themselves are also beginning to recognize the need for compostable packaging options, as plastic waste generation in packaging is not only harmful to the environment but will soon be heavilytaxedtoo. An example of this is the European Union, which in 2021 imposed a tax rate of\u20ac0.80 per kilogramof plastic packaging on companies.</p> \n<p>Additionally, for those making the move to becoming green, profitability can be enhanced through increased financial incentives, includinggrants from governments and independent bodies, which offer motivation to invest in energy-efficient and green technologies and products. With these incentives, both in terms of greater profits from increased consumer interest and grants, as well as from avoiding heavy taxation, the recycled packaging trend is gathering steam. Companies as large as McDonalds have even pledged to use completely renewable, recycled packaging by 2025.</p> \n<p>Overall then, consumer behavior, financial incentives, and environmental concerns are all pushing the ever-growing trend of eco-friendly packaging.

Packaging waste has become a genuine threat to us all, with some options that were previously in circulation deemedcatastrophic for the environment.</p> \n<p>Thanks to their low cost and significant environmental benefits, many distributors have been switching tocompostable plasticsin recent years. In fact, a new process discovered byresearchers at Berkeley, California in mid-2021 has enabled distributors to offer truly compostable packaging options to consumers for the very first time.</p> \n<p>However, compostable plastics are not always suitable for all types of products, due to their sometimes prohibitive cost. For this reason, many wholesalers typically usecorrugated cardboardinstead, which provides reduced cost for a minimal reduction in benefits. Additionally, industries such as bottle shipping, a market that is expected to see growth in the next few years, generally use corrugated cardboard due to its increased rigidity, allowing for protection.</p> \n<p>Here are a few other options considered safe by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC):</p> \n<p>These options, while varied, do not represent the entirety of options for those businesses seeking to provide eco-friendly packaging. It is important to note that there are other forms of sustainablepackaging available on the market. As long as the packing product is certified by the relevant sanctioning body, it can be considered eco-friendly.</p> \n<h2>How do I make sure my packaging is eco-friendly?</h2> \n<p>There are countlessecolabelson sustainable packaging. It is therefore extremely important that companies do due diligence when sourcing eco-friendly packaging materials.

This has led to optimized packaging designs, clearer labeling, and a shift toward bioplastic usage \u2014 a change that consumers seem to applaud with all their might.</p> \n<h2>Where can a business buy eco-friendly packaging wholesale?</h2> \n<p>Many forms ofbiodegradable packagingcan be found on wholesale marketplaces, as these work topromote sustainabilityand provide direct links to manufacturers across the globe. The packaging can be bought in a location where the raw material is found, which means fewer carbon emissions in transporting the raw material to the manufacturer, thereby making it even more eco-friendly and more cost-effective.</p> \n<p>Paper, for example, which is used incorrugated cardboardpackaging, can be sourced from manufacturers in the Asia Pacific, which is considered thelargest producerof this lightweight, eco-friendly packaging option. Corrugated cardboard is a rapidly growing packaging trend that businesses would be wise to adopt since its market worth is expected to double in value from 2021 to 2031 toUS$ 357 Bn.</p> \n<p>Compostable plasticsare another option for eco-friendly packaging solutions which are seeing huge growth, expected to rise from $1.6 billion in 2019 to$4.2 billion by 2027. These types of plastics can be sourced from global manufacturers and are being extensively studied in the US and the Asia Pacific. Europe accounts for thehighest revenue share, with increased demand being seen and governmental strategies being implemented. It is the LAMEA region that will see thebiggest growth in production, however, due to the presence of sugarcane feedstock.</p> \n<p>The ability to sourceeco-friendly packaging materialsfrom a variety of locations across the globe means that businesses can follow the eco trend, help combat global warming, and save money by sourcing closer to home. Additionally, a global survey showed that even as far back as 2018, 81% of respondents felt that a move towards a greener future was a strong responsibility of major companies, withyounger consumersmore likely to buy a product if they felt it was sustainable. Partly in response to this, many businesses have made moves towards sustainability and sales are booming, as shown by the increase in market value for so many of these sustainable packaging manufacturers. All of these reasons certainly make a good argument for businesses to start sourcing eco-friendly packaging.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>It is important to understand that there are profit-based reasons to go into sustainable packaging, on top of the other more obvious reasons around sustainability. Governmental pressures and incentives, such as taxation and grants, are going into effect to a greater degree globally. This means that if businesses follow the eco-packaging trend now, they can benefit from it, whereas if they wait they may lose out on grants and instead face the taxes.</p> \n<p>Additionally, growing consumer interest in eco-focused products, with polls indicating that consumers are willing to pay up to 10% more for products they consider eco-friendly, show that the additional cost a business may spend on eco-friendly packaging does not have to translate into a loss, but could in fact mean a growing customer base and higher profits.</p> \n<p>Finally, large companies are already moving into the eco-friendly packaging space, so the longer a business waits, the less interest they will attract when they do. Using eco-friendly packaging in a business today will show that your business is ahead of the curb and that it is listening to its customers. Eco-friendly packaging is the trend of today and of tomorrow.</p> \n"}]}
