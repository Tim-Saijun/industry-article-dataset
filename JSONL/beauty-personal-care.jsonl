This innovative approach not only promotes environmental health but also offers potent, natural ingredients that elevate skincare routines. For online retailers, understanding and stocking these eco-friendly products can attract conscientious consumers and boost sales. This article will explore the benefits of regeneratively farmed beauty, key trends, and how to integrate these products into your offerings.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents\u25cf Regeneratively farmed beauty explained\u25cf Benefits for the skin and the planet\u25cf Key trends in 2024\u25cf How to market regeneratively farmed beauty products</p> \n<h2>Regeneratively farmed beauty explained</h2> \n<p>Regeneratively farmed beauty products are crafted from ingredients grown using agricultural methods that restore and enhance the health of ecosystems. Unlike conventional farming, regenerative farming focuses on soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This process not only yields high-quality ingredients but also positively impacts the environment by reducing carbon footprints and improving soil fertility.</p> \n<p>The core principle of regenerative farming is to give back more than what is taken from nature. This means employing techniques like crop rotation, no-till farming, and composting. These practices help in maintaining soil structure, reducing erosion, and increasing organic matter, which leads to healthier and more resilient plants. For the beauty industry, this translates into ingredients that are not only more potent but also safer for consumers and the environment.</p> \n<p>Using regeneratively farmed ingredients in beauty products ensures that the end products are free from harmful chemicals and pesticides, making them suitable for sensitive skin. Additionally, these ingredients are often richer in essential nutrients and antioxidants, which enhance their efficacy in skincare formulations. Brands adopting this approach can position themselves as leaders in sustainability, appealing to a growing demographic of eco-conscious consumers.</p> \n<h2>Benefits for the skin and the planet</h2> \n<p>Regeneratively farmed beauty products offer a myriad of benefits both for the skin and the planet. Firstly, they are typically free from synthetic chemicals, which can cause skin irritation and long-term health issues. Instead, these products harness the power of nature, using plant-based ingredients that are gentle yet effective. For instance, regenerative farming methods often yield botanicals with higher concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing superior skincare benefits.</p> \n<p>For the planet, regenerative farming helps combat climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide in the soil. This process not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances soil fertility and water retention, leading to more resilient agricultural systems. By supporting brands that use regeneratively farmed ingredients, consumers contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.</p> \n<p>Additionally, regenerative farming promotes biodiversity. By avoiding monoculture practices and instead planting a variety of crops, these farms create habitats for wildlife, insects, and microorganisms. This biodiversity is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems and can lead to more sustainable and productive agricultural practices over time.</p> \n<p>For online retailers, promoting the environmental and health benefits of regeneratively farmed beauty products can attract a dedicated customer base. Highlighting these aspects in marketing campaigns can differentiate your offerings from competitors and align your brand with the values of sustainability and eco-consciousness.</p> \n<h2>Key trends in 2024</h2> \n<p>In 2024, several key trends are emerging within the realm of regeneratively farmed beauty products. Understanding these trends can help online retailers stay ahead of the curve and meet consumer demands effectively.</p> \n<h2>How to market regeneratively farmed beauty products</h2> \n<p>Marketing regeneratively farmed beauty products effectively involves several strategies that emphasize their unique benefits and align with consumer values.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Regeneratively farmed beauty products represent a significant shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the beauty industry. By incorporating these products into your inventory, you can attract eco-conscious consumers and contribute to a healthier planet. Embrace this trend and lead the way in promoting sustainable beauty.</p> \n"}]}

Like our skin, the scalp needs care and attention to maintain its balance. By treating your scalp to a facial, you can address issues like dandruff, dryness, and excess oil production, setting the stage for stunning hair.</p> \n<p>The scalp care market is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing consumer awareness of scalp health\u2019s importance. The global scalp care market is projected to reach approximately $20.79 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2023 to 2030\u200b (Seppic)\u200b\u200b (Coherent Insights)\u200b.

Proper scalp care can prevent issues like dandruff, dryness, and excess oil production. Neglecting your scalp is akin to ignoring the foundation of a building\u2014it leads to instability and poor performance. Ensuring a healthy scalp through regular care routines can result in stronger, more vibrant hair.</p> \n<p>A healthy scalp is characterized by clean, hydrated skin, good blood circulation, balanced oil production, and the absence of inflammation, itching, and flaking. \u201cHair is a non-essential tissue,\u201d Hill explains. \u201cWhen the body is hormonally imbalanced, nutritionally deficient, or chronically inflamed, it will begin to self-correct and redirect nutrients away from the cells that form our hair to vital organs to compensate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hair growth begins below the skin, so by the time hair protrudes from the follicle, it has already been formed. Therefore, all follicular activity\u2014both hair creation and growth\u2014requires the involvement of your scalp and its structures, Hill notes. To create an optimal environment, your scalp and hair follicles need to be kept clean, clear, and free from sebum (oil), dead skin, dandruff, or excess products.</p> \n<h2>Meet the Hero: Umberto Giannini Scalp Serum</h2> \n<p>Umberto Giannini Scalp Serum is revolutionizing scalp care with its powerful formula. Featuring Piroctone Olamine, this serum is designed to eliminate dandruff and maintain a flake-free scalp.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a key product that brings the concept of scalp facials to life, making it easy to integrate scalp health into your regular beauty routine. This serum nurtures and heals, providing a balanced and radiant scalp, which is essential for healthy hair growth.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of a Scalp Facial</h2> \n<p>A scalp facial, much like a skincare routine for the face, offers a comprehensive treatment designed to cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize the scalp, leading to numerous benefits for hair health and overall well-being. This increasingly popular treatment addresses various scalp issues, promotes healthy hair growth, and enhances the overall condition of your hair. The first step in a scalp facial involves thorough cleansing. Over time, the scalp accumulates buildup from hair products, excess oil, sweat, and environmental pollutants. This buildup can clog hair follicles, leading to issues such as dandruff, irritation, and even hair loss. By deeply cleansing the scalp, a scalp facial removes these impurities, ensuring that hair follicles remain unclogged and healthy, providing a solid foundation for hair growth.</p> \n<p>Exfoliation is another critical component of a scalp facial. Just as the skin on the face benefits from regular exfoliation, the scalp also requires this process to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. Exfoliating the scalp helps to prevent flakiness and dandruff by addressing one of their root causes\u2014accumulated dead skin. This step not only enhances the health of the scalp but also ensures that hair follicles are free from obstructions, fostering an environment conducive to robust hair growth. Moreover, exfoliation can improve blood circulation in the scalp, which is essential for delivering nutrients to hair follicles and promoting hair health.</p> \n<p>Moisturization is the next crucial step in a scalp facial. Maintaining proper moisture balance is vital for a healthy scalp. A well-moisturized scalp is less prone to dryness and irritation, which can cause itching and flakiness. On the other hand, it also prevents the scalp from becoming too oily, which can lead to greasy hair and further clogging of hair follicles. By using moisturizing treatments tailored to the scalp\u2019s needs, a scalp facial ensures that the scalp remains hydrated and balanced. This balance is critical for maintaining the scalp\u2019s natural barrier and promoting an optimal environment for hair growth.</p> \n<p>One of the significant benefits of regular scalp facials is the promotion of healthy hair growth. By keeping the scalp clean, exfoliated, and moisturized, scalp facials create a healthy environment for hair follicles. This can lead to stronger and potentially faster hair growth. Additionally, a well-maintained scalp reduces the risk of hair thinning and loss, as the follicles are less likely to be obstructed or weakened by buildup and irritation.</p> \n<p>Reducing dandruff is another notable benefit of scalp facials. Dandruff can be caused by various factors, including dry skin, excessive oil production, and fungal infections. Regular scalp facials help address these issues by maintaining the scalp\u2019s cleanliness and balance. The exfoliation process helps to remove flakes and dead skin, while moisturizing treatments prevent dryness, both of which contribute to a significant reduction in dandruff.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, scalp facials help to balance oil production on the scalp. Sebum, the natural oil produced by the scalp, is essential for keeping the hair and scalp hydrated. However, an imbalance in sebum production can lead to issues such as greasy hair or a dry, flaky scalp. Scalp facials help regulate sebum production, ensuring that the scalp is neither too dry nor too oily. This balance is crucial for maintaining a healthy scalp environment.</p> \n<p>In addition to the physical benefits, scalp facials offer a relaxing and stress-relieving experience. The process often includes a gentle massage, which can improve blood circulation, relieve tension, and promote relaxation. This aspect of scalp facials not only enhances overall well-being but also helps to reduce stress-related hair issues, such as hair thinning. By incorporating scalp facials into your hair care routine, you can address specific scalp issues, promote a healthier scalp, and consequently improve the health and appearance of your hair, leading to shinier, smoother, and more manageable locks.</p> \n<h2>Holistic Scalp Care and Overall Wellness</h2> \n<p>Embracing holistic scalp care is a commitment to overall wellness. Physical and mental health are interconnected, and a healthy scalp can contribute to your sense of well-being. Using products like Umberto Giannini Scalp Serum as part of your self-care routine not only improves your hair\u2019s health but also enhances your confidence and self-esteem. A nourished, flake-free scalp is the foundation for beautiful, resilient hair.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Scalp facials are a transformative approach to hair care, emphasizing the importance of a healthy scalp for beautiful hair. By incorporating scalp facials into your routine, you can address common scalp issues, promote hair growth, and enhance your overall well-being. As the scalp care market continues to grow, driven by consumer demand for innovative and sustainable products, now is the perfect time to invest in your scalp health. Treat your scalp to the care it deserves and enjoy the benefits of vibrant, healthy hair.</p> \n"}]}

PDT machines have therefore emerged as the best way to leverage this therapy, working wonders on skin around the world. However, given that it is such a new technology, many businesses in the beauty industry may still be unfamiliar with how exactly it works.</p> \n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll explore what makes these machines tick, why they\u2019re becoming increasingly popular among beauty-minded consumers, and how sellers can choose the right machines for their business in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are PDT machines?An overview of the PDT market in 2024The benefits of PDT machines as an aesthetic treatmentKey considerations when purchasing PDT machinesSummary</p> \n<h2>What are PDT machines?</h2> \n<p>Photodynamic therapy is a medical wonder, andPDT machinesare the best way to leverage its benefits for aesthetic purposes. These machines use light, special agents, and oxygen to zap away various skin conditions. But PDT machines don\u2019t just use any bulb; they utilize light sources that emit specific wavelengths.</p> \n<p>PDT machinestarget affected areas and conditions in a non-invasive way by destroying diseased or unwanted cells. This is one of the reasons why PDT machines are a top treatment choice for acne, actinic keratosis, and certain types of skin cancer.</p> \n<h2>An overview of the PDT market in 2024</h2> \n<p>According to data, theglobal photodynamic therapy market\u2019s global value stood at USD 4.52 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR to reach USD 8.02 billion by the end of 2030.</p> \n<p>The market owes this rapid growth to the increasing rates of skin cancer and the increasing demand for minimally invasive procedures. North America will command the highest market share over the forecast period, with the region currently accounting for 30% of the overall market share. Europe also ranks as the second-largest PDT market at 25.3%, while Asia Pacific registers as the fastest-growing region, with experts forecasting its market share to increase by approximately 20.4% over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>The benefits of PDT machines as an aesthetic treatment</h2> \n<p>PDT machinesare not just a great way to undergo photodynamic therapy; they come with several other benefits, including:</p> \n<h3>1. Versatility</h3> \n<p>PDT machines are incredibly versatile, reducing symptoms related to skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, sun damage, and precancerous lesions. This versatility makes them valuable tools for dermatologists and aesthetic practitioners, especially those looking to provide a wide range of solutions for various skincare needs.</p> \n<h3>2. Non-invasive nature</h3> \n<p>Unlike many traditional dermatological procedures, PDT machines are minimally invasive. For this reason, they are great for consumers seeking a gentler form of therapy. The absence of injections or incisions eliminates the scarring and other lasting effects related to invasive procedures.</p> \n<h3>3. Customization</h3> \n<p>The best part about PDT machines is their customizable treatments. Dermatologists and aesthetic practitioners can easily customize them to meet clients\u2019 unique needs and preferences. Most parameters (such as the special agent used, light intensity, and treatment duration) are adjustable, allowing experts to effectively tailor their services for specific skin concerns.</p> \n<h3>4. Minimal side effects</h3> \n<p>Unlike other aggressive treatments (laser therapy and surgical excision, especially), PDT machines boast minimal side effects. And while there are some common side effects related to PDT treatments (like redness, swelling, and mild discomfort), these typically resolve a few days after therapy, allowing patients to resume their normal activities in no time.</p> \n<h3>5. Collagen production stimulation</h3> \n<p>Treating existing conditions is not the only thing these machines can do \u2013 they can also stimulate collagen production, helping to improve skin texture tone and overall appearance.</p> \n<h2>Key considerations when purchasing PDT machines</h2> \n<h3>Light source</h3> \n<p>Choosing the right light source for a PDT machine is arguably the most important factor in whetherPDT treatmentsare likely to be effective or not. It\u2019s no surprise then that choosing the perfect light source requires understanding what\u2019s available. Here, we\u2019ll take a closer look at some of the main types:</p> \n<p>LED lights are commonly found inPDT machinesthanks to their ability to emit specific wavelengths and effectively target different skin conditions, especially more superficial skin problems like acne. The color of the LEDs is a factor in which treatment they\u2019re better suited to: blue light (400nm) is best for superficial concerns like acne, while red light (650nm) can travel deeper into the skin, penetrating up to 1cm for stubborn skin concerns.</p> \n<p>PDT machinesthat use laser light sources provide concentrated and intense light beams, allowing them to target specific areas or skin conditions precisely. Also, since lasers offer highly focused, intense, monochromatic light, they are ideal for treating areas below the skin\u2019s surface.</p> \n<p>Lamps are popular for being able to emit light across a broad spectrum. Although less common in modernPDT machines, lamps offer an amazing way to leverage multiple wavelengths for activating different photosensitizers (special agents). The most common lamp types include tungsten filament, xenon arc, metal halide, and fluorescent.</p> \n<h3>Photosensitizing agents</h3> \n<p>Different photosensitizing agents exist for different photodynamic therapies, each offering varying absorption spectrums and phototoxicity profiles. This relates to the way different photosensitizing agents absorb light at different wavelengths and express varying levels of toxicity when they are activated.</p> \n<p>These factors can significantly impact the treatment\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Hence, sellers must offerPDT machinesthat are compatible with various photosensitizers. Additionally, these machines should have an accurate dosing mechanism to ensure consistent and reliable treatment outcomes.</p> \n<h3>Treatment parameters</h3> \n<p>PDT machinesare usually customizable via adjustable treatment parameters like light intensity, duration, and fluence rate. Machines with adjustable parameters ensure that professionals can provide tailored treatment plans. When coupled with intuitive user interfaces and customizable presets, clinicians can provide a more streamlined and efficient treatment profile.</p> \n<h3>Safety features</h3> \n<p>As with any health-related tech, sellers must prioritizePDT machinesthat feature integrated advanced safety measures. These include built-in cooling systems to prevent overheating and discomfort during treatment, real-time dosimetry monitoring to ensure dosage delivery, and ergonomic design elements to enhance comfort.</p> \n<h2>Summary</h2> \n<p>PDT machines could be classified as a modern wonder, using light and special agents to tackle various skin issues without the need for invasive surgery procedures. Their versatility makes also them one of the best aesthetic treatment machines to stock up on in 2024. However, before doing so, sellers must take the time to research factors such as light quality, treatment agent compatibility, and safety features.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re looking for PDT machines or other cutting-edge tech solutions, browse the thousands of options onAlibaba.comtoday.</p> \n"}]}

Users are invited to step into an entire world of products and effects to create a perfect look that complements their personality, features, and skin tone. This same principle applies to lip products, where it\u2019s essential to understand the differences betweenlip stainsand lipsticks.</p> \n<p>While both products exist to beautify lips, they do differ significantly in ways that businesses must be aware of to select the right varieties for their target consumer base. Read on to dive into the differences between lip stain and lipstick in detail.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the lip makeup product market\u2019s growth forecastWhat makes lip stains and lipsticks differentLip stains vs. lipsticks: Which is the more profitable option?Summary</p> \n<h2>An overview of the lip makeup product market\u2019s growth forecast</h2> \n<p>According to the most currentlip makeup marketreport, sales of related products reached USD 2.56 billion in 2023. Experts predict this will rise a CAGR of 7.33% to reach USD 7.10 billion by 2030. The lip makeup market continues to grow because of its dynamic nature, changing according to consumers\u2019 tastes, fashion trends, and developments in cosmetic technology. While North America is the largest lip makeup market, sales in Asia Pacific are growing exponentially.</p> \n<h2>What makes lip stains and lipsticks different</h2> \n<h3>Formulation</h3> \n<p>At first glance,lip stainsand lipsticks appear similar, but each features a different formula. Unlike waxy lipsticks, lip stains mostly consist of lightweight liquids or gels. This allows the color pigments to penetrate the wearer\u2019s lips, creating a true \u201cstaining\u201d effect.</p> \n<p>The magic of long-lastinglip stainslies in their higher color pigment concentration. Manufacturers formulate these dyes to latch onto lip cells, providing vibrant colors for hours. Also, these products often have fewer emollient ingredients (like waxes and oils), making them feel slightly dry on the lips, which in some cases can benefit from the application of a lip balm for added moisture.</p> \n<p>Conversely,lipsticksachieve their creamy texture by blending waxes, oils, and emollients. For this reason, lipsticks create a more comfortable barrier that hydrates and plumps the user\u2019s lips.Lipstick formulascome in a massive variety of colors, from light to dark to shiny and matte.</p> \n<p>Lipsticks can sometimes feel more comfortable to wear as they hydrate the lips, while lip stains feel dryer and may require the addition of lip balm.</p> \n<h3>Application</h3> \n<p>Whilelip stainand lipstick applicators share some similarities, they can also have some key differences based on formula and desired application style. For example, doe-foot wands \u2013 with their flexible, tapered tips for precise control \u2013 are a common type of applicator for lip stains. They\u2019re also great for tapping and blending stains for a diffused, natural look. Otherlip stainscan simply be applied with a finger.</p> \n<p>Lipsticks, meanwhile, often come in a slanted-tip bullet form. This angled design allows easy outlining and lip filling, while the pointed end offers more precision for defining cupid bows and corners.</p> \n<p>Because of the \u201cin-built\u201d applicator of lipsticks, they are arguably easier to apply than lip stains. However, the range of lip stain applicators means that no matter the user\u2019s preference, they\u2019re likely to find a style that works for them.</p> \n<h3>Finish</h3> \n<p>Lip stainsprioritize staining power and lightweight textures, narrowing the number of finishes available. For example, it can be more difficult to achieve finishes that shimmer and shine, but matte is a practical result. Lightweight, water-based formulas usually dry into a velvety, non-shiny finish, providing a long-lasting, natural-looking stain perfect for everyday wear.</p> \n<p>Although matte is the more common finish for lip stains,someoffer a slightly satin finish with a hint of shine. These lip stains are great for consumers who don\u2019t want a flat look and prefer a touch of dimension. However, these may not be as long-lasting as matte finishes.</p> \n<p>Contrarily,lipsticksoffer various finishes, catering to a diverse range of desired effects. Check the table below for the more common lipstick finish types:</p> \n<p>Lipsticks offer more finish options than lip stains, where matte lip stains remain the most practical.</p> \n<h3>Removal</h3> \n<p>Lipstainsare harder to remove than lipsticks because of the higher color pigment concentration that penetrates the user\u2019s top skin layer. Oil-based makeup removers and micellar water with oil molecules can be used to effectively remove lip stains. Natural oils like coconut and olive work, too, but require rubbing with cotton pads or washcloths.</p> \n<p>Lipsticksare easier to remove thanlip stainsoverall. Regular makeup removers will work for most of them, except long-wear formulas.Matte lipsticksmay be more stubborn, but creamy varieties will come off easily with makeup removers or micellar water.</p> \n<p>Lipsticks tend to be easier to remove than lip stains overall due to the latter\u2019s deeper penetration of the user\u2019s lips.</p> \n<h2>Lip stains vs. lipsticks: Which is the more profitable option?</h2> \n<p>Based on consumer interest, lipsticks have the upper hand over lip stains when it comes to profitability. Google Ads stats show that in March 2024, there were 1.2 million searches for lipsticks versus 301,000 searches for lip stains during the same period.</p> \n<h2>Summary</h2> \n<p>In 2024, both lip stains and lipsticks offer a viable sales prospect for those in the cosmetics industry. The key is researching the best products for your consumer base and knowing which product achieves different looks for a variety of occasions.</p> \n<p>While lipsticks have higher search interest than lip stains, it would be beneficial to offer both so as to attract a broader range of customers.

These makeup removers emulsify with water to provide deep-cleansing properties, which can tackle even the most stubborn makeup easily.</p> \n<p>However,cleansing oilsoffer the best results in a double-cleansing routine. After gently massaging these oils, ladies must rinse them off with water and follow up with facial cleansers\u2014so these makeup removers are not travel-friendly.</p> \n<p>Although they can remove heavy makeup,cleansing oilshave a catch. They can rob the skin of its natural moisture. Hence, sellers must choose formulations and ingredients suitable for their target consumer\u2019s skin.</p> \n<h3>Cleansing balm</h3> \n<p>Cleansing balmsare similar to their oil cousins. However, they come in a solid form before melting into an oily structure after application.</p> \n<p>And unlike cleansing oils, balms do not strip all the natural moisture away. Instead, they\u2019ll leave the skin feeling soft while removing makeup and dirt. Hence, it\u2019s no surprise that they get an averaged 5,400 queries on Google monthly.</p> \n<p>Since they\u2019re moisturizing in nature,cleansing balmsare also compatible with all skin types. They have no business with skin pores so that oily-skinned consumers can use them as their go-to makeup removers.</p> \n<h3>Cleansing foams</h3> \n<p>These are also water-based makeup removers.They comewith surfactants to help create a foamy lather for effective makeup removal. Since consumers mix them with water before use, they have an easier time lifting dirt and makeup from the face.</p> \n<p>Cleansing foams, with their decent 50 search queries every month, are the best cleansers for oily and acne-prone skin, as their lather can also remove excess moisture. However, they may be too harsh for dry-skinned consumers\u2014it will leave their skin parched, making following up with a moisturizer compulsory.</p> \n<h2>Important aspects to prioritize when selecting makeup removers in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Stock based on the target skin type</h3> \n<p>After consumers choose their preferred makeup remover, formulation is the next thing they\u2019ll consider. And they make this decision based on their skin type. Here\u2019s a walkthrough of the different skin types and makeup remover formula requirements:</p> \n<h3>What\u2019s the target\u2019s lifestyle?</h3> \n<p>The consumer\u2019s lifestyle also plays a huge role in determining their perfect makeup remover. They\u2019ll consider things like: \u201cWhere and when will I remove my makeup?\u201d \u201cWould I need cotton pads?\u201d Or \u201cIs access to a sink necessary.\u201d Here\u2019s how these questions help determine the most ideal makeup removers.</p> \n<p>If consumers prefer quickly wiping off their makeup, especially when on the go, makeup remover wipes are a no-brainer. They\u2019re the most convenient choice for this lifestyle due to their use-and-discard nature.</p> \n<p>What if women are at home but still don\u2019t want the hassle of full-blown make removal routines? They\u2019ll see low-effort micellar water as the most efficient way to wipe their makeup\u2014and they\u2019ll be ready to buy those extra cotton pads.</p> \n<p>Now, not everyone loves the quick and easy life. Some consumers prefer indulging in complete skincare rituals at home. Usually, they\u2019re also ready to take the consequences of applying full or high-coverage makeup. Therefore, such consumers move toward cleansing oils and balms.</p> \n<h3>Eye makeup removal is a different ball game</h3> \n<p>Removing eye makeup requires something different. The area around the eyes is more sensitive than the face and body, so ladies must use other products if they don\u2019t want to irritate it.</p> \n<p>More importantly, eye makeup (like waterproof eyeliner and mascara) is usually long-lasting and notorious for being difficult to remove. Sellers hoping to attract this niche must focus on a different product: eye and lip makeup remover.</p> \n<p>Eye and lip makeup removers can easily remove difficult makeup from these sensitive areas without damaging the delicate skin. Most have bi-phase formulas featuring oily and aqueous layers, allowing them to tackle waterproof or heavy eye makeup.</p> \n<h3>Avoid harsh ingredients</h3> \n<p>Many makeup removers have alcohol as one of their main ingredients. Alcohol easily breaks down makeup\u2019s tough chemical composition, so most people would think it\u2019s a great ingredient for these products. Unfortunately, continuously using alcohol-based removers can damage the skin, so it\u2019s safer for businesses to avoid selling them.</p> \n<p>Fragrances and preservatives are another big no. Although fragrances make makeup removers more attractive (who wouldn\u2019t want a burst of nice scents?), they can irritate sensitive skin and cause allergic reactions.</p> \n<p>Fragrance-free removers are also recommended for target consumers with acne. This will avoid irritating the skin and causing more issues. Although people without sensitive skin can use products with fragrances, the recent trend says the purer, the better!</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Makeup removers should help remove tough makeup, not add more problems to the consumer\u2019s face. That\u2019s why consumers don\u2019t just choose any makeup remover they see on shelves or in online stores.</p> \n<p>Although women are now more conscious of their purchases, businesses can stay ahead of them by understanding their needs for stocking up. Think about the target consumer\u2019s lifestyle and skin type before marketing offers to them.</p> \n<p>Remember to avoid makeup removers with harsh ingredients and offer different products for stubborn eye makeup. Following these tips will increase the chances of attracting consumers interested in makeup removers in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Consumers are actively seeking holistic treatments that not only enhance their wellbeing but also indirectly improve skin quality. From IV drips combating fatigue to aesthetic treatments in wellness spas, this trend is gaining momentum. This article explores how these innovative practices are being integrated into beauty routines and the rising interest in holistic skincare solutions.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents\u25cf The rise of IV drip therapies\u25cf Wellness spas and aesthetic treatments\u25cf Alternative therapies in skincare\u25cf Integrating wellness hacking into product offerings\u25cf The influence of NAD+ in beauty products</p> \n<h3>The rise of IV drip therapies</h3> \n<p>In response to the modern epidemic of stress and fatigue, IV drip therapies have emerged as a popular wellness hack in the beauty industry. Clinics such as NADclinic in London are at the forefront, offering bespoke IV treatments like NAD+ and glutathione drips designed to combat fatigue and improve overall wellbeing. These treatments provide a direct infusion of nutrients, making them more effective than traditional supplements.</p> \n<p>The popularity of IV drips is partly due to their ability to offer immediate results, including enhanced energy, better hydration, and improved skin appearance. Consumers appreciate these quick wellness boosts that also contribute to long-term skin health by detoxifying and replenishing essential vitamins and antioxidants. As this trend continues to grow, it represents a significant opportunity for beauty businesses to integrate wellness into their service offerings, potentially partnering with clinics or developing at-home IV-like supplements that cater to the health-conscious consumer.</p> \n<h3>Wellness spas and aesthetic treatments</h3> \n<p>Wellness spas are evolving beyond traditional relaxation treatments to incorporate aesthetic enhancements that leverage cutting-edge biohacking techniques. An exemplar of this trend is Dr. Vali\u2019s 360 Experiential Centre located in London\u2019s Selfridges, which merges medical science with holistic wellness to enhance mental and physical health. Treatments at such centers typically focus on improving focus, sleep, and energy levels, with a strong emphasis on enhancing skin quality.</p> \n<p>This holistic approach appeals to consumers who seek comprehensive solutions in one setting. The success of these spas indicates a shift towards multifunctional wellness environments where beauty and health are intertwined, providing ample opportunities for beauty brands to collaborate with wellness centers. By adopting similar biohacking strategies, beauty brands can create innovative products that mimic the effects of these spa treatments, such as skincare that improves sleep quality or enhances mental clarity.</p> \n<h3>Alternative therapies in skincare</h3> \n<p>Interest in alternative therapies and mystical practices is influencing the beauty industry, driving brands like Lush to integrate these elements into their products and services. Lush\u2019s approach includes a spa menu that combines relaxation techniques with a touch of mysticism, appealing to consumers drawn to novel and holistic experiences. This trend is fueled by a wider acceptance of diverse cultural practices and the rising curiosity about ancestral knowledge and its applications in modern wellness.</p> \n<p>As consumers become more open to exploring different wellness philosophies, there is a growing market for products that incorporate these alternative beliefs into their formulations. For example, using ingredients known for their spiritual significance or incorporating rituals that enhance the user\u2019s emotional and physical wellbeing. This trend offers beauty brands a unique angle to differentiate their products in a crowded market by embracing cultural heritage and alternative health practices.</p> \n<h3>Integrating wellness hacking into product offerings</h3> \n<p>To effectively tap into the wellness hacking trend, beauty brands should consider how to replicate the spa experience in consumer homes. This involves developing products that not only cater to basic skincare needs but also provide an enhanced sensory experience. Products like at-home light therapy devices, massage applicator tools, and hedonistic scents can transform routine beauty treatments into luxurious, restorative experiences.</p> \n<p>These products should aim to titillate the senses while providing tangible health benefits, such as improved skin tone, relaxation, and better sleep quality. By offering these innovative products, brands can cater to the growing demand for at-home wellness solutions that are both effective and indulgent. Marketing these products as part of a larger wellness routine can help brands connect with consumers on a deeper level, promoting a holistic approach to beauty and health.</p> \n<h3>The influence of NAD+ in beauty products</h3> \n<p>NAD+, a coenzyme found in all living cells, is becoming a star ingredient in the beauty industry due to its role in cellular health and regeneration. With its proven benefits in boosting energy levels and reducing signs of aging, NAD+ has captured the attention of both consumers and professionals in the beauty market. As a result, there is a significant rise in the availability of NAD-infused at-home supplements and skincare products.</p> \n<p>These products promise to harness the regenerative powers of NAD+ to improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and enhance skin brightness. The trend towards incorporating scientific advancements into beauty regimens is growing, and NAD+ is at the forefront, offering a potent blend of science-backed benefits that appeal to health-conscious consumers. Beauty brands that invest in developing and marketing NAD+-infused products can gain a competitive edge by meeting the demands of consumers looking for high-efficacy, scientifically proven skincare solutions.</p> \n<p>The integration of wellness hacking into the beauty industry represents a significant shift towards holistic health solutions, driven by growing consumer demands for products that enhance both appearance and overall wellbeing. Innovations such as IV drip therapies, wellness spas, and alternative skincare treatments reflect a market increasingly focused on comprehensive health benefits. The rise of ingredients like NAD+ highlights a trend towards products that combine efficacy with luxury, appealing to consumers seeking deep, impactful wellness benefits. For industry professionals, embracing these trends is crucial to attract a discerning consumer base and foster brand loyalty. Wellness hacking is not just a trend but a fundamental shift in the beauty industry, blending health with aesthetics to meet modern consumer preferences. This evolution presents vast opportunities for innovation and growth, marking a future where beauty and wellness are inextricably linked.</p> \n"}]}

As a result, eye massagers are gaining incredible momentum as a solution to handle the strain popular with too much screen time.</p> \n<p>For this reason, theglobal eye massage equipment marketis recording significant growth. According to experts, the market grew to US$ 17.57 million in 2024 from US$ 16.41 million in 2023. But, forecasts suggest a steady growth to US$ 26.74 million by 2030 at a 7.21% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). North America is also the dominant region in the eye massage equipment market due to changing lifestyles and rapid adoption necessitating such purchases.</p> \n<h2>Why do consumers want eye massagers?</h2> \n<p>Everyone depends on smartphones, laptops, and computers for office work, school assignments, or entertainment. In truth, using them has become a daily necessity, with many consumers using them for extended periods. But many often fail to realize the immense strain and pressure using screens puts on the eyes.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the more time consumers spend on screens, the more strained eyes will feel. And a good night\u2019s sleep may not be enough to rest the eyes properly. With more consumers now understanding the importance of eye health, they demand eye massages to give the eyes the relaxation they deserve.</p> \n<p>Consumers also flock to eye massagers because they help relieve eye strain, improve dark circles, and combat puffiness. They also come in handy for people suffering from temple pressure, facial pain, headaches, and insomnia. If consumers want to enhance their overall eye health, these products are for them!</p> \n<h2>Types of eye massagers</h2> \n<p>Eye massagers are not universal. They come in different designs and use various technologies to give the eyes a relaxing experience. So, sellers must understand the different types of products before choosing these awesome ones. Here is a look at four of the most common ones:</p> \n<h3>Heat eye massagers</h3> \n<p>Theseeye massagersare the most affordable types. They use heat to loosen muscles around the eyes and increase massage effectiveness.Heat eye massagersare also the best option for handling dark circles and inflammation. However, they can\u2019t do more than help solve issues on the skin\u2019s surface. The deeper the problem, the less effective heat eye massagers become.</p> \n<h3>Wearable eye massagers</h3> \n<p>Someeye massagerscan become uncomfortable if consumers wear them for long. But not these bad boys. Manufacturers build wearable eye massagers for longer sessions. Although they look like skin musks, these massagers boast larger frames decked with cushioning to prevent potential irritation.</p> \n<p>Wearable eye massagersare also popular for their multiple heat settings, offering more massage intensities and effectiveness than other types. But there\u2019s a catch: manufacturers trade off portability and travel-friendliness for their extended wear time.</p> \n<h3>Infrared eye massagers</h3> \n<p>If consumers want to do more than relax their eye skin\u2019s surface, they\u2019ll opt forinfrared eyemassagers. In addition to improving eye health, these awesome devices increase blood flow, resulting in better vision and helping to handle inflammation. Unlike regular heat massagers,infrared modelsreach deep into the skin to soften the entire muscle tissue.</p> \n<h3>Vibration and pressure eye massagers</h3> \n<p>These massagersemploy a fine, gentle vibrating movement to deliver a soothing massage to the eye area. Their trembling movement is great for promoting relaxation and reducing tension. On the other hand,pressure massagersuse pressured air or water to provide gentle eye massage experiences. They can also relieve fatigue and stimulate blood circulation.</p> \n<h2>Amazing features to look out for when adding eye massagers to inventories</h2> \n<h3>Comfort</h3> \n<p>Aneye massagerwould be useless to consumers if it\u2019s uncomfortable. So, to avoid consumers requesting returns, sellers must prioritize choosing eye massagers to offer maximum comfort. Generally, they should be soft and lightweight while featuring materials that won\u2019t irritate consumers.</p> \n<p>Sellers can also ensure their chosen massagers come from special silicone. Currently, they\u2019re the safest options available. Remember to select models with padding around their edges. This feature is like a pillow, allowing massagers to rest comfortably on the user\u2019s face.</p> \n<h3>Custom settings & additional features</h3> \n<p>Want to keep consumers\u2019 attention and get them to buy? Go for massagers with all sorts of features and settings\u2014those are the best!Such eye massagersput the experience in the hands of the users, allowing them to customize the massage experience, type, pressure, and much more. Nothing beats enjoying a personalized experience.</p> \n<p>Some eye massagers even offer built-in speakers so consumers can play their favorite tunes while receiving eye pampering. The more features and customizations eye massagers have, the more attractive they\u2019ll be to consumers, especially when they\u2019re looking for high-end models.</p> \n<h3>Power source</h3> \n<p>Electrical eye massagers can use two power sources: replaceable or rechargeable batteries. Choosing between these types depends on consumers\u2019 usage frequency. Eye massagers with rechargeable batteries are the best options for consumers wanting frequent eye massages. It\u2019ll save them the cost (and stress) of replacing batterings every three or two weeks.</p> \n<p>Conversely, consumers who don\u2019t useeye massagersfrequently can use replaceable batteries. Since rechargeable eye massagers take some time to get full power, they\u2019ll get a more instant operation with replaceable variants. But if they still want rechargeable eye massagers, models with small interfaces displaying battery power will be handy.</p> \n<p>Note: Smaller eye massagers use batteries that last around 15 minutes, while the bigger ones can operate up to 60 minutes.</p> \n<h3>Size and design</h3> \n<p>Someeye massagersfeature foldable and portable designs, while others have more robust designs. However, this size and design variety allows consumers to choose the best ones for their massage experience. However, the bigger and more robust ones are often medical-grade quality, which is also the most expensive.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that not everyone feels comfortable with big-eye massagers. Some robust models may weigh way more than smaller ones (because of all the technology they pack), creating more issues during longer sessions. Still, it depends on what consumers want. If they wish to have massage sessions wherever they go, foldable designs would be better. But more robust ones will appeal to them if they don\u2019t mind the extra weight.</p> \n<h3>Adjustable vs. elastic headband</h3> \n<p>Headbands also play a huge role in eye massager comfort. Businesses canoffer massagerswith adjustable headbands if they want the most comfortable experience. Consumers can easily customize them regardless of their head shape or size.</p> \n<p>In contrast, elastic headbands need some breaking in for consumers to get comfortable. They start too strong, making the headbands push too tightly on the face. While it feels uncomfortable initially, these headbands will eventually conform to the user\u2019s head for the perfect fit.</p> \n<h2>Tips to know before selling eye massagers in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Don\u2019t underestimate manual massagers</h3> \n<p>Not everyone is tech-savvy enough to use electric eye massagers. If consumers want the simplest way to alleviate their eye strain and stress, they\u2019ll demand manual massagers. Usually, these massagers come with a 360-degree rolling ball head, giving consumers a soothing and comfortable eye massage without all the tech mumbo jumbo.</p> \n<p>Note: Manual massagers can also soothe the skin naturally, helping consumers look younger and more vibrant.</p> \n<h3>Understand the safety precautions of eye massagers first</h3> \n<p>Although eye massagers are 100% safe, certain consumers can\u2019t use them. So, businesses must avoid offering eye massagers to consumers suffering from retina conditions, diabetes, cataracts, and eye infections/injuries\u2014especially when they don\u2019t have the go-ahead from their eye physician.</p> \n<h3>Go for eye massagers with a handheld remote</h3> \n<p>Remote controls add an extra layer of comfort to the eye massager experience. Such models allow consumers to make quick adjustments while receiving their messages. Remote controls will make it easy to increase or decrease massage intensity, pressure, music volume, or switch tunes.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Eye massagersare simply amazing! They\u2019re the go for getting that much-needed rejuvenation after a long at work or adding some eye pampering to beauty routines. And it\u2019s not all talk either\u2014these products are rapidly gaining popularity, and Google data proves it. Interest in eye massagers has risen by over 70%, from 60,500 in 2023 to 111,000 searches in January 2024! A huge and growing audience is waiting for this product\u2014so businesses can use this guide to grab the best eye massagers and ensure irresistible offers in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

From being a mere accessory, scents are now seen as integral components of personal storytelling, expressing one\u2019s emotions, style, and cultural background. This shift towards personalized fragrances represents a significant evolution in the perfume industry, influenced heavily by social trends and technological advancements. The North American perfume market, valued at $6.6 billion in 2023, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.8% from 2024 to 2032, reaching $8.5 billion. This growth is driven by increased consumer spending on beauty and personal care products. There\u2019s a notable shift towards a variety of fragrances over single signature scents, especially among younger consumers, boosting demand for both premium and mass-market products.

Traditionally viewed as a means to appeal to others, the use of perfume has transformed into a medium for personal gratification and expression. This trend is particularly prominent among Gen Z, who explore and redefine their identities through the art of scent layering.</p> \n<p>By combining various fragrances, they create unique olfactory profiles that represent their individual feelings, cultural heritage, and personal journeys. This practice not only allows for a highly personalized scent experience but also encourages a form of olfactory creativity that had not been mainstream before. As this trend continues to evolve, it challenges the perfume industry to think beyond conventional fragrance production and cater to a growing demand for customization and uniqueness in scent choices.</p> \n<h2>The role of social media in fragrance discovery</h2> \n<p>In the digital age, social media platforms have become pivotal in shaping consumer behaviors and trends, particularly in the realm of fragrance discovery. With over 11 billion views, the hashtag #PerfumeTok on TikTok exemplifies the significant impact of social media on the perfume industry.</p> \n<p>This platform has not only democratized fragrance discovery but has also introduced users to contemporary fragrance brands, culture-led ingredients, and innovative concepts such as \u201cscent hacking.\u201d Scent hacking involves the strategic use of fragrances to enhance mood and emotional well-being, reflecting a more proactive approach to the use of perfume in daily life.</p> \n<p>Additionally, social media has facilitated a dialogue around the cultural significance of various scents, enabling a deeper understanding and appreciation of fragrances tied to specific locales and traditions. This engagement is transforming how new generations perceive and consume perfumes, steering them towards more personalized, meaningful olfactory experiences.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, social media encourages a culture of experimentation among fragrance enthusiasts. Influencers and content creators on these platforms often discuss and demonstrate the layering of scents or introduce lesser-known brands, which has empowered consumers to explore beyond traditional fragrances and create personalized scent experiences. This trend is also driven by the visual and community-oriented nature of social media, where users share their fragrance collections and application techniques, and engage in discussions about the latest trends and innovations\u200b (FragranceInsiders.com)\u200b\u200b (Highsnobiety)\u200b.</p> \n<p>The shift towards digital platforms for fragrance discovery is backed by significant numbers.

Advances in this field are enabling brands to tailor scents based on individual neurological responses, thus enhancing the personal connection between scent and identity.</p> \n<p>This scientific approach takes into consideration how different olfactory notes can trigger varied emotional and psychological responses. For instance, certain scents might evoke a sense of calm or alertness, providing not just a sensory pleasure but also a therapeutic benefit. As research progresses, the potential for creating signature scents that are uniquely aligned with an individual\u2019s emotional and psychological state is becoming more tangible. This approach not only deepens the user\u2019s personal relationship with their fragrance but also redefines the role of scents in daily life as tools for emotional and mental wellness.</p> \n<p>The evolving landscape of the fragrance industry underscores a broader cultural shift towards individuality and personal expression. As consumers, particularly younger generations, increasingly seek authenticity and personal relevance in their products, fragrances are transforming from mere accessories into essential elements of personal identity. The role of social media has been instrumental in this transformation, providing a platform for innovative scent discovery and community engagement around perfumes. Furthermore, the integration of neuroscience into perfumery promises a future where fragrances are not only personalized but also deeply intertwined with emotional and psychological well-being. Together, these developments signify a new era in perfumery, where the power of scent goes beyond aesthetics to become a dynamic tool for personal expression and emotional health. As we look forward, the fragrance industry is poised to continue breaking traditional molds, guided by technological advancements and a deeper understanding of the human olfactory connection.</p> \n"}]}

Even better, businesses can offer them to spas or for at-home experiences. Keep reading to discover five amazing slimming machine trends to stock up on in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the global slimming machine market5 slimming machines trends to know in 2024Rounding up</p> \n<h2>An overview of the global slimming machine market</h2> \n<p>Slimming machines have become a great alternative to procedures like liposuction. Hence, forecasts suggest theglobal slimming machinemarket will grow at a 6.06% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2028, reaching a value of US$ 4.235 billion. The global slimming machine market owes its growth to the surging obese population and the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and orthopedic issues caused by said obesity.</p> \n<p>Other factors contributing to the market\u2019s growth include a rise in health consciousness among people and improved digitization, which ensures easy access to information. Regionally, North America leads the slimming machine market due to its high population of overweight and obese people. Experts say Asia Pacific will witness the highest growth over the forecast period (2021 to 2028).</p> \n<h2>5 slimming machines trends to know in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Radiofrequency (RF) machines</h3> \n<p>Dieting and exercising can help reduce body fat. However, some consumers may have unwanted fat pockets that remain stubborn despite their weight reduction activities. Such consumers can use thisnon-invasive slimming treatmentto get that dream body.</p> \n<p>RF slimming machineshelp target unwanted fat by safely generating heat. This safe heat enters deep into the skin, forcing fat cells to break down and release liquid fat. The results? The shrinking and contracting of these fat cells. For this reason, radiofrequency machines are a great way to achieve slimmer and more contoured figures.</p> \n<p>In addition to melting fat pockets,RF machinesare also popular forskin tightening, as the therapy pushes the skin to produce more elastin and collagen. Radiofrequency\u2019s safe and noninvasive design is the sole reason for its popularity. Consumers only feel a gentle vibration during treatment\u2014with no pain or discomfort. Radiofrequency machines raked in 6,600 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Ultrasound cavitation machines</h3> \n<p>If radiofrequency is not one\u2019s cup of tea, they can turn toultrasound cavitation machines. These aesthetic devices use ultrasound technology to destroy fat cells under the skin. If cellulite and localized fat are the major concerns, ultrasound cavitation machines may be the best solution.</p> \n<p>But how doesultrasound technologywork? Instead of generating heat, ultrasound cavitation machines use vibrations to pressurize fat cells. This intense pressure forcefully breaks down the targeted fat cells, liquifying them for the body to dispose of. These broken-down fat cells travel from the body to the liver before the body excretes them through urine.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s more. Consumers can easily customize their slimming session according to their needs. However, the duration for each treatment may be longer for some than for others. More importantly, consumers can expect to see results from these bad boys in 6 to 12 weeks.Ultrasound cavitation machinesare also popular, drawing 12,100 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Cryolipolysis machines</h3> \n<p>Have some consumers tried RF and ultrasound therapies but still complain about stubborn fat pockets? Then, it\u2019s time to look atcryolipolysis machines. These machines work in an entirely different way. Instead of vibrations or frequencies, cryolipolysis machines inject special liquid (usually nitrogen) into fat cells, destroying them fast. These slimming machines can help consumers get that toned body in at least two months!</p> \n<p>The amount of damage these machines can do to fat cells depends on how much weight the person has and how often they exercise. In addition, twocryolipolysis machinetypes currently exist on the market. The first one is portable cryolipolysis machines. They are the best options for at-home use (though some spas still use them) and can handle various weight ranges from very heavy to easy, light exercises.</p> \n<p>The second type is commercial models with table tops and LCD screens. Thesecryolipolysis machinesare more convenient for offices or gyms, as consumers have enough space to relax while the machine does its thing. Here\u2019s one more fact: the cooling sensation from this aesthetic treatment can also help soothe tired muscles burdened by all that excess fat. Cryolipolysis machines will also help improve skin appearance. These slimming machines got 49500 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<p>Note: These machines allow the dead fat cells to leave the body through the lymphatic system.</p> \n<h3>Laser lipolysis machines</h3> \n<p>If consumers don\u2019t like the cooling feeling of cryolipolysis machines but still want an effective solution, laser lipolysis variants may be their best option. Instead of killing cells like their cryo cousins,laser lipo machinesbore holes into fat cells for the fatty liquid to leak, allowing the body to flush them through the lymphatic system naturally.</p> \n<p>So, the cells won\u2019t die here but shrink to the point they are indistinguishable from healthy lean cells. The shrunken fat cells will trigger a chain reaction, prompting other fat cells to release their contents and adopt a healthy, lean lifestyle.Laser lipo machineswill easily train fat cells to behave differently without excessive cooling, vibrations, and heat.</p> \n<p>The best part is consumers can start seeing improvements after the first session. The results fromlaser lipowill last as long as consumers adopt a healthier lifestyle (like their fat cells). Laser lipolysis machines are even more popular than cryolipolysis machines. They garnered 135,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Vacuum therapy machines</h3> \n<p>Remember those suction cups used to enlarge lips? Imagine that, but for dealing with excess fat\u2014that is the perfect description for vacuum therapy machines.These pieces of equipmentuse suction to drain adipose tissues, moving the fat toward the lymphatic system for excretion. In addition to handling unwanted fat, vacuum therapy machines offer exfoliating effects, making the skin more elastic and relaxing muscles.</p> \n<p>If consumers also want skincare benefits, sellers can find models merged with radiofrequency and LED light energy. It\u2019ll help target fat faster while improving skin appearance. Generally, consumers will need 12 to 15 sessions with this machine, but results will start showing on the seventh one.Vacuum therapy machinesattracted 14,800 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>With the obese and overweight population steadily rising, many people are searching for more effective, faster, and safer ways to lose all their unwanted fat. While nothing tops cutting down calories and exercising, some machines can help speed up the process and can help consumers to get their dream body. Businesses can sell these slimming machines to spas, beauty salons, and gyms or target at-home users with portable versions. Regardless of what retailers choose, these are the five slimming machine trends worth purchasing in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Get ready to dive into the world of exosomes \u2013 tiny powerhouses that are set to revolutionize the industry by 2025. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the science behind these fascinating vesicles, their potential benefits for skin, and why they\u2019re generating so much buzz among skincare experts. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned beauty aficionado or just starting to build your routine, understanding the exosome opportunity is key to staying ahead of the curve. So sit back, relax, and let\u2019s uncover the secrets of this game-changing ingredient together.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents1. What are exosomes?2. How exosomes benefit skin3. The science supporting exosomes4. Exosome beauty products5. The future of exosomes in beauty</p> \n<h2>What are exosomes?</h2> \n<p>Exosomes are tiny vesicles that are naturally secreted by cells in the body. These microscopic messengers, ranging from 30 to 150 nanometers in size, were once thought to be nothing more than cellular waste disposal units. However, recent research has shed light on their true purpose and potential.</p> \n<p>Scientists have discovered that exosomes play a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication. They carry a variety of cargo, including proteins, lipids, and genetic material, which can be delivered to recipient cells to influence their behavior. This unique ability has caught the attention of skincare experts, who are now exploring the potential of exosomes in beauty products.</p> \n<p>When applied topically, exosomes have shown promise in delivering beneficial compounds directly to skin cells. They can transport growth factors, antioxidants, and other nutrients that help to nourish and rejuvenate the skin. This targeted delivery system is what sets exosomes apart from other skincare ingredients, as they can penetrate deeper into the skin and provide more effective results.</p> \n<p>As research continues to uncover the full potential of exosomes, it\u2019s becoming clear that these tiny vesicles are more than just a passing trend. They represent a new frontier in skincare, offering a way to harness the body\u2019s own natural processes to promote healthier, more youthful-looking skin.</p> \n<h2>How exosomes benefit skin</h2> \n<p>Exosomes have emerged as a promising solution for those seeking to improve the appearance and health of their skin. These tiny vesicles have been shown to offer a wide range of benefits, thanks to their ability to deliver essential compounds directly to skin cells.</p> \n<p>One of the most exciting potential benefits of exosomes is their ability to stimulate collagen production. Collagen is a crucial protein that helps to keep skin firm, plump, and youthful-looking. As we age, our body\u2019s natural collagen production decreases, leading to the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin. By delivering growth factors and other nutrients to skin cells, exosomes can help to boost collagen synthesis, resulting in a more youthful and radiant complexion.</p> \n<p>In addition to promoting collagen production, exosomes have also been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is a key contributor to many skin concerns, including acne, redness, and sensitivity. By reducing inflammation, exosomes can help to soothe and calm irritated skin, promoting a more even and balanced complexion.</p> \n<p>Exosomes may also play a role in enhancing skin hydration and strengthening the skin\u2019s natural barrier function. By delivering essential lipids and other nutrients to the skin, exosomes can help to lock in moisture and prevent transepidermal water loss. This can result in skin that feels softer, smoother, and more supple, with a healthy, dewy glow.</p> \n<h2>The science supporting exosomes</h2> \n<p>The buzz surrounding exosomes in the skincare industry is not merely hype; it\u2019s backed by a growing body of scientific research. While studies on the application of exosomes in skincare are relatively new, the results so far have been promising.</p> \n<p>Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of exosomes to stimulate collagen production in skin cells. One such study, published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, found that exosomes derived from human adipose stem cells could increase type I collagen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts by more than 30%. This suggests that topical application of exosomes could be an effective way to boost collagen levels in the skin, leading to a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p> \n<p>Clinical trials have also shown the potential benefits of exosome-based skincare products. A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology investigated the effects of a topical exosome product on crow\u2019s feet wrinkles. After 12 weeks of use, participants showed significant improvements in wrinkle depth and skin elasticity. Another clinical trial, published in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, found that an exosome-containing cream could enhance skin hydration and firmness, as well as reduce the appearance of pores.</p> \n<p>As research into the skincare applications of exosomes continues, experts predict that the evidence supporting their use will only grow stronger. With their unique ability to deliver targeted benefits to the skin, exosomes are poised to become a major player in the beauty industry in the years to come.</p> \n<h2>Exosome beauty products</h2> \n<p>As the science behind exosomes continues to advance, more and more beauty brands are beginning to incorporate these powerful vesicles into their product formulations. Currently, the majority of exosome-based skincare products on the market are derived from stem cells, which are known to be particularly rich sources of exosomes.</p> \n<p>Exosome beauty products come in a variety of forms, including serums, essences, creams, and masks. These products are designed to be used as part of a regular skincare routine, with most brands recommending once or twice-daily application for optimal results. When choosing an exosome-based product, it\u2019s important to look for formulations that are transparent about their stem cell source and manufacturing processes, as this can help to ensure quality and safety.</p> \n<p>One of the key advantages of exosome beauty products is their versatility. Because exosomes are able to deliver a wide range of beneficial compounds to the skin, they can be formulated to target specific skincare concerns, such as fine lines, uneven texture, or dehydration. This makes them a promising option for those looking to address multiple skin issues with a single product.</p> \n<p>As awareness of the potential benefits of exosomes continues to grow, it\u2019s likely that more and more beauty brands will begin to incorporate these innovative ingredients into their product lines. With their ability to promote youthful, radiant skin, exosome-based skincare products are poised to become a staple in beauty routines around the world in the coming years.</p> \n<h2>The future of exosomes in beauty</h2> \n<p>As the beauty industry continues to evolve, exosomes are emerging as a key player in the future of skincare. Many experts predict that by 2025, exosomes will be one of the most sought-after ingredients in the beauty market, thanks to their unique ability to deliver targeted benefits to the skin.</p> \n<p>One of the most exciting potential developments in exosome technology is the use of plant-derived exosomes. While most current exosome products are derived from animal stem cells, researchers are beginning to explore the possibilities of using exosomes from plant sources, such as fruits and flowers. These plant-based exosomes could offer a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to animal-derived ingredients, while still delivering powerful skincare benefits.</p> \n<p>Another area of focus for the future of exosomes in beauty is the development of more advanced delivery systems. By encapsulating exosomes in specialized carriers, such as liposomes or hydrogels, skincare brands may be able to enhance their stability and penetration into the skin. This could lead to even more effective and targeted skincare products that are able to address a wide range of concerns, from aging to acne.</p> \n<p>As research into the potential applications of exosomes in skincare continues to advance, it\u2019s clear that these tiny vesicles hold immense promise for the future of the beauty industry. With their ability to promote youthful, radiant, and healthy-looking skin, exosomes are set to become a go-to ingredient for skincare enthusiasts and beauty brands alike in the years to come.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In conclusion, exosomes represent a new frontier in skincare, offering a powerful and innovative way to address a wide range of skin concerns. With their ability to deliver targeted benefits and promote youthful, radiant skin, exosomes are poised to become a major player in the beauty industry in the coming years. As research continues to uncover the full potential of these tiny vesicles, skincare enthusiasts can look forward to a new generation of products that harness the power of exosomes to transform the health and appearance of their skin. Whether you\u2019re a beauty aficionado or simply looking for the best ways to care for your skin, exosomes are definitely an ingredient to watch.</p> \n"}]}

On the other hand, reports suggest Europe will be the second-largest regional market, with predictions showing it will grow at a 4.3% CAGR. In addition, soft wax machines are also the dominant type and will maintain their market lead with a 5.2% CAGR.</p> \n<h2>Wax heaters: what are these amazing beauty tools?</h2> \n<p>Waxing is an easy procedure. All professionals do is apply some wax on the targeted area and wait for it to dry before peeling it off with all the unwanted hair. However, the wax comes in solid form, so salons and spas must melt it. That\u2019s wherewax heatersenter the picture. These products can melt wax quickly and efficiently while keeping it at the perfect temperature for hair removal.</p> \n<p>Speaking of maintaining temperature, if these machines don\u2019t control their heat, they will affect the wax. If they\u2019re not hot enough, the wax will cool and harden faster than aestheticians can use it\u2014too hot, and the wax will burn clients. Hence, manufacturers design these devices to keep body wax in the best state for efficient hair removal.</p> \n<h2>The types of wax heaters</h2> \n<h3>Hard wax warmers</h3> \n<p>Most salons use wax beads or hard wax for their hair removal procedures. Some consumers think of their warmers as the standard since they are the favorites of the majority.Hard wax warmerscan easily melt beads (or other hard wax forms) and keep them at comfortable temperatures. They also offer various sizes that work depending on the job at hand. For instance, aestheticians won\u2019t need much wax for a standard bikini job.

The boosted awareness of the importance of skin health also significantly impacts the market. North America dominates the skin analyzer market, with the United States registering the highest consumption rate and market share.</p> \n<h2>Why are skin analyzers making waves in the beauty world</h2> \n<p>Choosing the right cosmetic products is never easy, especially for beginners. Since every person has individual requirements, consumers must have more details on what works for them before grabbing any products. That\u2019s where skin analyzers come in.These aesthetic machinesthoroughly examine various aspects of the skin, including texture, pigmentation, and hydration level. Their technology can also detect any irregularities or concerns.</p> \n<p>Skin analyzersoffer consumers more valuable information than what they would get from routine checkups. Here\u2019s a look at other reasons why skin analyzers are catching the attention of many consumers worldwide.</p> \n<p>Sinceskin analyzerscan provide data on consumer\u2019s skincare needs and concerns, they can easily customize their skincare routines. The helpful data will give them insight into what type of products they need to address those issues and the optimal way to use them for better skin health and appearance.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, consumers won\u2019t even know they have some skin concerns, leading to them choosing products that may make things worse. However,skin analyzerscan help detect these early signs. It\u2019s helpful for acne, rosacea, eczema, and even skin cancer, allowing consumers to nip them in the bud before they turn into something serious (like breakouts).</p> \n<p>While detection is this machine\u2019s strong suit, askin analyzercan help consumers track their skincare progress. If they don\u2019t like where it\u2019s going, consumers can make necessary adjustments to routines based on the observed results.</p> \n<p>If consumers don\u2019t want work based on their interpretations, they can consult skincare professionals. These professionals will provide expert advice and recommendations based on the results of skin analyzers.</p> \n<h2>Everything to consider when choosing skin analyzers to sell in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Accuracy and technology</h3> \n<p>Askin analyzer\u2019seffectiveness depends on its ability to give precise and reliable results, highlighting the importance of advanced technological features. Since the device\u2019s technological sophistication influences accuracy, businesses must prioritize cutting-edge features to provide the best analysis experience.</p> \n<p>Look forskin analyzersboasting advanced algorithms and sensing mechanisms. These devices will provide detailed insights into hydration levels, sebum production, elasticity, pigmentation, and wrinkles. Additionally, these advanced technologies reduce error margins in their assessments, providing more reliable data than others without such advancements.</p> \n<h3>Ease of use</h3> \n<p>Accuracy and technology may be the most important aspects, but they won\u2019t make sense if consumers don\u2019t understand what they are doing. That\u2019s why businesses must not compromise on ease of use, as it directly impacts skincare professionals\u2019 efficiency and user experience. Offeringuser-friendly machinessimplifies the operational aspects, making it accessible to everyone\u2014even those without technical expertise.</p> \n<p>One major aspect that determines ease of use is the skin analyzer\u2019s software. Sellers must prioritize models with intuitive interfaces, ensuring skincare professionals can navigate their systems effortlessly. But that\u2019s not all. Well-designed interfaces streamline the inputting data and starting analysis processes, saving practitioners valuable time and reducing the chances of error.</p> \n<p>Report generation should also benefit from this simplicity. User-friendlyskin analyzersmust produce comprehensive reports without sacrificing clarity and readability. It\u2019s particularly important when communicating findings to clients, as easy-to-understand reports would make giving recommendations hassle-free.</p> \n<h3>Data management and integration</h3> \n<p>Progress monitoring is another big aspect of skin analyzers, so they should have the necessary features to make it possible. Data management and integration are the major features for keeping track of consumers\u2019 skincare progress. Skin analyzers that go beyond basic analysis to offer robust data storage capabilities are the better deals for enhanced experiences.</p> \n<p>Data management should allowskin analyzersto store and organize client data. Sellers must stock up on devices that allow the creation of individual client profiles, allowing beauty professionals to track and compare progress over time. In addition to providing helpful insight into skincare regimen effectiveness, this feature will also help tailor future treatments based on historical data.</p> \n<p>Similarly, integration will allow seamless connections between skin analyzers and other software or client records inside the clinic. Devices supporting integration with existing systems (like practice management software or electronic health records) reduce the need for manual data entry while reducing the risk of errors. Additionally, integrating with other software opens up more possibilities. Professionals will easily whip up personalized recommendations that go beyond skin deep.</p> \n<h3>Versatility</h3> \n<p>Versatility matters because skincare isn\u2019t a one-time thing. Skin evolves, seasons change, and so do concerns. Versatile skin analyzers grow with clients, adapting to new challenges and helping to keep their skincare game strong. It\u2019s key to ensuring everyone gets the personalized TLC their skin deserves.</p> \n<p>Adapting to different skin types and conditions is the first sign of amazing versatility. Skin comes in all types (oily, dry, combo), so the best devices should analyze them without issues. Skin concerns also play a huge role here. Whether battling acne, tackling dry patches, or dealing with fine lines, analyzers should be on top of it all. Versatility doesn\u2019t stop at one-size-fits-all\u2014skin analyzers should dish out customized recommendations based on each client\u2019s unique needs.</p> \n<h3>Hygiene and safety</h3> \n<p>Nobody wants to deal with skin issues that aren\u2019t even theirs. The same applies to skin analyzers. Clients with varying issues will use these machines, so spas must ensure no cross-contamination. Businesses can help by offeringmachineswith strong hygiene standards\u2014think disposable caps or sterilization probes.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Skin analyzers are emerging as an amazing way to improve skincare routines. They provide helpful insight into skin type, conditions, and other issues that need fixing. The best part is that these devices also attract enough attention for businesses to profit from their market. According to Google Ads, skin analyzers attracted 6,600 searches in January 2024, showing that many spas are ready to add them to their services!</p> \n"}]}

These devices offer convenience and control, promising a bronzed complexion without extended sun exposure. However, sellers must understand various factors before providing these machines for their buyers.</p> \n<p>This article will dive into five features sellers must prioritize to ensure the safety of their tanning machine offers in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow big is the tanning machine market in 2024?5 features that indicate tanning machines are safe for purchaseFinal words</p> \n<h2>How big is the tanning machine market in 2024?</h2> \n<p>Experts predict thetanning machine marketwill grow at a 5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2028 due to the increasing popularity of indoor tanning. As consumers show more interest in outdoor activities, the cases of sunburns have shot through the roof. As a result, many consumers demand tanning machines to increase their melanin production, driving this market\u2019s growth.</p> \n<p>North America also held the highest market share due to its large population with more disposable incomes and increasing demand for tanning equipment from commercial businesses. Meanwhile, experts predict the tanning machine market for Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa will grow at a speedy 12% CAGR.</p> \n<h2>5 features that indicate tanning machines are safe for purchase</h2> \n<h3>UV output</h3> \n<p>Think of UV output like sun power in atanning machine. It\u2019s what helps consumers get that golden tan. So, when the machine has enough UV output, it\u2019s like giving consumers the perfect amount of sunshine to provide them with the tan they want, just faster and without waiting outside. But there\u2019s a flip side.</p> \n<p>Ifthe machinedoesn\u2019t have enough UV output, it\u2019s like not getting enough sun at the beach\u2014It might take longer to get tan or to look as nice. And nobody wants to spend forever waiting for a tan, right? But since everyone requires something different, what is the best way to solve this UV output? The best solution is adjustable UV settings.</p> \n<p>Adjustable UV settingsoffer some control for the tan. Everyone\u2019s skin is different, so not all tans require the same UV output. Some consumers need less UV power to avoid getting burnt, while others can handle more without problems. Always prioritize stocking up on facial tanning machines with adjustable settings\u2014that way, each person gets the perfect tan for their skin type.</p> \n<h3>Safety features</h3> \n<p>Safety features are another important aspect when choosingfacial tanning machines. They ensure consumers get a comfortable and risk-free tanning experience. Here are some key safety features facial tanning machines must have before purchasing.</p> \n<p>People often make mistakes\u2014as this is how everyone learns. But some mistakes, like letting atanning machinerun for extended periods, can cost more than others. That\u2019s why built-in timers are a necessary feature for facial tanning machines. They help automatically end the session after a predetermined time, preventing overexposure to UV radiation and all its negative effects (like sunburn or skin damage).</p> \n<p>The eyes are not like the skin, which means they need protection when consumers are engaging in their tanning sessions. This means sellers should opt forfacial tanning machineswith built-in goggles or eye shields, protecting consumers\u2019 eyes from harmful UV rays. No one wants eye damage and discomfort because of a tan.</p> \n<p>Some advancedfacial tanning machinesfeature skin sensors that assess the user\u2019s skin type and condition before starting the tanning session. These sensors adjust the UV output levels accordingly to minimize the risk of overexposure and ensure safe tanning for the specific skin type. While not a common feature for most facial tanning machines, it adds a layer of safety to high-end models.</p> \n<p>Look for a facial tanning machine equipped with a cooling system to prevent consumers from overheating and feeling uncomfortable. Light often generates heat, so proper ventilation and cooling will help maintain comfortable temperatures, especially during longer tanning sessions.</p> \n<p>Ensure thefacial tanning machinehas a comprehensive user manual and clear instructions for safe and proper use. Consumers should be able to follow the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for tanning duration, recommended exposure times, and any other safety precautions. It\u2019s a great way to minimize the risk of adverse effects.</p> \n<h3>Size and portability</h3> \n<p>Whatever reason consumers have for indulging infacial tanning machines, one thing\u2019s for sure: size and portability matter.\u00a0 These are the factors that determine how convenient each tanning session would be. No one wants a bulky machine hogging up their precious home\u2019s space. A compact facial tanning machine allows consumers to achieve that perfect tan without sacrificing valuable real estate in their bathroom or bedroom. Whether they live in a cozy apartment or a spacious mansion, having a smaller, more portable device makes it easier to integrate tanning into daily routines!</p> \n<p>And don\u2019t forget about travel. Whether consumers are jet-setting across the globe or embarking on a weekend road trip, offering them portablefacial tanning machinesmeans they can take their glow wherever they go. Gone are the days of relying on sketchy hotel tanning beds or trying to cram oversized equipment into suitcases. With a travel-friendly device, consumers can maintain their bronzed complexion no matter where life takes them.</p> \n<h3>Bulb type</h3> \n<p>Facial tanning machines also come with different bulb types. Each has different tanning requirements, effectiveness, and perks, so businesses should choose the right ones depending on who they want to target. Generally, facial tanning machines can have fluorescent, LED, high-pressure, and low-pressure bulbs.</p> \n<p>These bulbs are the classic options. They emit small levels of UVB rays, making them a great way to stimulate melanin production and give consumers that golden tan. Plus, they\u2019re super affordable and widely available. However, they can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin, so sellers must avoid offering them to consumers prone to sunburns or irritation.</p> \n<p>Next up are the ever-popular LED bulbs. These tanning bulbs are all the rage these days, and for good reason. In addition to emitting UVA rays (which penetrate deeper into the skin for a longer-lasting tan), LED tanning bulbs also offer various colors to suit the user\u2019s mood. Plus, they\u2019re energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than traditional bulbs.</p> \n<p>These bulbs emit primarily UVA rays, with a slight percentage of UVB rays. High-pressure bulbs are great for achieving a deep, even tan quickly. So, facial tanning machines with these bulbs appeal to consumers searching for quick results without sacrificing quality.</p> \n<p>Low-pressure emits a perfect blend of UVA and UVB rays, giving consumers the best of both worlds. Such facial tanning machines are ideal for those with sensitive skin or seeking a gentler tanning experience. While they may take longer to achieve the desired tan, consumers concerned about skin damage or irritation will think they are worth the wait.</p> \n<h3>User-friendly controls</h3> \n<p>User-friendliness is essential for ensuring users get a positive experience, regardless of their expertise. Facial tanning machines with intuitive controls and clear instructions make the tanning process straightforward and accessible, eliminating confusion and frustration. That way, consumers can focus on getting their desired results without technicalities bogging them down. Moreover, user-friendliness promotes safety! Intuitive controls reduce the risk of user error and improper machine use while streamlining the tanning process for a hassle-free experience.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Facialtanning machinesoffer a tempting shortcut to a sun-kissed complexion, but their use comes with important considerations. While they provide convenience and control, their potential risks, including skin damage and premature aging, cannot be ignored. However, offering machines with the right UV output and safety features will help limit these issues. So remember to follow the insights discussed above to offer your buyers the best and safest facial tanners in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

With the beauty industry always evolving, these tools are quickly becoming indispensable for those seeking cutting-edge skin care solutions.</p> \n<h3>Innovations in laser technology for diverse skin tones</h3> \n<p>Traditionally, laser treatments posed risks for darker skin tones, including potential scarring and hyperpigmentation. However, recent technological advancements have significantly reduced these risks, making laser therapy a viable option for a wider range of skin tones.</p> \n<p>Brands like Cynosure are at the forefront of this innovation, developing laser technologies that are tailored specifically for darker complexions. These new devices ensure safer, more effective treatments, facilitating a more inclusive approach to beauty care. As these technologies continue to advance, they promise to open up new possibilities for personalized skin treatment across diverse demographic groups.</p> \n<h3>The rise of at-home laser devices</h3> \n<p>The landscape of personal beauty devices is experiencing a revolution with the introduction of at-home laser technologies.

The ability to extend salon-quality results to the home environment not only enhances the appeal of these devices but also encourages regular usage, leading to better outcomes and greater consumer satisfaction.</p> \n<h3>Expanding light therapy into new beauty categories</h3> \n<p>Light therapy is branching out beyond facial treatments into areas that have historically received less attention in beauty regimens, such as hair, hands, and overall body care. This trend is driven by the growing recognition of the holistic nature of beauty and wellness.</p> \n<p>For instance, the Monpure clinic in London integrates red light therapy with scalp treatments like micro-needling and tattooing to address issues like hair thinning. Such innovative applications signify a broader shift towards the \u2018skinification\u2019 of the entire body, underscoring the versatile potential of light therapy tools to transform not just skincare but comprehensive beauty care.</p> \n<h3>Synergistic strategies for in-clinic and at-home light therapy</h3> \n<p>The boundaries between professional and at-home beauty treatments are increasingly blurring as brands innovate to connect these two worlds through light therapy. One standout example is the UK\u2019s luxury wellness brand LYMA, which has launched a salon version of its popular at-home laser device. This product is designed to complement its range of skincare products, including Oxygen Mist and Glide, which enhance the effectiveness of the laser treatment.</p> \n<p>By creating tools that are versatile for both settings, LYMA is not only enhancing the consumer\u2019s ability to maintain consistent care routines but also democratizing access to advanced beauty treatments. This strategy not only meets the growing demand for professional-grade results at home but also supports the beauty industry\u2019s shift towards more integrated and personalized care solutions.</p> \n<p>The evolution of light therapy from a clinical luxury to an at-home essential marks a significant shift in the beauty and wellness industry.

This article serves as a guide to help sellers find the ideal options to ensure their consumers get the most of this magnificent cleansing tool.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat\u2019s the size of the face cleansing brush market?Why are face-cleansing brushes in vogue?What are the different types of face cleansing brushes?Things to consider when choosing face cleansing brushesBottom line</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s the size of the face cleansing brush market?</h2> \n<p>With many consumers suffering from various skin conditions, It\u2019s no surprise thatfacial cleansing brushesare one of the top products available. Experts say the face-cleansing brush market will reach US$ 33.213 billion by 2033, growing from US$ 9.5 billion in 2022 at an 11.0% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>According to the above research, experts predict the market will register a tremendous boost due to increased skin-related illnesses and rising purchasing power. Additionally, the increasing disposable income will also see consumers spending more on skincare goods and services, helping to boost market growth. Here are other market highlights discussed in the report:</p> \n<h2>Why are face-cleansing brushes in vogue?</h2> \n<p>Skin issues (especially aging and wrinkling) have been rising lately, with many suspecting air pollution as the main culprit. Since such causes are way beyond the average consumer\u2019s control, women have turned to skin health management products as the perfect solution. What does this have to do withfacial cleansing brushes? Many consumers choose these products as the go-to for constant skincare routines.</p> \n<p>Cleansing brushesare great for exfoliating the skin and unclogging pores blocked by debris, brown haze particles, and other impurities. These tools provide a deeper and more effective cleanse than using only hands or clothes. Google Ads data revealed that 201,000 beauty enthusiasts searched for these cleansing brushes in January 2024. They are a must-have for consumers who take their beauty seriously.</p> \n<p>But there are more reasons whyfacial cleansing brusheswill be a top beauty product in 2024. These tools are also multipurpose! They can scrape, shed, saturate, and work on the skin\u2019s surface. They also offer rubbing features to promote skin flexibility and flow\u2014one of the most effective ways to reduce wrinkles. Furthermore, face-cleansing brushes can accommodate various skin types! Most models also run on batteries, which increases their convenience and travel-friendliness.</p> \n<h2>What are the different types of face cleansing brushes?</h2> \n<h3>Electric rotary brushes</h3> \n<p>These are some of the most popularface-cleansing brushes. They use a rotating motion powered by electric motors to clean the skin deeply. Electric rotary brushes often come with soft bristles or silicone tips designed to remove dirt, oil, and makeup from the skin\u2019s surface and pores. Here is the best part: the rotating motion of these brushes helps enhance the mechanical exfoliation of dead skin cells, promoting a smoother and more radiant complexion.</p> \n<h3>Sonic brushes</h3> \n<p>Not everyone likes the rotating techniques. When consumers want a more optimized facial cleansing, they turn tosonic brushes. Unlike traditional rotary brushes, sonic variants rely on rapid vibrations to remove impurities. They also come with brush heads with bristles or silicone nodules. Since these brush heads oscillate at sonic frequencies, they can range from several hundred to thousands of vibrations per minute. Many consumers also use sonic-powered brushes to cleanse their skin without harsh exfoliation.</p> \n<h3>Manual</h3> \n<p>All this high-tech can be tiring for consumers who just want something simple and easy to use\u2014so some may want to return to the trustymanual style, which is why manufacturers also make manual facial cleansing brushes for these consumers. Usually, they feature carefully crafted, sleek designs with high-quality bristles to offer an amazing cleanse. Their ergonomic handles make manual brushes great for gently removing makeup or other residue.</p> \n<h2>Things to consider when choosing face cleansing brushes</h2> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>Consumers always prioritize their size needs when choosing their perfectfacial cleansing brush. It\u2019s necessary because the right size gives them more control over their face cleansing session. Most beauty experts recommend choosing something slightly smaller than the target consumer\u2019s hand size. That\u2019s the best way for them to get into all the hard-to-reach or congested areas while handling larger portions like the cheeks and forehead.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a table showcasing the different brush sizes and who they\u2019re perfect for:</p> \n<h3>Skin type</h3> \n<p>Some brushescan work for all skin types, while others come with designs for specific ones. Here\u2019s the lowdown on what consumers look for based on their skin type:</p> \n<h3>Vibration or rotating technology</h3> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, most facial brushes use rotation or sonic (vibration) technology. But which would consumers choose? The answer is it depends on their cleansing technique and budget.</p> \n<p>Rotaryfacial cleansing brushesrotate at high speeds to loosen and remove impurities. While they are great at exfoliation, they don\u2019t offer any extra advantages. However, rotary brushes are the most affordable after manual variants.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, sonic facial cleansing brushes use vibrations to cleanse and offer other skincare benefits. These vibrations help break down dirt, oil, and makeup while helping to improve blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. But here\u2019s the catch: sonic facial cleaners may be more effective but are also the most expensive.</p> \n<h3>Adjustable settings and battery life</h3> \n<p>Another thing most consumers love is brushes with adjustable intensity settings. Customizing the speed and power of theircleaning brushallows consumers to tailor their beauty routine to their skin\u2019s needs and prevent overstimulation.</p> \n<p>Battery life is another important part to consider. Offering consumers longer battery lives ensures they get consistent performance without needing frequent recharging. More importantly, rechargeable face-cleaning brushes are the better options because they provide more convenience and are cost-effective in the long run.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Skin issues may arise, but face-cleansing brushes are a consumers\u2019 secret weapons to combat them. These awesome beauty tools can handle everything from exfoliation to lymphatic drainage\u2014though it depends on the type consumers get. Even better, face-cleansing brushes are performing excellently, growing to 49,500 searches in January 2024 from 33,100 in 2023. There\u2019s a rising demand for these tools, so businesses should act fast to avoid missing out on sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

They expect the market to grow at a 9.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032. Based on the report, a few factors, like the prominence of tattoos as an artistic expression trend, technological innovations, rise in cultural acceptions, and multiple customization/personalization options, are propelling market demand.</p> \n<p>And with a higher demand for tattoos comes the need for more tattoo stencils. Hence, according to the report, North America is the current market leader due to the high prevalence of tattoo culture and acceptance. Asia Pacific is experiencing a surge in tattoo acceptance, driven by urbanization and cultural influences.</p> \n<h2>Everything to factor in when selecting tattoo stencils in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Design complexity</h3> \n<p>Most consumers see their dream tattoo as creating a masterpiece, so picking theright stencilis their first brushstroke. They think about the complexity of their desired design before buying from business buyers. If target consumers want a detailed fire-breathing dragon or an intricate mandala, retailers must offer stencils with similar detail complexity.

Led by Baby Boomers and Generation X, this movement encourages a view of aging as a natural and respectable part of life, rather than a condition to be fought against. The concept that beauty should not diminish with age is gaining traction, fueled by a societal push toward diversity and inclusivity in beauty standards.</p> \n<p>This evolving narrative champions age diversity and encourages the development of products and services that enhance well-being across all life stages. Beauty brands are now challenged to redefine their messaging, shifting from age prevention to age celebration. This includes promoting products that cater to a variety of skin types and concerns associated with different life phases without segregating consumers into age-based categories.</p> \n<p>The industry\u2019s response has been to focus on innovation in product formulations that offer benefits like hydration, firmness, and a healthy glow, which are valued by consumers of all ages. This shift not only reflects changing consumer attitudes but also helps to destigmatize aging within the broader cultural context.</p> \n<h2>Consumer anxiety about aging and its impact</h2> \n<p>A significant percentage of consumers, particularly women, experience anxiety about aging, influenced by societal pressures and media portrayals of youth as the ideal. A survey by WGSN highlights that 74% of Gen X women are concerned about their aging, with such worries beginning as early as 29. This widespread concern has substantial implications for consumer behavior, with many seeking products that promise to mitigate visible signs of aging.</p> \n<p>The beauty industry has historically capitalized on these anxieties by marketing anti-aging products. However, the age-agnostic movement is reshaping this approach by promoting products that emphasize overall well-being rather than age reversal. Brands that align with this philosophy foster a more positive relationship with consumers, emphasizing authenticity and holistic care.</p> \n<p>This trend towards age inclusivity is not only more ethical but also resonates with a growing demographic that values transparency and products that support aging gracefully instead of denying it. As a result, there\u2019s a noticeable shift in consumer loyalty towards brands that respect their aging concerns and address them with integrity rather than exploiting them.</p> \n<h2>How brands are responding to the age-agnostic demand</h2> \n<p>Responding to the age-agnostic trend, beauty brands are revamping their product lines and marketing strategies to appeal to consumers across the age spectrum. This shift involves moving away from traditional age-specific products towards offerings that focus on overall skin health and well-being. Brands are now emphasizing products that offer benefits like enhanced hydration, improved elasticity, and increased radiance, which are important to consumers of all ages.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, marketing language is evolving to be more inclusive, celebrating all stages of life rather than prioritizing youth. For instance, brands are highlighting the effectiveness of their products for enhancing natural beauty and are actively using models of various ages in their campaigns to reflect this inclusive approach. This strategic pivot not only responds to the changing consumer demand but also taps into a broader market by addressing the needs of an often-overlooked demographic. By focusing on universal skin concerns and avoiding age-specific targeting, brands can create a more inclusive environment that empowers consumers to feel confident and valued at any age.</p> \n<p>The age-agnostic beauty trend is reshaping the beauty industry, fostering a more inclusive and empowering approach that resonates with consumers across generations. As societal norms evolve, brands that embrace this shift, moving away from the traditional anti-aging rhetoric to celebrate beauty at every stage of life, are positioning themselves for success. By focusing on universal benefits such as hydration, resilience, and radiance, and by adopting marketing strategies that honor authenticity and holistic well-being, these brands are not only meeting the current consumer demand but are also setting a new standard in the beauty industry. This movement towards age inclusivity reflects a broader cultural shift towards valuing diversity and individuality, ensuring that beauty is accessible and relevant to all, irrespective of age. As this trend continues to grow, it promises to expand market opportunities and enhance consumer satisfaction, leading the way to a more age-empathetic future in beauty.</p> \n"}]}

This approach views packaging not just as a container, but as an iconic representation that embodies deeper meanings and values.</p> \n<p>Brands adopting this trend utilize shapes, textures, and materials that reflect their heritage and ethos, turning the packaging into a crucial part of the consumer experience. By embracing designs that are both abstract and reminiscent of natural forms, these packages become meaningful icons that elevate the product\u2019s perceived value and emotional appeal.</p> \n<h2>Strategic importance of tactile design</h2> \n<p>In an era where digital interactions dominate, tactile packaging offers a sensory counterbalance that can significantly enhance consumer engagement. The strategic incorporation of tactile elements in packaging design not only captivates the sense of touch but also reinforces brand identity through unique sensory experiences.</p> \n<p>Research indicates that tactile packaging can increase purchase intent, making it a compelling strategy for brands aiming to stand out in a crowded market. Brands like TWYG and C\u00e9cred leverage this by integrating textures and materials that invite touch, thereby fostering a stronger emotional connection with their products.</p> \n<h2>Key brands and market leaders</h2> \n<p>Leading the charge in totemic packaging are brands like Kindred Black, TWYG, C\u00e9cred, and Soulvent, each introducing distinctive elements that reflect their unique brand stories and consumer ethos. Kindred Black\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day fragrance, for instance, features a bottle in an abstract glass form that doubles as decor, exemplifying how packaging can extend beyond functionality to form part of a lifestyle aesthetic. Similarly, TWYG draws inspiration from the heartwood of the totara tree, reflecting its sustainability commitments and heritage in the tactile and visual design of its skincare products.</p> \n<h2>Future directions and sustainability considerations</h2> \n<p>As the beauty industry evolves, totemic packaging is poised to play a significant role in shaping future trends, particularly around sustainability and consumer interaction. This trend aligns well with the growing consumer demand for products that not only look good but also offer environmental benefits. Brands are increasingly tasked with designing packaging that serves multiple functions: being aesthetically pleasing, culturally relevant, and environmentally responsible.</p> \n<p>The sustainability aspect of totemic packaging is particularly critical. Brands like TWYG are leading the way by integrating minimally packaged refills and using sustainable materials that reduce environmental impact without compromising design integrity. The concept of keepsake packaging, designed to be kept and reused rather than discarded, is gaining traction. This approach not only reduces waste but also enhances the consumer\u2019s brand experience, adding value through longevity and functionality.</p> \n<p>Moreover, as brands continue to innovate, the integration of advanced materials and smart technologies into totemic packaging could further revolutionize the consumer experience. These technologies might include biodegradable composites, digitally enhanced labels, or packaging that changes in response to environmental factors, offering new ways for brands to interact with consumers and reinforce their commitment to sustainability.</p> \n<p>By combining aesthetic appeal with practical sustainability, totemic packaging not only meets current market demands but also sets the stage for future innovations in the beauty industry. As this trend continues to develop, it will likely influence broader packaging strategies across multiple sectors, urging brands to rethink how they communicate their core values through design.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>As we look towards 2025/26, totemic packaging is set to redefine the landscape of beauty packaging with its unique blend of cultural reverence, tactile engagement, and sustainable design. This trend not only enhances the consumer\u2019s unboxing experience but also strengthens brand loyalty and market differentiation in a competitive industry. For brands looking to forge deeper connections with their audience, totemic packaging offers a compelling avenue that marries aesthetic innovation with environmental consciousness. As this trend continues to evolve, it promises to bring new levels of creativity and sustainability to the forefront of the beauty industry, making each product a testament to the brand\u2019s commitment to beauty, heritage, and responsibility.</p> \n"}]}

These methods focus on restoring and enhancing the natural cycle of the ecosystems from which ingredients are sourced. Regenerative farming practices, such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage, help maintain soil health, increase water retention, and sequester carbon.</p> \n<p>Circular systems in beauty might involve using waste materials as resources, promoting zero-waste packaging, and encouraging the recycling and composting of products. These practices ensure that beauty brands operate sustainably and contribute positively to environmental conservation, creating products that consumers can feel good about.</p> \n<h2>The rise of soil-based beauty ingredients</h2> \n<p>Exploring the untapped potential of soil and its inhabitants, beauty brands are discovering new, sustainable ingredients. Microbes and worms, for example, play essential roles in enriching the soil and are now being recognized for their benefits in skincare formulations.</p> \n<p>These organisms help break down organic matter, releasing nutrients that are highly beneficial for the skin. Similarly, insects are being studied for their rich chemical compositions, which can offer anti-inflammatory and healing properties. This shift towards soil-based ingredients not only opens up new avenues for product innovation but also aligns with the increasing consumer demand for natural and eco-friendly beauty solutions.</p> \n<h2>Compostable packaging innovations in skincare</h2> \n<p>As sustainability becomes a more pressing concern, the beauty industry is innovating with new types of packaging to reduce environmental impact. Compostable packaging materials that break down and offer nutrients to the soil are gaining popularity.</p> \n<p>These materials often contain active ingredients like nitrogen and potassium, which enhance the soil\u2019s fertility when they decompose. This approach not only helps in reducing the waste associated with beauty products but also contributes to a circular economy model where product life cycles are designed to have a positive environmental impact. Brands that adopt these practices are not only leading the way in sustainability but are also meeting the growing consumer demand for responsible and eco-conscious products.</p> \n<p>As the beauty industry progresses, the embrace of \u201cBackyard Beauty\u201d reflects a transformative shift towards sustainable practices that honor and utilize the earth\u2019s natural resources. The recognition of soil as a critical element, the implementation of circular systems and regenerative farming, the innovative use of soil-derived ingredients, and the development of compostable packaging options are all testaments to a growing commitment to environmental stewardship. By focusing on sustainability, the beauty sector not only enhances its ecological footprint but also aligns with the evolving values of consumers who prioritize both the efficacy and ethical implications of their beauty choices. This trend towards soil-centric sustainability in beauty is not just a fleeting style but a fundamental movement poised to reshape the industry\u2019s future, making beauty a powerful force for positive environmental impact.</p> \n"}]}

They also anticipate the market will register a 5.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032.</p> \n<p>The tattoo ink market owes its growth to the advancements in ink technology, evolving tattoo culture/trends, and expansion of the tattoo industry. Here are the key takeaways from the tattoo ink market:</p> \n<h2>What to consider when buying tattoo inks to sell in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Ink type</h3> \n<p>Tattoo inksare not a universal buy. They come in a range of types that business buyers should consider carefully before purchasing to sell. Thankfully, the list is not long. In fact, retailers only have to choose between three types: acrylic, vegetable inks, and otras tintas. Here\u2019s a closer look at each of them:</p> \n<p>Acrylictattoo inksuse pigments from metals like beryllium, arsenic, nickel, cobalt, and selenium. They\u2019re the first choice for many tattoo artists due to their intense color payoff, meaning consumers will get vibrant and striking designs with this look. But that\u2019s not all.Acrylic inkshave incredible wear durability, allowing consumers to maintain their tattoo quality for years (with proper maintenance, of course!).</p> \n<p>However, there are three things worth noting about acrylic inks. First, acrylic inks may create nasty side effects on sensitive skin, with allergies being the most common reactions. Second, these inks can make taking medical tests (like MRA) difficult, especially in the tattooed area. Lastly, acrylic is tricky to remove with a laser. Despite these drawbacks, many consumers prefer acrylic inks to other tattoo types.</p> \n<p>These inkstake an organic route to counter most of the downsides of their acrylic cousins. They have lower chances of causing terrible skin reactions and are nearly 100% exempt from causing allergies due to their hypoallergenic nature. Another benefit in favor of vegetable inks is that they assimilate better and absorb more easily into the body than acrylic inks. They\u2019re also vegan, making them the go-to for consumers who care about animal cruelty.</p> \n<p>However,vegetable inksare not without their pitfalls. Some rumors say vegetable inks are not as durable as their acrylic counterparts. So, designs may fade faster and more easily. Some people also say vegetable ink colors look very impressive, meaning tattoo artists must handle these inks more carefully during application.</p> \n<p>These arethe inkspopular for creating fluorescent and ultraviolet tattoos. While fluorescent tattoos glow in the dark without other light sources, ultraviolet ones can only become visible under UV black light. Because of these special effects, these inks often contain metallic pigments. Sometimes, they add vegetable or plastic elements to their formulas.</p> \n<h3>List of materials</h3> \n<p>Tattoo inkscan come with other ingredients to make a complete formula. So, business buyers must examine what manufacturers put in their tattoo inks to determine if they\u2019re safe. Nonetheless, keep in mind that some suppliers won\u2019t fulfill this request because they want to protect the secrets of their formula. But there\u2019s an easy way around this slight roadblock. Retailers can request an ingredient list and MSDS (Material Security Data Sheet) instead.</p> \n<p>After getting the needed information, scan through it to find any oddities. The Ideal tattoo ink can contain active ingredients like pigments and solvents. It can also have binders and preservatives to sanitize, reduce the odor, and maintain liquid consistency. However, it shouldn\u2019t contain denatured alcohol, lead, glycol, and other cancer-causing compounds. Businesses must avoid such inks to keep their consumers safe.</p> \n<h3>Color options</h3> \n<p>Tattoo inks also offer different colors. However, unlike other color palettes, tattoo ink colors react differently to the human body. Nevertheless, artists choose their preferred colors based on their style.</p> \n<p>For example, artists specializing in monochrome designs will always go for black inks, white highlighting pigments, and gray wash sets. Conversely, color artists will want to explore more options to build a great palette.</p> \n<p>The table below shows the different tattoo ink colors and their various effects:</p> \n<h2>Three tips for selling tattoo inks profitably and safely</h2> \n<p>After setting up the tattoo ink inventory, there are a few bits business buyers must iron out before starting the business. Selling tattoo inks involves navigating legal and market considerations retailers must follow. The tips are as follows:</p> \n<p>Tip 1:</p> \n<p>Before selling tattoo inks, businesses must research the laws and rules in their business area. Such laws often dictate how retailers should go about selling these products. Different places may have different rules, so retailers must know the specific legal requirements for selling tattoo-related items, including labels, manufacturing standards, and safety measures.</p> \n<p>Tip 2:</p> \n<p>Additionally, business buyers must ensure the tattoo inks they\u2019re buying from manufacturers follow safety and health rules for cosmetic or tattoo products. These rules help protect consumers from potential harm or health issues, so avoiding breaking them is a surefire way to increase sales.</p> \n<p>Tip 3:</p> \n<p>Lastly, business buyers must check if regulatory authorities require product testing or certification. They can order samples first to see if the products pass safety assessments and meet quality standards before ordering in bulk.</p> \n<h2>The bottom line</h2> \n<p>Inks are the most important part of the tattooing process. Since they\u2019ll go into the skin, consumers are often conscious about the type of tattoo ink artists have in their arsenal. So, businesses must always pick the righttattoo inksto attract more consumers.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, selling them is a different ball game. Various governments have passed laws and regulations to help prevent the spread of fake, harmful products and ensure safety. So, retailers must take the time to ensure their products meet the safety guidelines and other legal requirements. After that, they can leverage the three tips discussed above to help boost tattoo ink sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

As traditional sources become less sustainable, the focus has shifted towards developing perfumes that are both long-lasting and environmentally friendly. By employing innovative technologies, brands are now capable of synthesizing complex scents that mimic those of rare and endangered plants. This not only helps in conserving biological diversity but also ensures that beloved fragrances remain in production without the ecological guilt associated with traditional sourcing methods.</p> \n<p>Biotechnology is proving crucial in addressing the pressing issue of sustainability in perfumery. It allows for the recreation of precise scent molecules, which are often difficult and costly to extract from their natural sources. Furthermore, these technologies enable the creation of stable scents that do not degrade as quickly over time, enhancing the overall consumer experience. Brands embracing these technologies are setting new standards for quality and responsibility in the industry, leading a shift towards more sustainable practices that others are beginning to follow.</p> \n<h2>Pioneering brands in immortal perfumery</h2> \n<p>Several innovative brands are leading the charge in the realm of immortal perfumery, utilizing cutting-edge technology to redefine the sustainability of scents. Swiss perfume giant Firmenich, for example, has developed its Firgood collection, which includes a synthetic version of the traditionally coveted lily-of-the-valley scent. This fragrance is crafted using low-impact microwave technology, which not only minimizes environmental damage but also ensures that the scent\u2019s production is more sustainable and less reliant on natural extraction methods.</p> \n<p>Similarly, L\u2019Or\u00e9al has partnered with Cosmo International Fragrances to embrace sustainable air extraction technology. This collaboration has led to the development of sustainable tuberose notes, demonstrating a commitment to eco-friendly practices while maintaining the luxurious essence of traditional perfumery. These initiatives highlight how the industry can maintain its lavish standards and allure without compromising on environmental values.</p> \n<p>Moreover, these pioneering efforts are not just about sustainability; they also introduce a dimension of innovation that could potentially expand the perfume market. By creating scents that are both unique and environmentally conscious, these brands are catering to a growing segment of consumers who seek luxury products that align with their values of responsibility and sustainability.</p> \n<h2>The future of fragrance with AI technology</h2> \n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize the perfume industry by enhancing the speed and sustainability of fragrance development. US-based startup Osmo exemplifies this trend by employing AI to analyze the molecular structure of scents. This innovative approach allows Osmo to predict how a molecule will smell, thereby significantly speeding up the process of new product development (NPD). More importantly, AI facilitates the identification of sustainable alternatives, ensuring that new fragrances are not only captivating but also environmentally conscious.</p> \n<p>AI\u2019s role in perfumery extends beyond mere scent prediction. It enables companies to experiment with complex fragrance combinations that would be too resource-intensive to explore through traditional methods. This capability fosters a creative explosion in scent design, leading to unique and memorable fragrances that were previously unimaginable. Moreover, AI can optimize production processes, reduce waste, and minimize the carbon footprint associated with traditional perfume manufacturing.</p> \n<p>The integration of AI in fragrance development is a testament to how technology can foster innovation while adhering to sustainable practices. As this technology continues to evolve, the potential for creating \u201cnever-before-experienced\u201d scents becomes more palpable, promising a future where fragrances not only evoke emotions but also respect and preserve the natural world.</p> \n<p>The fusion of biotechnology and artificial intelligence in perfumery is not just a trend but a transformative shift towards sustainability and innovation. As the industry moves away from traditional, often unsustainable methods of scent creation, these technologies offer a path to preserving biodiversity while delivering unique and enduring fragrances. Brands like Firmenich, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, and startups like Osmo are at the forefront of this revolution, proving that it is possible to captivate the senses without compromising the planet. The future of fragrance, powered by immortal perfumery, holds the promise of an industry that values both heritage and innovation, ensuring that the luxury of fine perfumes is accessible for generations to come.</p> \n"}]}

A simple, soft shine is like an instant makeover. For this reason, lip glosses are the ultimate product for ladies looking for effortless beauty. Even better, many ladies use lip gloss to complement a perfect everyday makeup routine.</p> \n<p>These beauty products will always be in demand. However, the variety of lip gloss in the market is so huge that simply stocking up on any type may not take a business buyer far.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, this article will highlight what to consider when entering the lip gloss market in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the lip gloss marketThings to remember when choosing lip gloss in 2024Bottom line</p> \n<h2>An overview of the lip gloss market</h2> \n<p>Thelip glossmarket reached US$ 3.67 billion in 2023, up from US$ 3.5 billion the previous year. However, experts predict the market will increase to US$ 5.8 billion by 2032 at a 4.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Based on the above report, the lip gloss market is experiencing huge growth because of the growing awareness and importance of personal grooming, the increasing purchasing power of women, and a rising trend towards organic cosmetics. Social media and celebrity endorsements also significantly contribute to the market\u2019s growth.</p> \n<p>The report also revealed that matte lip glosses are the biggest type segment, registering an impressive 35% (US$ 1.28 billion) of the global revenue. Furthermore, standard lip glosses generated a higher income than organic/natural options, accounting for 70.4%. But, experts say organic lip gloss will grow at the fastest CAGR.\u00a0 Lastly, according to the same report, North America dominates the lip gloss market, with the U.S. industry making the largest contribution.</p> \n<h2>Things to remember when choosing lip gloss in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Glossy vs. matte</h3> \n<p>Do consumers prefer a glossy or matte finish for lip gloss? This question is the first step in determining the high-qualitylip glossideal for target customers. And sometimes, women want both! But which one looks best on them? Well, it depends on their skin type and preferences.</p> \n<p>Glossy lip glosseslook amazing and are attention-grabbing. They moisturize and give the lips a lustrous sheen, leaving them shiny and oily for hours. In contrast,matte lip glossesoffer zero sheen. Instead, they offer a more solid finish that\u2019s not less attractive. And, since they\u2019re not moisturizing, matte lip glosses won\u2019t feather or flake.</p> \n<p>While glossy lip glosses have an uncomfortable, oily feeling, they\u2019re a great solution for consumers with dry, chapped lips. Plus, they\u2019re easier to apply and match almost all skin tones. Matte, on the other hand, appeals more to women with wetter lips. However, they\u2019re not as easy to apply as glossy variants because they offer less coverage.</p> \n<h3>Preferred formula</h3> \n<p>Choosing between matte and glossylip glossesis one thing, but it depends on the target consumer\u2019s preference. Here\u2019s a brief look at the different lip gloss formulas:</p> \n<h3>Lip gloss type</h3> \n<p>The next thing to consider is what type may appeal to consumers better.Lip glossesmay have a simple job, but they offer various finishes and effects. So, consumers choose them based on the look they want to achieve.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the different types of lip glosses and the finish they\u2019ll offer:</p> \n<h3>Consumer\u2019s skin</h3> \n<p>When deciding on lip glosses, businesses must consider the target consumers\u2019 skin tones and undertones. Luckily, it is easy to determine whatlip glosseswork for both skin categories.</p> \n<p>For the undertone, first decide if the consumers have warm (yellow), cool (pink), or neutral undertones. Yellow undertones always go for warmer lip gloss shades or clear ones, while pink undertones look amazing with blue or purple hues.</p> \n<p>For skin tone, there are a lot more colors to consider. Here\u2019s a table breaking them down:</p> \n<h3>Sun protection</h3> \n<p>The lips are not immune to sun damage. Thus, business buyers should offerlip glosseswith SPF to keep consumers healthy and happy.</p> \n<p>The safest bet is opting for lip glosses with at least 15 SPF. However, sun protection is not the only benefit of SPF lip glosses. They also help keep the look bright and beautiful all day.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>Almost all cosmetic products contain oil, glycol, sulfates, alcohol, parabens, and synthetic dyes\u2014including lip glosses. While some of these ingredients are not the most dangerous in the world, they adversely affect human health and the environment.</p> \n<p>Some cosmetic products use eco-friendly ingredients, including thelip glossesbusiness buyers should aim for. Ladies worried about using chemicals on their lips (especially those with sensitive skin) may want lip glosses without oil or alcohol.</p> \n<p>Such lip glosses contain carrier oils or vitamin E, making them safe for the body, skin, and environment. Also, consumers with sensitive skin will want softer formulas with fewer scents to reduce the chances of irritation (redness, bumps, or rashes)</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Offering the right lip gloss can instantly change a consumer\u2019s look and keep them returning for more. But while the right shade makes everyone happy, the wrong shade may draw attention to thelips, and not necessarily the right type of attention. Also, since we\u2019re talking about cosmetics, ladies may want to experiment, so have enough variety to satisfy a range of preferences\u2014as this is a sure way to get more lip gloss sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

As of 2026, primers and tone-up creams are tailored to achieve specific skin finishes, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality. One significant aspect is the growth of personalized skin care products, which is expected to expand substantially. The market for these products is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.0% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is partly due to advancements in technology that allow for more personalized beauty solutions, including the use of AI to customize products to individual skin types and concerns\u200b (Grand View Research)\u200b. In addition, consumer behavior shows a strong inclination towards personalized beauty products. A recent study highlights that 72% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for personalized cosmetic products, underscoring the significant demand for customization in the beauty sector\u200b (GreyB)\u200b.</p> \n<p>This trend towards personalization is reflected in the rising popularity of products like the ONE/SIZE Tacky Hydrating Primer in the US, which is formulated with ingredients like beta glucan, hyaluronic acid, omega fatty acids, and black tea to offer both a lasting hold and a glowy finish. Such products highlight the industry\u2019s shift from one-size-fits-all solutions to more tailored, functional cosmetics that meet individual consumer needs\u200b (Cosmetics Business)\u200b. Meanwhile, Italian supplier Regi Laboratories introduces an innovation with their foam-textured primers. These come in three varieties: illuminating, mattifying, and moisturizing, catering to diverse consumer needs and preferences.</p> \n<h2>Functional bases: skincare meets makeup</h2> \n<p>The intersection of skincare and makeup is indeed seeing notable growth, particularly in products like water-based primers, concealers, and foundations, which offer both aesthetic and skin health benefits. This shift is reflected in the increasing global Google search volumes for these products. For instance, there has been a significant uptick in searches for water-based foundations, which are praised for their hydrating properties and lighter, more skin-like finishes\u200b (CB Insights)\u200b\u200b (Editorialist)\u200b.</p> \n<p>This trend is supported by significant increases in global Google searches for water-based products like concealer, primer, and foundation, which have seen upticks of 400%, 300%, and 250% year-over-year, respectively. Products such as the Chinese brand Juyou\u2019s Tripple Protein Repair Essence Cushion Cream exemplify this shift. This cream not only soothes damaged skin barriers but also provides a natural finish with 40% pomegranate fruit water and 75% essence, including innovative ingredients like human recombinant collagen that offer reparative benefits.</p> \n<h2>Strategic actions: optimizing makeup base applications</h2> \n<p>Adapting makeup-based applications to meet the evolving demands of consumers requires integrating color-correcting properties with protective ingredients or specialized skin finishes. A prime example of this trend in action is the Japanese brand Maquillage, which offers a mint-colored tone-up cream. For instance, their mint-colored tone-up cream not only corrects redness but also enhances skin appearance by providing UV protection and minimizing pores. This product exemplifies the trend towards multifunctional beauty products that cater to both aesthetic and skin care needs\u200b (Beauty Box Korea)\u200b.</p> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly looking for products that offer more than just basic coverage or color correction. They value products that also provide skin care benefits like UV protection and pore minimizing, which aligns with a broader industry trend towards multifunctional and protective makeup bases. This strategic innovation in makeup products like the Maquillage tone-up cream reflects an understanding of consumer desires for products that not only improve appearance immediately but also contribute to long-term skin health\u200b (Beauty Box Korea)\u200b. These strategic innovations underscore the importance of fusing aesthetic benefits with functional skin care attributes to meet the sophisticated needs of today\u2019s beauty consumers.</p> \n<h2>Market entry strategies: expanding demographics and innovations</h2> \n<p>The beauty industry is witnessing new entry points into makeup bases, particularly among men and the skincare-obsessed Gen Alpha. Innovations are not just about product ingredients but also about application ease and inclusive marketing. For instance, the Korean men\u2019s brand DASHU has tailored its Multi Cover Stick Foundation to simplify the makeup routine for beginners, including an inner layer of primer powder and an outer layer of foundation infused with SPF50+ PA++++.</p> \n<p>This product design reflects a deeper understanding of male consumers\u2019 preferences for straightforward, multifunctional products, highlighting a growing segment in the beauty market that demands attention and innovation.</p> \n<h2>Trend Investment Projection: sustainability and innovation in makeup prep</h2> \n<p>In 2024, one of the dominant trends in cosmetic packaging is the shift towards sustainability. Consumers are increasingly conscious of their environmental impact and expect brands to be responsible. This has pushed cosmetic companies to adopt eco-friendly packaging solutions such as biodegradable materials, refillable containers, and reduced plastic packaging\u200b (Cosmetic Packaging Now)\u200b.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the overall beauty industry is seeing a significant trend towards sustainable and clean products. The demand for products that are both environmentally friendly and free from harmful chemicals continues to grow. Nearly all consumers (95%) are taking action to live sustainably, and they expect brands to reflect these values in their products. This trend is not only prevalent in product formulations but also in packaging, where there is a strong push for materials that have minimal environmental impact\u200b (NIQ)\u200b.</p> \n<p>Moreover, technology is playing a crucial role in enhancing consumer experiences and offering personalized beauty solutions. For instance, about 49% of beauty brands are using AI to analyze customer data and create more intelligent shopping suggestions, and 44% are using technology to create more targeted marketing campaigns based on consumer data\u200b (Global Cosmetic Industry)\u200b.</p> \n<p>As we look to the future, the makeup prep market is poised for transformative growth, driven by innovation and changing consumer expectations. The shift towards personalized makeup bases that cater to diverse skin types and preferences underscores a broader trend in the beauty industry towards inclusivity and specificity. Brands like ONE/SIZE and Juyou are leading the way with products that not only enhance aesthetic appeal but also incorporate significant skincare benefits, marrying functionality with beauty. Meanwhile, the expansion of makeup base users to include men and younger generations signals a growing market segment hungry for tailored, easy-to-use products. As environmental concerns and the pursuit of sustainability continue to influence consumer choices, the makeup industry must adapt by integrating eco-friendly practices and ingredients into their product development. By staying attuned to these shifts and continuously innovating, brands can ensure they meet the evolving needs of their customers while strengthening their market position in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p> \n"}]}

Additionally, U.S.-based Fluus introduces biodegradable menstrual pads and wrappers that are flushable and free from micro-plastics, ensuring they break down effectively in water. This shift towards soluble products highlights a significant move towards sustainability, providing consumers with environmentally friendly options that do not compromise on quality or effectiveness.</p> \n<p>Conserving Beauty, an Australian beauty brand, is making significant strides in reducing environmental impacts within the industry by focusing on water conservation. The brand has developed products like dissolvable sheet masks and waterless cosmetics, aiming to minimize water usage throughout their lifecycle. This approach aligns with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to responsible consumption and clean water and sanitation\u200b (Conserving Beauty)\u200b.</p> \n<p>The company\u2019s founder, Natassia Nicolao, has been proactive in rethinking how beauty products are made, emphasizing the need to shift away from traditional water-based formulations. This move is part of a broader strategy to manage the water footprint more sustainably, including sourcing ingredients responsibly and minimizing water use in production and supply chains\u200b (awa.asn)\u200b.</p> \n<p>Moreover, U.S.-based Fluus is contributing to the eco-friendly beauty movement with its flushable and biodegradable menstrual pads and wrappers, designed to degrade effectively in water and be free from microplastics. This innovation is crucial as it addresses the environmental issues associated with non-biodegradable menstrual products that contribute to marine pollution\u200b (awa.asn)\u200b.</p> \n<h2>Leading the charge in no-packaging beauty products</h2> \n<p>Innovation continues with the introduction of no-packaging beauty solutions aimed at eliminating traditional waste. Brazilian brand Amokarit\u00e9 has developed solid pigmented balls made from natural rocks and vegetable oils, effectively bypassing the need for plastic packaging.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Lush has innovated with its Naked Mascara, a solid composition of butter and wax paired with a reusable and recyclable brush. These initiatives are pivotal in reducing the reliance on unrecyclable plastic within the beauty industry, setting a new standard for eco-conscious beauty products.</p> \n<h2>Challenges and solutions in soluble and no-packaging product development</h2> \n<p>Transitioning to soluble and no-packaging formats presents several challenges, including feasibility and protection of the products during transit. Not all products or formulations are suited for such innovations. However, solutions are emerging. Korean brand Siita has developed a biodegradable plastic resin used in its hand cream packaging, which degrades into eco-friendly fertilizer within three months of disposal. This advancement demonstrates the potential for developing protective, sustainable materials that could revolutionize beauty product packaging.</p> \n<h2>Key players in the soluble beauty movement</h2> \n<p>The drive towards more sustainable beauty practices is supported by innovative brands dedicated to reducing environmental impact. These pioneers are not only developing new products but also influencing industry standards towards sustainability. Their commitment to environmentally friendly practices is shaping the future of the beauty industry, encouraging a shift towards more responsible production and consumption patterns.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The shift towards soluble and no-packaging beauty products is not just a trend but a necessary evolution in the cosmetics industry. As consumer awareness and demand for environmentally friendly products increase, brands like Conserving Beauty, Fluus, Amokarit\u00e9, Lush, and Siita are leading the way in sustainable innovation. These pioneers are proving that beauty can be both effective and eco-conscious, offering solutions that benefit both the planet and the consumer. By embracing these innovations, the beauty industry can significantly reduce its environmental footprint, paving the way for a more sustainable and guilt-free future in cosmetics.</p> \n"}]}

Because of their impressive ability to reflect light. Consumers love thedazzling effecton their lips. And it does more than impart a radiant shine! The metallic effect also gives the illusion of fuller and plumper lips.</p> \n<p>Usually, manufacturers packthese lipstickswith high pigments to give them their metallic finish.

They also offer light to medium opacity, allowing consumers to subtly showcase their natural lip color.</p> \n<p>However,glossy lipstickshave the lowest staying power. But, the trade-off here is the continuous hydration they provide. Glossy lipsticks also create plump and luscious appearances, using a radiant sheen to enhance natural lip contours.</p> \n<p>But wait, there\u2019s more. Glossy lipsticks are also versatile. Ladies can layer them over other lipstick types for the perfect customized look. For instance, they can add a shiny layer on matte lipsticks, transforming the look by adding dimension and a touch of shine.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Whether women want soft, subtle looks or something more dramatic, lipsticks are the simplest and quickest way to get the desired aesthetic. They\u2019re key to tying the overall makeup look together, preventing women from looking bland or incomplete.</p> \n<p>But with so many lipstick choices available today (thanks to modern technology), it may be overwhelming for businesses to enter the market. But there\u2019s no need for concern! Leverage the six lipstick types discussed in this article and watch sales grow in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

These innovations highlight how accommodating individual differences in comfort and physical changes not only enhances the user experience but also cements a brand\u2019s reputation for thoughtful, consumer-centric design.</p> \n<p>Empathetic beauty technology represents a significant shift towards more personalized, intuitive, and responsive consumer products in the beauty industry.

This concept has surfaced as a pivotal trend in the beauty and lifestyle industries, where the appeal of luxury is being redefined to include durability and functionality. Traditionally, luxury items were prized for their exclusivity and ornamental value, but the robust luxury trend shifts the focus towards products that offer practical longevity. This shift caters to a growing consumer base that values sustainability and efficiency alongside traditional luxury.</p> \n<p>As lifestyles become more dynamic, there is a notable demand for products that seamlessly integrate into various aspects of daily life without sacrificing style or quality.

It emphasizes a more personalized approach to skincare and wellness, aligning products with the body\u2019s natural rhythms.

Hormonal fluctuations and beauty needs2. Cycle-syncing solutions for every phase3. Pre- and postpartum beauty support4. Navigating menopause with grace and beauty5. Final thoughts</p> \n<h2>Understanding hormonal fluctuations and beauty needs</h2> \n<p>Next-generation beauty and wellness brands are pioneering a holistic strategy towards hormonal fluctuations, introducing first-aid solutions aimed at alleviating the symptomatic changes affecting skin and hair health as well as overall wellbeing. This innovative approach is grounded in a deepened comprehension of how hormonal shifts during critical life stages\u2014menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause\u2014profoundly influence beauty and wellness routines. By addressing these changes, brands offer targeted support that harmonizes with the body\u2019s natural cycles, thereby enhancing individual care practices.</p> \n<p>The surge in hormone-balancing hacks across digital platforms, from Google searches to TikTok trends, underscores a growing consumer demand for products that cater to hormonal needs. Despite this, a significant knowledge gap persists. A survey highlighted that nearly half of the women aged 30 to 60 experienced hormonal imbalances, yet a majority recognized the cause of their symptoms only retrospectively. This trend, increasingly acknowledged by Millennials and Gen X, is also beginning to resonate with Gen Z, indicating a broad market opportunity that spans across diverse demographic groups. With key markets in North America and EMEA, particularly the US and UK, and a notable presence of symptomatic relief solutions in the APAC region, the hormonal beauty trend is poised for enduring growth, promising to redefine beauty standards across multiple product categories.</p> \n<h2>Cycle-syncing solutions for every phase</h2> \n<p>Cycle-syncing solutions in beauty are addressing the dynamic needs of individuals throughout the four distinct phases of the menstrual cycle, recognizing the varied skin changes that occur. During the menstrual phase, skin tends to become dry and dull due to decreased levels of estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, while the follicular phase sees a boost in collagen production thanks to increased estrogen levels. The ovulation and luteal phases, on the other hand, lead to peak levels of progesterone, resulting in oilier, breakout-prone skin. Brands like Typology, Fewe, and Rael are at the forefront of this trend, offering phase-specific products such as serums, masks, mists, and creams designed to counterbalance these hormonal shifts with targeted ingredients.</p> \n<p>Beyond skincare, the concept of cycle-syncing extends to overall wellness, with a focus on addressing hormonal imbalances, acne, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms through comprehensive solutions. For instance, Looni\u2019s Balance Beam Mood Complex is tailored to alleviate menstrual-related mood swings, cravings, and irritability. Safety and expert endorsement are critical in this space, as seen with Dutch brand Sabi, whose products are vetted by medical professionals and free from endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This holistic approach is not limited to skincare; it also includes hair care, where products like Honeyque\u2019s Honey+Collagen Shampoo cater to the hormonal fluctuations affecting hair texture and moisture, thus embracing a full-circle view of hormonal beauty care.</p> \n<h2>Pre- and postpartum beauty support</h2> \n<p>The hormonal landscape during pregnancy undergoes profound shifts, primarily due to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, affecting individuals in myriad ways. This period necessitates a nuanced approach to beauty and wellness, where the safety and efficacy of products are of paramount importance. Brands are urged to adopt a careful stance, ensuring that product formulations are devoid of potentially harmful ingredients like retinoids, chemical sunscreens, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, which could adversely affect both the pregnant individual and the developing baby. Instead, there\u2019s a pivot towards gentle, alternative actives, exemplified by products like Ignae\u2019s Regenerating Body Oil, which uses bakuchiol, a safer retinol alternative, to cater to the delicate needs of this demographic.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the beauty industry is beginning to embrace the concept of trimester-specific care, acknowledging that each stage of pregnancy brings its own set of hormonal changes and challenges. Brands like Perelel in the United States are leading the charge with supplements tailored to the unique needs of each trimester, ensuring that pregnant individuals receive the most appropriate support at every stage. This trend extends beyond skincare, with innovations in intimate care and hair wellness, as seen with Naydaya\u2019s Vagina Victory Oil for estrogen-induced vaginal dryness and Nutrafol\u2019s postpartum supplements designed to support hair health, showcasing a comprehensive approach to pre- and postpartum beauty care.</p> \n<h2>Menopause relief with grace and beauty</h2> \n<p>The journey into menopause brings forth a spectrum of physical changes attributed to the decline in estrogen levels, highlighting the necessity for specialized beauty and wellness solutions. As collagen production diminishes, individuals may encounter hair thinning, loss of skin volume, increased appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, dryness, and age spots. Brands like Balance Me are innovating with products like the Tripeptide Plumping Cloud Cream, which incorporates tripeptides, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid to specifically target these hormonal-induced skin concerns. The approach to menopausal care emphasizes the diversity of experiences, advocating for personalized solutions to cater to the varied symptoms one might face.</p> \n<p>To effectively address these challenges, the beauty industry is adopting multifaceted strategies that include not just topical treatments but also diagnostic tools and wellness products designed to provide holistic support. For instance, Veracity offers an at-home saliva test to tailor skincare and supplement recommendations to an individual\u2019s hormonal profile, ensuring a customized regimen. Symptomatic relief extends to addressing hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, loss of libido, and vaginal dryness, with innovative solutions like Miseico\u2019s Aromatherapy Elixirs offering cooling, hormone-free, and stress-relieving benefits. This era of menopausal care is about empowering individuals with knowledge and options, from protective and restorative skincare ingredients to leveraging technology and cross-industry collaborations for a truly tailored and supportive menopausal journey.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>The rise of life stage hormonal beauty is a testament to the evolving landscape of personal care, where the intimate understanding of one\u2019s body and hormonal fluctuations paves the way for more inclusive and effective beauty solutions. For online retailers, this trend not only signifies a shift towards more personalized and conscious consumer experiences but also opens up a realm of opportunities to cater to a diverse range of needs and preferences within the beauty industry. This evolution in the beauty industry is a testament to the power of science and innovation in enhancing our lives, making beauty a truly holistic pursuit.</p> \n"}]}

While many use makeup to create this freckled look, some go as far as tattooing on freckles.</p> \n<h2>Popularity of faux freckles</h2> \n<p>Faux freckles have become incredibly popular in 2023. As of the fall,#FauxFreckleshas over 739 million views on TikTok, while#FakeFreckleshas 139 million views, and#HowToMakeFauxFreckleshas over 1.7 million views.</p> \n<h3>What makes this trend so popular?</h3> \n<p>Trends espousing the inherent beauty of natural features have been on the rise over the last year, and faux freckles are a great way to enhance a no-makeup-makeup look. Many attempt to capture this look because freckles are often associated with youth, playfulness, and innocence.</p> \n<p>Faux freckles are also an opportunity for people to express themselves. Some go for a less natural and more expressive look, for example, theserainbow tattoo freckles. While colorful and realistic freckle tattoos have become popular, others prefer bright, expressive freckle looks with additional makeup as well, like in the photo below.</p> \n<h3>What is freckle tattooing?</h3> \n<p>Freckle tattooing is done in the same manner as eyebrow microblading. This semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing technique involves using a small handheld tool with fine needles to deposit pigment into the superficial layers of the skin that can last for one to three years.</p> \n<p>Tattooing is a great option for those who want to fully embrace the freckled look and don\u2019t have the patience or time to reapply them regularly.</p> \n<h2>Faux freckles and celebrities</h2> \n<p>With the faux freckle trend taking over social media, we are seeing more celebrities embracing their natural freckles.</p> \n<p>For example, Pamela Anderson, known for her signature \u201990s dark, smokey eyes and glossy lips, has shifted to an all-natural look, as seen in a recent Instagram post showcasing her freckles and radiant skin.</p> \n<p>The 56-year-old actress attributes this change to the passing of her makeup artist, Alexis Vogel, and describes going makeup-free as \u201cfreeing, fun, and a little rebellious.\u201d Fans praised her natural appearance in the comments, expressing love for her freckles.

However, it\u2019s important not to go too dark, so black tones are generally out of the question.</p> \n<p>Of course, powder eyeshadow in brown tones does work, too, but the application process is more challenging, and setting them may be important to ensure that they last.</p> \n<h3>2. Fake freckle pen</h3> \n<p>Some beauty brands offerfreckle pens or markersspecifically designed for creating faux freckles. These products often come in a variety of shades and are formulated to provide a natural look.</p> \n<h3>3.

However, it\u2019s imperative to know the source of the product, as not all henna products are made for the skin, and others have chemicals that can be toxic or cause irritation, particularly for those with sensitive skin.</p> \n<p>If henna is going to be used on the face, it should be made with natural ingredients and always be patch-tested before use.</p> \n<h2>Men and the faux freckle beauty trend</h2> \n<p>In the last several years, men have been embracing self-care and beauty trends more than ever, and this too stretches to faux freckles.

Prejuvenation involves adopting skincare routines and treatments early in life to delay the appearance of aging signs such as wrinkles and fine lines, a strategy that contrasts with the corrective measures preferred by previous generations\u200b (Oxford Academic)\u200b.</p> \n<p>This demographic is increasingly investing in high-performance skincare and wellness products, driven by a desire to maintain their youthful appearance for as long as possible.

Here\u2019s a list of common prejuvenation methods:</p> \n<p>Sun Protection: Regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreens to protect against UVA and UVB rays, which can cause premature aging and damage to the skin.</p> \n<p>Antioxidant-rich Skincare: Incorporating products that contain antioxidants such as vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid to fight free radicals and environmental aggressors.</p> \n<p>Moisturizers and Hydrators: Using products that keep the skin hydrated and strengthen the skin barrier, including those with hyaluronic acid and ceramides.</p> \n<p>Retinoids: Early use of retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) to promote skin renewal, improve texture, and prevent wrinkles.</p> \n<p>Gentle Exfoliation: Regularly removing dead skin cells to promote cell turnover, using chemical exfoliants like AHAs (e.g., glycolic acid) and BHAs (e.g., salicylic acid).</p> \n<h2>The drivers behind Gen Z\u2019s shift to early anti-aging</h2> \n<p>Several factors contribute to Gen Z\u2019s proactive stance on aging. The delay of traditional adulthood milestones allows for a longer focus on youthfulness, while health anxiety, exacerbated by the pandemic, has spotlighted the importance of holistic wellbeing. Technological advancements and the viral old age filter on social media platforms like TikTok have further motivated Gen Z to take early action against aging.</p> \n<p>The hashtag #anti-aging has garnered billions of views on TikTok, emphasizing the widespread demand for treatments that prevent rather than correct the signs of aging. This indicates a significant cultural shift towards valuing a youthful appearance, driven by a desire for self-expression and influenced by social media and the fear of missing out on experiences associated with youth\u200b (Naisture)\u200b. Additionally, the concept of the $5,000 face has normalized high-maintenance beauty routines, reinforcing the trend towards preventative care.</p> \n<h2>Key themes in prejuvenation products and strategies</h2> \n<p>Prejuvenation-focused products and strategies are evolving to meet Gen Z\u2019s demands for comprehensive, science-backed solutions that support long-term health and beauty.

The shift towards preventative measures over corrective ones signifies a deeper understanding and appreciation of long-term health and aesthetic well-being. Brands looking to capitalise on the prejuvenation trend should focus on supportive, non-shaming messaging that emphasizes health and well-being. Offering evidence-backed products that address both skin and overall physical health, while also tapping into high-performance formulations for environmental protection, will be crucial. Creating holistic regimes that cater to the inside-out approach of healthy aging will resonate with Gen Z consumers seeking comprehensive solutions.</p> \n"}]}

Biotechnology is ushering in a new era of sustainable, effective collagen ingredients that promise to shake up skincare, haircare, supplements, and beyond. As consumers demand greater transparency and science-backed solutions, innovative brands are harnessing biotech to create collagen that checks all the boxes: vegan, eco-friendly, and clinically proven. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the key trends driving the collagen boom and explore how cutting-edge advances are opening up exciting new opportunities for products that not only deliver real results, but align with evolving ethics and values. Get ready to discover the future of collagen.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents1. The vegan collagen solution2. Marine collagen gets a sustainability makeover3. Collagen beauty supplements: separating fact from fiction4. Collagen moves beyond skincare5. The future is biotech</p> \n<h2>The vegan collagen solution</h2> \n<p>Marine collagen has long been hailed as a miracle ingredient, thanks to its high concentration of type I collagen, which is the most abundant form found in human skin. It\u2019s also become a go-to for brands looking to cater to Muslim consumers, as it can be certified halal, unlike its bovine-derived counterpart. But as the demand for marine collagen soars, so too do concerns about the sustainability of sourcing from fish and other ocean creatures.</p> \n<p>Enter the next wave of marine collagen: lab-grown alternatives that are crafted from fish cells, rather than relying on wild-caught or farmed fish. These bioengineered ingredients offer a more eco-friendly solution, reducing the strain on fragile marine ecosystems while still delivering the potent benefits of traditional marine collagen.</p> \n<p>But the advantages of biotech marine collagen don\u2019t stop there. By growing collagen in a controlled lab environment, scientists can create a more stable and heat-resistant ingredient that can withstand the rigors of product formulation. This means brands can harness the power of marine collagen in a wider range of products, from serums to creams to masks.</p> \n<p>As consumers become increasingly savvy about the environmental impact of their beauty choices, brands that prioritize sustainability and transparency in their marine collagen sourcing will have a distinct advantage. By embracing the latest biotech innovations and partnering with reputable suppliers, brands can create products that deliver unparalleled results while also aligning with their customers\u2019 values.</p> \n<h2>Marine collagen gets a sustainability makeover</h2> \n<p>Collagen supplements have exploded in popularity, with everyone from celebrities to wellness influencers touting their skin-transforming benefits. It\u2019s no wonder the global collagen supplement market is expected to reach a staggering $7.2 billion by 2028. But amidst all the hype, there\u2019s a glaring lack of scientific evidence to back up the claims that ingesting collagen can actually boost the body\u2019s natural collagen production.</p> \n<p>This puts brands in a tricky position. On one hand, the demand for collagen supplements shows no signs of slowing down. On the other, making unsubstantiated claims about their benefits could erode trust with consumers and even attract unwanted attention from regulators. The key is to focus on transparency and education, providing clear information about what collagen supplements can and cannot do.</p> \n<p>One way brands can navigate this challenge is by formulating supplements with ingredients that have been scientifically proven to support collagen synthesis, such as vitamin C. By shifting the focus to these evidence-backed actives, brands can create products that deliver real results without relying on overblown claims.</p> \n<p>Partnering with trusted experts, such as dermatologists and nutritionists, can also help brands build credibility in the crowded collagen supplement space. These collaborations not only lend scientific authority to products, but also provide valuable opportunities for consumer education. By empowering customers with knowledge, brands can foster long-term loyalty and trust, even as the collagen craze continues to evolve.</p> \n<h2>Collagen beauty supplements: separating fact from fiction</h2> \n<p>Collagen may be best known for its skin-plumping properties, but its benefits extend far beyond the face. This protein is a crucial building block for healthy hair, nails, bones, and joints, making it a true head-to-toe beauty hero. As consumers become increasingly aware of collagen\u2019s full-body benefits, savvy brands are expanding their offerings to target concerns beyond the traditional realm of skincare.</p> \n<p>One of the most exciting areas of growth is in haircare, where collagen is emerging as a key ingredient for promoting thick, lustrous locks. By harnessing the power of collagen-boosting actives like biotin and vitamin C, innovative hair products can help to strengthen strands from the inside out, reducing breakage and promoting a healthy, flake-free scalp.</p> \n<p>Oral care is another frontier where collagen is making waves. With gum health emerging as a top concern for many consumers, toothpastes and mouthwashes infused with marine collagen are showing promise for reducing inflammation and promoting a healthy oral microbiome. And thanks to advances in biotechnology, these products can now be formulated with lab-grown collagen that offers superior purity and potency.</p> \n<p>As the collagen craze continues to gain momentum, expect to see a surge of targeted solutions that harness the power of this wonder protein to address specific concerns, from brittle nails to thinning hair to creaky joints. By staying attuned to the latest scientific advances and consumer demands, brands can create innovative collagen products that deliver transformative results from head to toe.</p> \n<h2>Collagen moves beyond skincare</h2> \n<p>The future of collagen lies in the hands of biotechnology. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge science, brands can create collagen ingredients that are not only more sustainable and effective than their traditional counterparts, but also tailored to address specific skin concerns. These bioengineered marvels represent a quantum leap forward for the beauty industry, offering unprecedented possibilities for innovation.</p> \n<p>One of the most exciting advantages of biotech collagen is its ability to be customized for different applications. Whether it\u2019s a serum designed to target deep wrinkles or a supplement formulated to promote joint health, these next-generation ingredients can be fine-tuned to deliver targeted benefits with unparalleled precision. This opens up a world of possibilities for brands looking to create highly personalized products that cater to the unique needs of every customer.</p> \n<p>But the benefits of biotech collagen go beyond just performance. By growing collagen in a lab setting, brands can sidestep many of the ethical and environmental concerns associated with animal-derived ingredients. This not only appeals to the growing number of consumers who prioritize sustainability and cruelty-free products, but also helps to future-proof the industry against the challenges of climate change and resource scarcity.</p> \n<p>Of course, embracing biotech collagen isn\u2019t as simple as just swapping out old ingredients for new ones. To fully realize the potential of these groundbreaking actives, brands must be willing to invest in rigorous clinical testing, partner with reputable biotech firms, and educate consumers about the science behind their products. But for those who are willing to put in the work, the rewards are immense: a new generation of collagen-powered products that push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in beauty.</p> \n<h2>The future is biotech</h2> \n<p>The collagen revolution is no fleeting trend \u2013 it\u2019s a seismic shift that\u2019s transforming the very foundations of the beauty industry. As consumers become increasingly savvy about the science behind their skincare, brands that fail to embrace the power of biotechnology risk being left behind. The future belongs to those who are willing to invest in cutting-edge research, transparent sourcing, and clinically proven efficacy.</p> \n<p>But this revolution isn\u2019t just about creating better products \u2013 it\u2019s about building a better world. By harnessing the power of biotech collagen, brands have the opportunity to not only improve the lives of their customers, but also to make a positive impact on the planet. Whether it\u2019s reducing the carbon footprint of ingredient sourcing or eliminating the need for animal-derived materials, these innovative actives offer a path forward that\u2019s both sustainable and ethical.</p> \n<p>As the collagen market continues to evolve at breakneck speed, it\u2019s clear that the winners will be those brands that can stay ahead of the curve. This means keeping a finger on the pulse of the latest scientific breakthroughs, partnering with experts who can help navigate the complexities of biotech, and always putting the needs of the consumer first.</p> \n<p>The collagen revolution is here, and it\u2019s just getting started. As the boundaries between science and beauty continue to blur, the possibilities for innovation are endless. For brands that are willing to embrace the power of biotech, the future looks brighter than ever before \u2013 not just for their bottom line, but for the health and well-being of people and planet alike.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The collagen revolution is ushering in a new era of beauty, one where cutting-edge science and sustainability go hand in hand. As biotechnology unlocks unprecedented possibilities for innovation, brands that embrace this shift will be poised to create products that not only deliver transformative results, but also align with the values of modern consumers. By harnessing the power of biotech collagen, the industry can move towards a future where efficacy, ethics, and environmental responsibility are no longer mutually exclusive. The key is to stay attuned to the ever-evolving landscape of scientific discovery while always keeping the needs and desires of the customer at the forefront. The collagen revolution is here \u2013 and it\u2019s just getting started.</p> \n"}]}

As brands face these multifaceted challenges, the necessity for innovative solutions that bridge consumer expectations with sustainable practices is more crucial than ever. This article explores how forward-thinking brands are revolutionizing their formulations, packaging, and business practices to not only meet these demands but to thrive, ensuring both sustainability and consumer trust.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents\u25cf Stricter regulations and supply chain challenges\u25cf Innovations in product longevity\u25cf Bridging the say-buy gap through sustainable design\u25cf Future-proofing the beauty industry: actions and trends</p> \n<h2>Stricter regulations and supply chain challenges</h2> \n<p>As global regulatory bodies tighten the reins on cosmetic formulations and packaging standards, beauty brands face significant pressure to adapt swiftly. These enhanced regulations aim to ensure consumer safety and environmental sustainability but often result in complex compliance requirements. For instance, the EU\u2019s recent adjustments to cosmetic preservatives under Annex V of the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 have prompted brands to reformulate products to meet safety standards without compromising quality.</p> \n<p>Compounding these regulatory challenges are the ongoing supply chain disruptions triggered by global economic volatilities, such as trade conflicts and unexpected pandemic-related shutdowns. These disruptions have highlighted the fragility of globalized supply networks, pushing cosmetic companies to reevaluate their supply chain resilience. Brands like Impartialists and Synergists, known for their fact-driven and eco-conscious consumer bases, are particularly scrutinized, forcing them to navigate these disruptions carefully to maintain trust and market stability. The dual pressures of compliance and supply chain unpredictability make it imperative for brands to enhance their agility and foresight in product development and distribution strategies.</p> \n<h2>Innovations in product longevity</h2> \n<p>In response to these challenges, the beauty industry is witnessing a paradigm shift towards enhancing product longevity. This movement is not only a response to consumer demand for durability and value but also a strategic alignment with global sustainability goals. Brands are increasingly focusing on formulations that offer extended usability without compromising on safety or aesthetic appeal. For example, Faber-Castell Cosmetics in Germany has innovated a refillable cosmetics pencil that allows users to replace colors without discarding the entire product. This not only reduces waste but also caters to consumer desires for customizable and sustainable beauty solutions.</p> \n<p>Moreover, American brand Neen has taken durability to the next level with its silicone packaging solutions that are designed to withstand physical stress\u2014demonstrated through rigorous tests of throwing, shaking, and bending\u2014without damage. These advancements in product design reflect a broader industry trend towards \u2018slow beauty,\u2019 where the focus is on quality and sustainability rather than rapid consumption. Such innovations are crucial in positioning brands as leaders in sustainability, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers and setting a new standard in the cosmetic market for longevity and eco-friendliness.</p> \n<h2>Bridging the say-buy gap through sustainable design</h2> \n<p>In the quest to reduce environmental impact and enhance consumer satisfaction, the beauty industry is increasingly embedding sustainability into product design. This approach not only addresses the environmental concerns but also taps into the consumer\u2019s desire for ethical products without sacrificing convenience or aesthetics. A prime example is Brazilian brand Amokarit\u00e9, which has developed the zero-waste 3 in 1 Multifunctional Solid Lipsticks. These products feature solid pigmented balls, available in eight shades, designed to fully exhaust their use without leaving residual waste. They can be applied on the eyes, lips, and cheeks, showcasing versatility and commitment to zero waste.</p> \n<p>This product design cleverly lessens the \u2018moral injury\u2019 consumers might feel when purchasing products that do not align with their personal ethics. By reducing the eco-accountability required from consumers, such innovations bridge the say-buy gap, where customers\u2019 purchasing intentions align more closely with their values. Furthermore, these sustainable design choices are increasingly influential in purchasing decisions, as consumers look for brands that actively reduce the environmental footprint without compromising the quality or effectiveness of the product.</p> \n<h2>Future-proofing the beauty industry: actions and trends</h2> \n<p>The beauty industry\u2019s future hinges on its ability to anticipate and adapt to evolving consumer expectations and regulatory environments. Leading this charge are initiatives like the Traceability Alliance for Sustainable Cosmetics (TRASCE), which includes prominent brands such as Chanel, Dior, and Est\u00e9e Lauder. TRASCE aims to enhance transparency and traceability across the supply chain, improving both consumer trust and regulatory compliance. By mapping the origins and lifecycle of beauty products, these brands are not only meeting increased regulatory demands but are also providing consumers with the assurance that products are ethically sourced and produced.</p> \n<p>Innovation continues with product formulations and delivery methods that aim to extend longevity and reduce waste. For instance, Judydoll\u2019s Glamorous Glaze makeup collection features freeze-dried powder technology that extends the product\u2019s shelf life and reduces the need for preservatives. Similarly, Korean brand Neogen has replaced traditional mascara wands with a novel metal applicator brush that can be reused and cleaned, significantly reducing waste associated with daily beauty routines.</p> \n<p>These innovations demonstrate a significant shift towards more sustainable practices in the beauty industry. By investing in such trends, brands not only ensure their market relevance and compliance with stringent regulations but also lead the way in the industry\u2019s evolution towards sustainability and consumer-centricity. As these practices become more mainstream, they will likely set new standards for product design and corporate responsibility in the beauty industry.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>As the beauty industry navigates through the complexities of stricter regulations and supply chain challenges, its commitment to enhancing cosmetic longevity and sustainability becomes ever more critical. By innovating product designs, such as refillable components and durable packaging, and embedding sustainability into core business practices, brands are setting new standards for the industry. Initiatives like TRASCE are pioneering transparency and fostering trust, ensuring that the beauty sector not only meets current demands but also anticipates future trends. These efforts are essential in building a resilient, sustainable, and consumer-centric beauty industry that not only survives but thrives in the face of global challenges.</p> \n"}]}

This transformation has been long overdue, and as the industry becomes more aware of its impact on society, brands are redefining beauty by embracing inclusivity.</p> \n<p>So, let\u2019s talk about why embracing inclusivity as a business is critical, particularly in the beauty industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat is inclusive beauty?Why is embracing inclusivity critical in the beauty industry?How to be an inclusive beauty brandFinal thoughts</p> \n<h2>What is inclusive beauty?</h2> \n<p>Inclusivity refers to a commitment to embracing and representing the diversity of human experiences, appearances, and identities. It involves acknowledging and celebrating the uniqueness of individuals, irrespective of their race, ethnicity, gender, age, body type, abilities, or any other characteristic.</p> \n<p>In a genuinely inclusive beauty industry, all individuals should feel seen, valued, and catered to in terms of product offerings and marketing representation.</p> \n<h2>Why is embracing inclusivity critical in the beauty industry?</h2> \n<h3>1. Representation matters</h3> \n<p>One of the most significant reasons inclusivity is crucial in the beauty industry is the undeniable importance of representation. For far too long, beauty standards have been narrowly defined, excluding a vast array of ethnicities, body types, and gender identities. The lack of representation can be disheartening and alienating for those who don\u2019t fit the conventional mold.</p> \n<p>When people see themselves represented in beauty campaigns, advertisements, and product offerings, it sends a powerful message\u2014that they are seen and acknowledged, and their unique beauty is celebrated. This boosts confidence, helps break down stereotypes, and fosters a more inclusive society.</p> \n<h3>2. Meeting diverse consumer needs</h3> \n<p>The global consumer base is incredibly diverse, and beauty brands are starting to recognize that catering to this diversity is not just a moral imperative but also a smart business move. Consumers want to see products that meet their specific needs, whether in terms of skin tone, hair type, or cultural preferences. In a2023 report, Mintel noted that 53% of consumers struggle to find beauty products that match their skin tone.</p> \n<p>Embracing inclusivity in product lines not only broadens a brand\u2019s appeal but also opens up new markets. As the world becomes more interconnected, beauty brands that fail to adapt to changing demographics risk losing a significant portion of their potential customer base.</p> \n<p>While meeting diverse consumer needs is essential, doing so simply based on business financial gain is not what inclusivity is about. Consumers actively seek out genuinely inclusive brands. A recent survey conducted by Accenture found that 41% of consumers have shifted away from a brand due to their perceived lack of diversity and inclusion. Furthermore, consumers are so dedicated to authenticity that, according toMintel, 78% want to see unedited images in beauty advertisements.</p> \n<h3>3. Challenging beauty stereotypes</h3> \n<p>Traditional beauty standards have perpetuated harmful stereotypes, leading to a narrow and often unattainable definition of beauty. Inclusivity in the beauty industry challenges these stereotypes, encouraging a more realistic and diverse representation of what is considered beautiful.</p> \n<p>By featuring a wide range of skin tones, body shapes, and gender expressions, beauty brands send the message that beauty comes in many forms. This promotes self-acceptance and encourages a cultural shift towards celebrating differences rather than conforming to a singular, often unattainable, ideal.</p> \n<h3>4. Boosting self-esteem and mental well-being</h3> \n<p>The impact of beauty standards on mental health cannot be overstated. Constant exposure to a limited and idealized version of beauty can lead to low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and even mental health issues, particularly among young people. Negative body image impacts everyone, with31% of teenagers and 35% of adultsfeeling ashamed or depressed because of how they perceive their bodies.</p> \n<p>Embracing inclusivity in the beauty industry helps dismantle the harmful narrative that only a certain look is desirable. When individuals see diverse representations of beauty, it promotes a more positive self-image and contributes to improved mental well-being. This is especially important in a world where social media and advertising heavily influence perceptions of beauty.</p> \n<h3>5. Social responsibility and ethical branding</h3> \n<p>Consumers today are more socially conscious than ever before. They want tosupport brands that align with their values, and inclusivity is increasingly becoming a non-negotiable aspect of those values. Brands that fail to embrace inclusivity risk being perceived as out of touch or, worse, perpetrators of harmful beauty standards.</p> \n<p>By prioritizing inclusivity, beauty brands demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility; this helps build brand loyalty and contributes to the broader societal shift towards more ethical and responsible consumerism.</p> \n<h2>How to be an inclusive beauty brand</h2> \n<p>Now that you understand inclusivity and its role in the beauty industry, the critical question is: how can you make your brand more inclusive? Here are some things to consider that can make your brand more inclusive.</p> \n<h3>Product range</h3> \n<p>Inclusive beauty means offering products that cater to a wide range of skin tones, hair textures, and other unique characteristics. This includes developing makeup shades that suit a diverse array of complexions, hair care products for different textures, and skincare solutions that address a variety of needs.</p> \n<p>Inclusivity in the beauty industry also involves the language used in product descriptions. Descriptions focusing solely on traditionally desirable features may alienate individuals who don\u2019t conform to those standards.</p> \n<h3>Representation in marketing</h3> \n<p>Inclusivity extends to marketing and advertising efforts. Brands prioritizing inclusivity ensure their campaigns feature models and influencers from various backgrounds and body types, showcasing a broad spectrum of beauty. This representation helps challenge narrow beauty standards and promotes a more realistic and diverse perception of beauty.</p> \n<h3>Inclusive language</h3> \n<p>Inclusivity in marketing extends beyond visual representation and should prioritize inclusive language. As mentioned above, inclusive language can play a critical role in product descriptions, but how else can we think about inclusive language?</p> \n<p>Like many others, the beauty industry is evolving to be more gender-inclusive. Recognizing and respecting diverse gender identities is crucial to language usage.</p> \n<p>Brands can adopt inclusive language by using gender-neutral pronouns or addressing their audience with terms like \u201ceveryone\u201d or \u201call individuals.\u201d This helps create an environment where people of all gender identities feel acknowledged and valued.</p> \n<p>Inclusivity also extends to ensuring that language is accessible to everyone. Complex or exclusive terminology can create barriers for individuals. Using positive and clear language helps ensure the messaging is inclusive and easily understood. This approach is particularly relevant in product instructions, as it ensures that consumers of diverse backgrounds can confidently use and enjoy the products without feeling excluded.</p> \n<h3>Workforce diversity</h3> \n<p>Inclusive beauty also involves fostering diversity within the industry\u2019s workforce. This includes hiring individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, as well as ensuring that decision-makers and creative teams reflect the diversity of the consumer base.</p> \n<h3>Listen to feedback</h3> \n<p>Inclusivity also involves an open and receptive approach to consumer feedback. Brands that actively seek and listen to feedback can refine their language to better resonate with their audience.</p> \n<p>If consumers express concerns or suggest improvements related to inclusive language, brands can demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity by adapting their communication accordingly.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Inclusivity should always be considered when creating and marketing products. This is especially true in the beauty industry, where the impact on the community is huge. But inclusivity is not just about creating inclusive products and marketing campaigns; it\u2019s about creating a safe and accepting environment for all.</p> \n"}]}

They give hairstyles neat finishing while increasing their wear time. But like other things in life, there\u2019s no one hairspray that\u2019s a one-size-fits-all product. Different consumers require options unique to keep their hairdos in place, leading to an incredibly high variety of hairsprays in the market. This article will spill the tea on the top areas to focus on when picking the best hair sprays for consumers in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the hair spray marketEverything to know about choosing hair sprays in 2024Last words</p> \n<h2>An overview of the hair spray market</h2> \n<p>Hair sprays are very common cosmetic products critical to many hair styling kits. For this reason, they have one of the biggest beauty markets worldwide. The globalhair spray market\u2019sworth in 2022 was US$ 10.1 billion, with experts predicting it will readjust to US$ 20.5 billion by 2030 at a 7.89% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The rising influence of the entertainment industry is one of the major drivers pushing market growth. More consumers are also becoming aware of various hairstyles achievable with hair sprays, which experts say will propel demand.</p> \n<p>Based on the above report, North America emerged as the highest revenue generator in 2022, with experts predicting it will maintain dominance over the forecast period. Europe is the second leading market, also generating significant revenue in 2022. Also, synthetic hair sprays accounted for the highest market share in 2022.</p> \n<h2>Everything to know about choosing hair sprays in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Hair type</h3> \n<p>Choosing the best hair spray for consumers requires considering their hair type. Do they have curly hair? Or straight, fizzy, flat, long, or short? It will help determine the best one to offer or make available online. Usually, they will want one of the following types:</p> \n<p>Are consumers struggling with frizzy hair? They will need something to keep their hair in place without looking disheveled later. And that\u2019s whereanti-frizz hair sprayscome in. These products can flatten all that pesky frizz, maintaining women\u2019s hairstyles smooth throughout the day. Anti-frizz hair sprays are also must-haves for summer or rainy days.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, consumers want their hairdos to look fuller for a more attractive style. In such cases, hair sprays withvolumizing propertieswill do a great job adding more body to their hair. But, since these sprays add extra weight to the head, experts only recommend them for straight or very fine hair. Volumizing hair sprays are not great for curly or thick hair\u2014they will make them look frizzy or puffy.</p> \n<p>When consumers just want their hair to feel and look more alive, they willneed hairsprayswith some more shine. These hairsprays help women maintain their hair\u2019s natural radiance and glow, especially after pampering it with hairdryers or flat irons.</p> \n<p>These hair spraysare among the most common (and popular) types. They are the go-to for keeping any hairstyle locked securely for hours. And in contrast to other hair sprays, control variants can work for all consumers. Many women also love them for their incredible versatility, allowing them to rock any style they want.</p> \n<p>These spraysare also multi-functional. While their primary role is styling and smoothing hair, they can also reduce static and lock hair in place after using straighteners or curling irons. Setting hair sprays are perfect for fine or straight hair and can handle even the lightest strands.</p> \n<h3>Hold strength</h3> \n<p>After choosing the best options according to hair type, the next step is determining the style consumers want to achieve. And the strength of the hair spray hold is the first thing to consider for this aspect. Hair sprays can have up to seven hold strengths, ranging from light to ultimate.</p> \n<p>Women looking for natural-looking hairstyles or a way to stop stubborn flyaways won\u2019t need anything more thanlight hold strengths. Because it\u2019s not too strong, ladies can restyle their hair whenever possible. For this reason, most consumers prefer them for transitioning from daytime styles to killer evening looks.</p> \n<p>While not as light as the previous hold strength,medium hair spraysstill offer control, movement, and bounce\u2014and at the same time, too! Ladies hoping to rock smooth hairstyles, like sleek ponytails or slicked-back hair, will love this hold strength. Even better, this is the perfect hold strength for consumers with frizzy hair\u2014it\u2019ll keep all those stubborn strands in place.</p> \n<p>Do ladies need more help in the volume department? What they need is the mighty boost hold. These hairsprays give the hair all the hold it needs to rock thosevoluminous hairstyles(like beehives and bouffants). Despite being level three hold hair spray, these products won\u2019t make the hair sticky and stiff.</p> \n<p>If consumers want more control than medium sprays offer, they can\u2019t go wrong with extra-holdhairsprays. These are the top choices for securing full glam hairstyles like waves and curls. Extra hold sprays are the go-to for fabulous, long-lasting hairstyles without any annoying extra weight.</p> \n<p>Entering the realm of creating hair shapes required something stronger than the previous hold strengths. So, when consumers want bow-style updos or flower-shaped braids, they\u2019ll reach for a can offirm-hold hair sprays. These products will help ladies nail their look, providing up to 24-hour humidity protection\u2014all without leaving sticky residues.</p> \n<p>Fancy updos are a popular sight on luxury occasions. And what do fancy updos need? An extreme hold hair spray, that\u2019s what! If ladies want that intricate chignon or stylishly braided updo, they require the strong, long-lasting hold of extreme hairspray to keep their style secure all day long.</p> \n<p>Consumers looking for the strongest hold will feel at ease with ultimate holdhairsprays. These bad boys are excellent at holding more sophisticated updos like knots, buns, and braids. The best part? It lets women move around as much as they like without worrying about their style running amok.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>Another to check when choosing hair spray is the ingredients. Consumers want to avoid ingredients that could damage their hair instead of securing it. One common bad ingredient is alcohol, which is notorious for drying out the hair and making it more fragile and brittle.</p> \n<p>For this reason, offering hair sprays without alcohol is a great idea for helping consumers to keep their hair healthy. Instead of alcohol, look for options packed with gentle ingredients like flexible fibers or waxes, giving the hair a strong hold without causing damage. If consumers prefer natural products, business buyers can stock plant extract hair sprays. These not only help style hair but also provide vitamins and minerals to keep it healthy.</p> \n<h3>Finish</h3> \n<p>The kind of finish sprays give is super important for the desired hairstyle. Hence, whatever style consumers have in mind often influences the type of finish they will go for. Here are some options worth considering:</p> \n<p>If consumers want a textured look with minimal shine, hair sprays with a matte finish are an amazing option. They make the preferred style look natural and cool, perfect if ladies like a bit of an edgy look.</p> \n<p>But if consumers want a subtle, less attractive hairstyle, they can\u2019t go wrong with sprays that give a light shine. It adds a classy touch to looks, keeping things glam without being too flashy.</p> \n<p>When super shiny and sleek hairstyles are the goal, hairsprays that make the hair look wet are what consumers need. They give the hair a glossy finish that stands out, great for making a bold statement.</p> \n<h2>Last words</h2> \n<p>Consumers love creating different hairstyles to fit whatever occasion they have in mind! But hairsprays are the only tools they can use to keep that style on their heads for long\u2014otherwise, they see flyaways pop up after some minutes. But, since consumers have different hair types, they often need differenthair spraysto get the best results. But don\u2019t worry. Follow this guide to choose the best hairsprays for target consumers and get maximum return on investment in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

They prefer flaunting their natural lashes and will do what they can to keep them looking amazing. While many products promise full lashes, none is as effective as the trustyeyelash curler.</p> \n<p>These hand-operated tools are the easiest way for women to curl their lashes and create eye-catching lifts (especially when consumers enhance the look with mascara).

However, experts predict the market will reach US $1.66 billion by 2030, growing at a 2.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The market\u2019s growth drivers include rising consciousness about skincare and personal grooming and increasing consumer desirability to look perfect.</p> \n<p>The increasing number of social gatherings is another factor experts predict will boost market growth.

Europe followed closely behind, with an impressive revenue share in 2021.</p> \n<h2>What to factor in when stocking up on eyelash curlers</h2> \n<h3>1. Consider the consumer\u2019s eye shape</h3> \n<p>Many manufacturers may claim theireyelash curlerscater to all eye shapes, but that\u2019s not always the case. Consumers may have certain eye shapes that need special curlers. Keep in mind that each curler comes with a slightly different shape, meaning what works for one person may not work for another.</p> \n<p>But what happens when consumers use the wrong shape? It may pinch the ends of their eyelids (which hurts like hell!) or fail to curl all their lashes. To ensure consumers don\u2019t waste money on the wrong tool and leave angry reviews (or worse, requests for returns), it\u2019s best to stock up onmodelswith curvatures that align with the target\u2019s eye shape.</p> \n<h3>2. The consumer\u2019s lash length matters</h3> \n<p>Long lashes are incredibly easy to curl, but what about those without the same luck? Shorter lashes are notoriously difficult to curl, but such consumers shouldn\u2019t lose hope! Businesses can target such women with minieyelash curlers.</p> \n<p>Mini eyelash curlers are the go-to for short and straight lashes. They can easily reach the smallest and most challenging lashes, helping to curl any tough, stubborn outer and inner lashes delicately. But if targets have regular or long lashes, businesses can stock up on standard-sizedeyelash curlers.</p> \n<h3>3. Heated vs. regular eyelash curlers</h3> \n<p>Regulareyelash curlershave been a staple in women\u2019s makeup kits since 1931, showing how effective they\u2019ve been at creating those sultry, curly, and luscious lashes. However, with technologies advancing rapidly, the new kid on the block has entered the market to make curling lashes even better: the heated eyelash curler.</p> \n<p>Although both products do the same thing, they feel like entirely different tools. For starters, regular eyelash curlers require mechanical force to achieve curly effects, whileheated variantsuse heat.</p> \n<p>Design-wise, both products take different paths. Traditionaleyelash curlershaven\u2019t changed much since the 1930s. They still have their signature curved clamp designs that hold the lashes and curl them upward.</p> \n<p>In contrast,heated eyelash curlersresemble mascara wands. Instead of clamping the lashes, heated curlers require ladies to use them like they\u2019re applying a product and let the heat do the curling.</p> \n<p>Some consumers may be terrified at the idea of using anelectric toolclose to their eyes, but heated variants are incredibly effective at holding curls compared to regular curlers. Nevertheless, the best choice depends on the target consumer\u2019s preferences.</p> \n<p>Ladies prioritizing convenience and effectiveness will most likely prefer heated eyelash curlers, while those who love the old-school way of curling lashes would rather stick to regular variants.</p> \n<h3>4. Metal or plastic lash curlers</h3> \n<p>Now, if target consumers want the trusty mechanical lash curler, businesses must choose between metal and plastic builds.Plastic curlersmay be more affordable than their metal cousins, but they are more fragile.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, getting the perfect curl with plastic variants takes longer and is more tricky to pull off. If target consumers have the budget, they will stick withmetal curlersas they can get more out of them. Plus, they can apply more force for a maximum curling effect without damaging their curler.</p> \n<p>However, plastic lash curlers are the go-to for consumers with sensitive skin. Plastic variants are also the best choice for women who dislike metal.</p> \n<h2>Other things to note before buying eyelash curlers</h2> \n<h3>Rounded rubber pads</h3> \n<p>The ideal eyelash curler should have rounded rubber pads on its base. In this case, the bigger and softer the pad, the better. This often overlooked feature is necessary for the most comfortable usage experience.

They attribute the market\u2019s growth to the rising demand for nail dryers in commercial and residential applications.</p> \n<p>However, UV/LED nail dryers register higher demand surges due to their benefits over fan variants. The household segment also dominates with a 60% market share due to the rising disposable income across developing countries.</p> \n<p>Asia Pacific registered the highest revenue share, and experts suggest the region will maintain its dominance over the forecast period. Research also shows North America will experience the fastest CAGR from 2022 to 2030.</p> \n<h2>Types of nail dryers to buy</h2> \n<h3>Hot air (fan) nail dryers</h3> \n<p>Fan nail dryersare the classic option. Instead of light, these tools use hot air to dry nails after polishing. But there\u2019s a catch: these nail dryers can only quicken the drying process of regular nail polish.</p> \n<p>Regardless,fan nail dryersare affordable, user-friendly, and don\u2019t affect the nails themselves. However, they\u2019re noticeably slower than their successors at preparing nails for flaunting.</p> \n<p>Typically,fan nail dryersare small, handheld devices that are incredibly easy to use. Modern models have various heat settings to accommodate more nail polish varieties and user preferences.</p> \n<p>Some fannail dryerseven feature a \u201ccool\u201d setting to blow cold air instead of hot. As a result, users can enjoy this alternative to setting their polish and preventing smudging.</p> \n<h3>UV nail dryer</h3> \n<p>These nail dryers came after fan variants as a more efficient way for drying nails\u2014and they caught a lot of attention.UV nail dryersare the go-to for drying and hardening gel/shellac nail polish. Why? The UV light causes a chemical reaction with these polishes, creating a hard, durable finish.</p> \n<p>UV nail dryerscome in various shapes and sizes, with some even offering built-in fans to help speed up the drying process. However, drying time varies, depending on the polish type and device wattage.</p> \n<p>Gel polishes may dry within 30 seconds to 2 minutes, while shellac polishes may take up to 5 minutes. Nevertheless,UV nail dryersquickly surpassed their fan counterparts due to their faster drying speed.</p> \n<h3>LED nail dryer</h3> \n<p>Although UVnail dryersbecame a big hit, many concerns about their safety also popped up. While manufacturers say they\u2019re safe, the fact that they use UV light (harmful on long-term exposure) puts them in the black book of many consumers.</p> \n<p>The solution?LED nail dryers. These products are a safer alternative to UV variants as they don\u2019t emit harmful radiation. They also come packed with other benefits, like energy efficiency and faster drying times.</p> \n<p>LED nail dryersare available in various shapes and sizes and can work perfectly at home or in professional salons.Some modelsalso have extra features, like fans, to help circulate air and prevent nails from overheating.</p> \n<h2>A guide to choosing the best nail dryers in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Check the dryer\u2019s dimensions</h3> \n<p>Remember that people have different hand sizes, so checking the product\u2019s dimensions should not be overlooked. If consumers have larger hands or want to fit their whole hand in the dryer, they may need something bigger than the standard size.</p> \n<p>Some lamps, especially the cheaper ones, will only allow four fingers at a time, meaning consumers must cure their thumbs separately. Such lamps also can\u2019t handle pedicures.</p> \n<p>The safest bet is opting for models that can accommodate both hands or one hand for the best experience. Additionally, look for models with removable bottom plates so consumers can show their legs some love, too.</p> \n<p>Note: The best nail dryers can handle both hands at the same time and both feet at the same time\u2014making them the most convenient.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a table showing the average dimensions to look for, depending on the consumer\u2019s hand size.</p> \n<h3>The consumer\u2019s preferred nail polish</h3> \n<p>The type of polish consumers love also determines the kind of nail dryer they\u2019ll need. As mentioned, each nail dryer type handles different nail polishes, meaning what works under one may not work for the other.</p> \n<p>While fan nail dryers can only handle regular nail polish, like lacquer-based formulas, UV variants can handle all UV and LED polishes. LED, on the other hand, can only dry LED polishes.</p> \n<p>This is because polishes come with different formulas requiring various conditions to activate. For instance, lacquer-based polishes can harden from simple warm air but are also the easiest to remove.</p> \n<p>In contrast, gel polishes require precise UV wavelengths to activate specific photoinitiators. These ingredients allow the wavelengths to cure, harden, and make the polishes incredibly durable. While UV nail dryers emit the wavelength for UV and LED gel polishes, LED models can only handle LED-specific polishes.</p> \n<h3>The product\u2019s drying time</h3> \n<p>If consumers are insistent on speed, fan dryers are not for them. The choice here boils down to UV and LED models. But if consumers want a quick drying process, they\u2019ll likely go for LED nail dryers.</p> \n<p>On average, LED nail dryers can cure a layer of polish in 30 seconds, more than 50% faster than a UV dryer\u2019s 90 seconds. In other words, manicures/pedicures with LED dryers would take less than 2 minutes to fully set, while UV variants may take more than 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>That said, if consumers aren\u2019t pressed for time and want the nail polish variety, they\u2019ll prefer UV nail dryers. Despite being slower than their LED counterparts, UV nail dryers still offer a speedy nail drying session.</p> \n<h3>Check bulb duration for UV/LED dryer</h3> \n<p>If sellers are going with UV or LED dryers, they must consider bulb lifespan. Consumers will want something that lasts them for a while. So which is the better option to offer based on bulb duration? The answer is both.</p> \n<p>While LED bulbs boast longer lifespans (up to 50,000 hours) and may never need replacing, UV bulbs are not that bad. Although UV bulbs have a lower 10,000-hour lifespan, they last longer than most people think.</p> \n<p>Replacing a UV bulb for a home-used nail dryer would require frequent usage for years. However, salons and spas may need more replacements depending on consumer frequency.</p> \n<h3>Check for timer features</h3> \n<p>Too much exposure to these dryers can cause adverse effects. UV lights emit harmful radiation that could become harmful with prolonged exposure, while LED lamps may cause the nails to overheat. One way to avoid all these is with timer features.</p> \n<p>Nail dryers with special timers make it easy to program drying sessions. Even the preset options may be all consumers need for the perfect manicure.</p> \n<p>Motion sensors are another great feature that works great with timers. All consumers have to do is slide their hands into the dryer, and it\u2019ll start the process automatically\u2014incredibly convenient!</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Nail dryers are an important part of manicures and pedicures. They\u2019re way better than waiting for nails to dry or trying to blow them dry oneself. Plus, consumers can rest assured they will not smear or smudge their delicate nail art after using these products.</p> \n<p>That said, businesses must consider several factors before entering the nail dryer market. After deciding what their target market are looking for, they can use the tips highlighted in this article to choose the perfect models for their buyers in 2024!</p> \n"}]}

They\u2019ve been a hit since their debut in the 1980s, and their popularity has exploded even more in the modern beauty scene. But with the plethora of lip products available nowadays, it\u2019s easy to get confused when buying.</p> \n<p>Lip balms have become a super lucrative product in the lip care market. Business buyers interested in entering this industry must identify the differences between lip balms and other lip care products. In this regard, they must know how to choose the right lip balm for consumer needs in 2024. Keep reading to gain insights on the subject.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat\u2019s the market size for lip balms?How are lip balms different from other lip products?How should businesses choose the perfect lip balm in 2024?In conclusion</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s the market size for lip balms?</h2> \n<p>Recent reports show that thelip balm marketreached US$ 837.6 million in 2022. However, experts predict it will grow at a 6.55% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2029, nearly crossing US$ 1.3 billion.</p> \n<p>Based on the same report above, there has been a noticeable surge in the lip balm market. The driving force behind this growth is the increasing consciousness regarding grooming and personal care. This observation highlights consumers\u2019 changing trends and demands as they increasingly seek products catering to their care needs. The report also showed that the eco-friendly trend boosts growth, as many consumers demand natural/organic lip balms. And finally, the increasing popularity of lip balms for men greatly impacts the market.</p> \n<p>The report also reveals that colored lip balms are currently the best-selling types, with experts predicting substantial growth in the forecast period. The woman segment dominated the lip balm market in 2022. Asia Pacific had the highest revenue share (over 38.2%), while North America projects to experience the fastest CAGR. Taken together, these stats show that the lip balm industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years.</p> \n<h2>How are lip balms different from other lip products?</h2> \n<p>While other lip products focus on aesthetics,lip balmscater to moisturizing and protecting the lips. Usually, they don\u2019t have colors, but more recent variants include a hint of tint for consumers interested in using them.</p> \n<p>Lip balms and lipsticks may seem similar, but they serve different purposes. Lipsticks aim to provide vibrant colors and textures to the lips, while lip balms are more focused on hydrating and protecting the delicate skin of the lips. In short, consumers looking for a product to keep their lips moisturized and healthy prefer lip balms.</p> \n<p>Whilelip balmscan help handle lip dryness, they may be ineffective if the situation is terrible (like badly chapped lips). In such cases, consumers go for lip salves with more herbal ingredients and oils to heal and relieve the lips. However, they don\u2019t have the same consistency as lip balms, meaning salves won\u2019t offer lip protection.</p> \n<h2>How should businesses choose the perfect lip balm in 2024?</h2> \n<h3>1. Determine the type (or main ingredient)</h3> \n<p>Lip balmscome in various types, often determined by their main ingredient. Each type has pros and cons, making them viable options for consumers. Here\u2019s a look at a list of top options:</p> \n<h3>2. Check the sub-ingredients list</h3> \n<p>Although manufacturers can makelip balmscontaining only one ingredient, seeing more than one variety is common. In such cases, checking the ingredients list is necessary.</p> \n<p>Hence, it\u2019s crucial to note that some lip balms will dry the lips out because of their sub-ingredients.</p> \n<p>For example, phenol is a popular ingredient for treating cracked or chapped lips caused by bacterial infections. While it\u2019s incredibly effective, it can have negative effects if consumers apply it for long, making it a not-so-good option for lip balms.</p> \n<p>On the same note, camphor, salicylic acid, alum, and menthol are other ingredients found in some lip balms. They may get the job done (especially with their tingling sensation) but will show the lip\u2019s moisture if consumers apply it for extended periods.</p> \n<p>More importantly, consumers often consumethe balm\u2019singredients (not intentionally), so avoid anything potentially harmful to health. The ideal ingredient lists should have things like beeswax, apricot kernel oils, cocoa butter, etc.\u2014all-natural substances that won\u2019t do anything suspicious on the lips or when consumed. Some may even come with sweet almond oil and silk proteins to create a protective layer while giving the lips a silky gloss.</p> \n<h3>3. Focus on choosing balms for the appropriate skin type</h3> \n<p>Technically, the lip is part of the skin and should receive some TLC (tender love and care). For this reason, business buyers must also consider their target consumer\u2019s skin type to keep their lips healthy and hydrated without unnecessary side effects.</p> \n<p>Consumers with dry or chapped lips demandlip balmswith hydrating ingredients, like shea butter. Beeswax lip balms will also work only when combined with other nourishing ingredients.</p> \n<p>If targets have sensitive skin, they\u2019ll avoid lip balms with dyes or artificial fragrances\u2014all-natural is their love language.\u00a0 Somelip balmscan also help with sun protection, so business buyers must prioritize options with at least SPF 15 if consumers want that.</p> \n<h3>4. Consider the product\u2019s packaging</h3> \n<p>Why and how should consumers apply theirlip balm? This question will help businesses determine the best packaging for their target audience. If consumers prefer using their fingers to apply their balms, small containers will be the ideal way to attract them.</p> \n<p>Conversely, consumers who prefer pressing out their products will lean toward balm tubes. Lastly, if consumers love swiping a thick balm layer over their lips, they\u2019ll see sticks as an attractive option.</p> \n<h3>5. Prioritize lip balms offering extra benefits</h3> \n<p>Althoughlip balmsprimarily moisturize and hydrate the lips, there\u2019s no harm in offering variants with other benefits. Hence, businesses can opt for balms with nourishing ingredients that keep the lips hydrated and soft. Likewise, balms with minty flavors can double as a mouth freshener. While mostly colorless, lip balms can also have shades to give consumers a natural pinkish look.</p> \n<h2>In conclusion</h2> \n<p>Lip balms are one of the most popular beauty products on the market. They help hydratelipsin the terrible conditions of winter while keeping them soft and lush. They\u2019re also unsung summer heroes, with the inclusion of SPF ingredients. The stats on lip balms also speak volumes\u2014showing that they are undoubtedly one of the top beauty products to sell in 2024. This is backed up by the fact that 823,000 consumers searched for lip balms in January 2024 (according to Google data).</p> \n<p>Businesses can therefore use the tips discussed in this article to find the best products for their buyers and stand out in the lip balm market in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Understanding Gen Z: Beyond the surface</h2> \n<p>Generation Z, born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, is coming of age in a world that\u2019s more connected, socially aware, and technologically advanced than ever before. Their upbringing in this unique environment has cultivated a set of core values centered around authenticity, social responsibility, and inclusivity. Unlike their predecessors, Gen Z consumers are keenly aware of the global impact of their purchasing decisions, demanding transparency and ethical practices from beauty brands. This shift is prompting a reevaluation of what it means to be a beauty brand in the 21st century, with a focus on values that resonate with this influential consumer segment.</p> \n<h2>2. Sustainability: The non-negotiable trend</h2> \n<p>Sustainability has emerged as a non-negotiable demand among Gen Z consumers, who prioritize eco-friendly and ethically sourced products. This demographic is leading the charge in advocating for sustainable practices within the beauty industry, from reduced packaging waste to cruelty-free and vegan product lines. Beauty brands are responding by integrating sustainable practices into their operations, product development, and marketing strategies. The shift towards sustainability is not just a trend but a fundamental change in how beauty products are created, marketed, and consumed, reflecting Gen Z\u2019s deep-seated concerns for environmental conservation and ethical consumption.</p> \n<h2>3. Digital and technological integration in beauty</h2> \n<p>The digital realm is second nature to Gen Z, with technology playing a pivotal role in how they discover, evaluate, and purchase beauty products. This tech-savvy generation expects seamless online shopping experiences, personalized interactions, and innovative digital tools like augmented reality (AR) try-ons and AI-driven skincare consultations. Beauty brands are leveraging these technologies to create engaging and immersive experiences that cater to Gen Z\u2019s digital preferences. The integration of technology in beauty is transforming the consumer journey, making it more personalized, accessible, and interactive.</p> \n<h2>4. The rise of personalized beauty solutions</h2> \n<p>In a world where one-size-fits-all is no longer the norm, personalized beauty solutions are becoming increasingly popular among Gen Z consumers. This generation values individuality and seeks products that cater specifically to their unique needs and preferences. Advances in technology have made it possible for brands to offer customized skincare routines, makeup shades, and even fragrances, using online quizzes, AI, and machine learning to analyze individual customer data. These personalized offerings not only enhance the consumer experience but also foster a deeper connection between brands and their customers, leading to increased loyalty and satisfaction.</p> \n<h2>5. Wellness and beauty: A holistic approach</h2> \n<p>For Generation Z, beauty is not just skin deep; it encompasses a holistic approach that includes mental, physical, and emotional well-being. This generation\u2019s preference for wellness-centric beauty products\u2014those infused with natural ingredients, offering stress relief, or promoting a healthy lifestyle\u2014is reshaping the market.

The impact of social media on beauty standards</h2> \n<p>Social media platforms are a dominant influence in Gen Z\u2019s life, significantly impacting their perceptions of beauty standards. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become arenas where beauty trends are born and evolve. Gen Z uses these platforms not only for inspiration but also as a space for expressing individuality and challenging traditional beauty norms. Brands are taking note, of utilizing social media to engage with this demographic, showcase diverse beauty standards, and launch viral marketing campaigns. However, the rapid pace at which trends emerge and fade on social media requires brands to be agile and responsive to stay relevant in the ever-changing beauty landscape.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>As we look towards 2025, it\u2019s clear that Generation Z\u2019s preferences and values are playing a critical role in shaping the beauty industry\u2019s future. From the demand for personalized and wellness-centric beauty solutions to the influence of social media on beauty standards, brands must adapt to meet the evolving needs of this influential demographic. Embracing sustainability, leveraging digital innovations, and promoting inclusivity and diversity will be key for brands aiming to succeed in the coming years. As Gen Z continues to redefine beauty, the industry must listen and evolve to stay ahead in a competitive and rapidly changing market.</p> \n"}]}

Marketing experts say theglobal nail care marketwill reach US $32.84 billion by 2030 (a huge boost from its US $23.41 billion value in 2023) at a 4.95% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The offline segment leads the nail care market, as most consumers prefer the personalized experience popular with the distribution channel.

Cuticle pushers</h3> \n<p>Cuticles may be there to protect the nail from bacteria, but they are not exempt from nail care routines. In truth, proper nail maintenance (and repair) requires pushing back the cuticles with acuticle pusher\u2014it\u2019s why they\u2019re trending in 2024.</p> \n<p>Whilecuticle pushingmay sound unnecessary (after all, it\u2019s the body\u2019s natural nail protection), it offers some impressive nail care benefits. For starters, pushing back the cuticles makes the nails look longer. Consumers seeking nair repair may likely have overgrown cuticles, which give their nails short, unattractive appearances.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s more. Using acuticle pusherprepares the nails for pampering! The tool makes it easier to apply polishes and other nail-beautifying procedures. And as a bonus, it also keeps the cuticles healthy and strong enough to do their job.</p> \n<p>Cuticle pushers are starting 2024 strong by maintaining an impressive search interest. They\u2019ve got 22,200 searches in January 2024, increasing from 18,100 in the previous year.</p> \n<h3>2. Nail cutters</h3> \n<p>Pushing the cuticles may make the nails look longer, but all will be for naught if consumers don\u2019t groom them properly. Enternail cutters, the most popular way to keep nails trimmed and looking amazing.</p> \n<p>Even better,nail cuttersoffer a lot of variety, giving consumers different ways to cut their nails. Consumers can go with traditional nail cutters if they prefer the lever-like mechanism or opt for electric models for more convenience and efficiency.</p> \n<p>In addition,scissor nail cuttersare available for consumers with more nail grooming skills. These bad boys can handle intricate cutting and reach deep into annoying ingrown nails. Likewise, guillotine nail cutters offer an easy-cutting mechanism for the cleanest cuts possible.</p> \n<p>Nail cutters are a top-trending nail care tool. They\u2019re essential for nail maintenance and repair, so their growth and appeal are no surprise. They maintained an impressive 90,500 searches in January 2024, carrying it over from FY 2023 (based on Google data).</p> \n<h3>3. Cuticle clippers</h3> \n<p>While experts don\u2019t recommend cutting cuticles, they can get annoying sometimes, making it necessary to remove them. For instance, tough cuticles may refuse to budge from pushing, obstructing the polishing procedure.</p> \n<p>In such situations, experts reach forcuticle clippersto trim these tough cuticles, achieving similar results to using cuticle pushers. However, these tools can do more than trim cuticles; they can also help handle pesky hangnails.</p> \n<p>They also come in handy when regular nail clippers don\u2019t cut it, like when trimming thin fingernails and toenails in tight places.Cuticle clipperscan handle all these thanks to their small, stainless (or titanium) steel heads and easy-to-hold handles\u2014these also help increase their precision.</p> \n<p>Cuticle clippers have maintained steady search interest since 2023. According to Google data, they\u2019ve been getting 27,100 average monthly searches\u2014the same numbers as in January 2024. It may not have increased, but it\u2019s not going anywhere either.</p> \n<h3>4. Files and buffers</h3> \n<p>Nail filesand buffers look similar and serve similar purposes in nail care, leading many people to mistake one for the other. But the truth is, both tools are unique in their own right and shouldn\u2019t be used as substitutes for each other.</p> \n<p>Nail filesare the go-to for smoothing the edges of broken or jagged nails. However, how they handle this duty depends on their grit number (e.g., 180/180 or 100/180). Typically, a higher number indicates a softer file grit, while a lower one shows rougher variants.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,nail bufferssmooth the nail\u2019s surface to give it a glossy look without clear nail polishes. These products also use grit numbers to indicate how soft or coarse they are.</p> \n<p>Nail buffing blocksare among the most popular types because of their 3-dimensional nature. Since they\u2019re rectangular, buffing blocks host various textures on each side to provide the best smoothing experience for consumers.</p> \n<p>Google data shows both products are raking in impressive performance, although nail files are the more popular. While 90,500 consumers searched for nail files in January 2024, nail buffers attracted 40,500 searches.</p> \n<h3>5. Nail brushes</h3> \n<p>The hands are one of the busiest parts of the human body. While busy handling whatever task comes their way, the nails can accumulate dirt and bacteria that may be dangerous to their health. Luckily,nail brushescan help fix that.</p> \n<p>Nail brushesare necessary for any nail care routine. They have gentle bristles that easily reach into nails to remove dirt and germs. The benefits extend to the surrounding area, as nail brushes can help exfoliate dead skin cells to make hands and feet look and feel softer.</p> \n<p>According to Google data, up to 40,500 potential customers are searching for nail brushes in January 2024. They carried over these numbers from FY 2023, although interest grew mid-year with 2023\u2019s 33,100 searches.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>No matter how bad nails get, it\u2019s easy to nurse them back to health with a dedicated routine. While some consumers can easily book sessions from spas, others may do DIY nail restoration from the comfort of their homes\u2014but they\u2019ll need the right tools.</p> \n<p>Cuticle pushers can help consumers prepare their nails for self-pampering, while nail cutters will help trim them. Nail files and buffers will handle edge and surface smoothing, while nail brushes will help keep nails clean for longer. Cuticle clippers are for the professionals!</p> \n"}]}

This transformation reflects a broader change in consumer behavior and preferences, signaling a demand for products that not only enhance beauty but also contribute to overall well-being.

The role of aesthetics in modern lip care products5. Future directions: Sustainability and technology in lip care</p> \n<h2>1. The shift towards holistic lip care</h2> \n<p>The transition from conventional lipstick to holistic lip care is driven by a growing consumer awareness of health and wellness. Today\u2019s consumers are looking for products that do more than just provide color; they want lip care that offers hydration, nourishment, and protection against environmental factors. This trend is a response to the understanding that lip health is an integral part of skincare, with products enriched with vitamins, natural oils, and hydrating agents gaining popularity. Brands are responding by developing products that blend aesthetic benefits with practical, health-focused features, such as lip balms with SPF, overnight lip masks, and tinted lip oils that offer a subtle color while deeply moisturizing the lips.</p> \n<h2>2. Consumer demand for natural and sustainable products</h2> \n<p>Parallel to the rise of holistic lip care is the increasing demand for natural and sustainable products. Consumers are becoming more conscientious about the ingredients in their beauty products and their environmental impact. This shift has led to a surge in organic, vegan, and cruelty-free lip care options. Ingredient transparency is now a critical factor in the purchasing decision, with consumers favoring products free from parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. Additionally, eco-friendly packaging solutions, such as biodegradable tubes and refillable containers, are becoming more prevalent, reflecting a broader industry movement towards sustainability.</p> \n<h2>3. Innovation in lip care: Hydration, protection, and beyond</h2> \n<p>Innovation in lip care is not just about meeting the immediate needs of hydration and protection; it\u2019s also about anticipating future consumer desires. Advanced formulations that include SPF protection, anti-aging properties, and ingredients to combat environmental stressors are setting new standards in lip care. Products like lip serums and oils infused with antioxidants and natural botanicals offer targeted benefits, such as improving lip texture, reducing fine lines, and offering long-lasting hydration. Brands are leveraging scientific research to develop products that address specific lip care concerns, making lip care an integral part of the daily skincare routine.</p> \n<h2>4. The role of aesthetics in modern lip care products</h2> \n<p>The evolution of lip care is not solely focused on functionality and health benefits; aesthetic appeal remains a crucial aspect of product development. As consumers seek products that offer both practical and beauty benefits, brands are finding innovative ways to incorporate color and design into their lip care offerings. Tinted lip balms, for example, provide the hydration and nourishment needed while also offering a hint of color for those seeking a more natural makeup look. The packaging design is also evolving, with brands using visually appealing and distinctive designs to attract consumers. The aesthetic aspect extends to the sensory experience as well, with products offering a variety of textures and scents to enhance the user experience. This blend of beauty and wellness signifies a broader trend in the beauty industry, where the lines between skincare and makeup continue to blur.</p> \n<h2>5. Future directions: Sustainability and technology in lip care</h2> \n<p>As we look towards the future of lip care, two major trends emerge as driving forces: sustainability and technology. Sustainability is becoming a non-negotiable aspect of product development, with brands exploring innovative ways to reduce their environmental impact. This includes the use of sustainable ingredients, eco-friendly packaging, and zero-waste production methods. Technology, on the other hand, is playing a pivotal role in personalizing lip care. From AI-powered apps that analyze lip health and recommend products to advanced manufacturing techniques that allow for customized lip care solutions, technology is set to revolutionize how consumers approach lip care. Additionally, the integration of virtual try-on technology and augmented reality (AR) is enhancing the online shopping experience, allowing consumers to experiment with different lip care products virtually before making a purchase. These advancements not only cater to the growing demand for personalized and sustainable beauty solutions but also open up new possibilities for innovation within the lip care market.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The shift from lipstick to comprehensive lip care reflects a broader change in consumer priorities, emphasizing health, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal. This evolution is driven by a desire for products that offer more than just color, focusing instead on nourishment, protection, and environmental responsibility. As the beauty industry continues to innovate, the future of lip care looks promising, with advancements in technology and sustainability leading the way. Brands that can adapt to these changing consumer preferences, by offering products that meet the demands for both aesthetic appeal and health benefits, will likely lead the market in the years to come. The journey from lipstick to lip care is more than a trend; it\u2019s a reflection of the growing intersection between beauty, wellness, and sustainability.</p> \n"}]}

They keep in place whatever design consumers want on their nails, making them intrinsic to nail maintenance. It\u2019s no surprise then that most sellers are eager to know how to choose the ideal solution for their nails.</p> \n<p>This article will guide businesses through everything they need to consider when stocking up on nail glues in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow fast is the nail glue market growing?9 factors to consider when choosing nail gluesLast words</p> \n<h2>How fast is the nail glue market growing?</h2> \n<p>Research shows that thenail glue market sizewas USD1.15 billion in 2022, with experts predicting it will grow at a 7.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period (2023 to 2030).\u00a0 Nail glue is a popular product for consumers who love artificial nails over natural ones, which experts predict will propel market growth.</p> \n<p>Other significant drivers include the increasing awareness of nail care, availability of a wide variety, product convenience, and increase in at-home nail care. Solid-color nail glue emerged as the dominant segment in the global market.</p> \n<p>Regionally, North America is the largest nail glue market, with the U.S. being a significant contributor. Europe is the next biggest market because the United Kingdom, France, and Germany are major contributors.</p> \n<h2>9 factors to consider when choosing nail glues</h2> \n<h3>Glue type</h3> \n<p>Selecting theright glue typeis the most critical aspect of choosing nail glue. It determines how secure and long-lasting the bond will be for the art or artificial nails. Based on this, sellers can select three types with unique formulations and benefits.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a closer look at each of them:</p> \n<p>Cyanoacrylate is popular for its fast-bonding nature.\u00a0 This nail glue quickly creates a strong and durable bond, making it a popular choice for attaching artificial nails and art.</p> \n<p>Even better, \u2018super glue\u2019 is incredibly versatile, allowing consumers to use it for various nail applications. However, sellers must ensure they\u2019re getting formulas safe for artificial nails. That\u2019s the only way to guarantee the glue is compatible with the nail materials.</p> \n<p>Although it\u2019s a variation of super glue,ethyl cyanoacrylateoffers better flexibility. It\u2019s incredibly beneficial for artificial nails, as the bond won\u2019t become too rigid and risk damaging the nails.</p> \n<p>This glue is the best option for professionals in salon settings.Their formulasare strong and durable enough for various nail applications. However, using this glue requires skillful application due to its potent bonding capabilities\u2014a small mistake with methacrylate may require a lot of effort to fix.</p> \n<h3>Application method</h3> \n<p>In addition to choosing the right type ofnail glue, the application method also determines how precise and convenient using these products will be. However, nail glues can come with brush-on or nozzle applicators.</p> \n<p>Choosing betweenthese typesdepends on consumer preference. If they value precision and enjoy detailed nail art, brush-on applicators will be their preferred choice. Contrarily, nozzle applicators will help streamline the process if they prefer simplicity and efficiency.</p> \n<h3>Clear or colored</h3> \n<p>Another aspect businesses must decide is if their target consumers prefertheir glueclear or colored. It usually depends on the overall aesthetic consumers want and their personal preferences.</p> \n<p>Clear nail glueis incredibly versatile, making it an excellent choice for ladies who frequently change their nail colors. It blends seamlessly with any nail shade, allowing women to experiment with various hues\u2014no worries about affecting the overall look!</p> \n<p>Since clear glue dries transparent, it creates an almost invisible bond. For this reason, it\u2019s a great option for women who prefer a natural or minimalist appearance and want the focus to be on the nail art or design.</p> \n<p>Colored nail glue may be limited, but nonetheless can be found in various shades. This means buyers can choose colors to complement or match their artificial nails or natural nail beds.Colored gluesare the best bet for creating cohesive and polished looks, especially with transparent or sheer artificial nails.</p> \n<p>Another great thing about colored glue is how it conceals imperfections. It can hide gaps or mistakes between the natural and artificial nails, making the style look more seamless and flawless.</p> \n<h3>Odor</h3> \n<p>Unfortunately,nail gluescan emit a strong odor, which some people may find offensive. Some consumers may react terribly to these unpleasant smells, especially those with sensitive noses or allergy-prone systems.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, such consumers can explore low-odor formulations. Nail glues labeled \u201clow odor\u201d emit less pungent smells during application. So, they\u2019re the go-to for ladies sensitive to strong odors.These gluesalso appeal to consumers who want a more comfortable and pleasant experience with their artificial nails.</p> \n<p>But if consumers don\u2019t mind the smell, businesses can offer standard nail glues. Although they have a more pronounced odor, they\u2019re more effective and provide a stronger and more durable bond.</p> \n<h3>Water resistance</h3> \n<p>Will consumers engage in a lot of water-based activities? Then, they\u2019ll need water-resistant nail glues. Their formulas contain ingredients that prevent water from compromising the adhesive bond between the nail and the applied material.</p> \n<p>Additionally, water-resistantnail gluealso helps stop nail enhancements from lifting or loosening. So, consumers can wash their hands or do the dishes without worries.</p> \n<h3>Removability</h3> \n<p>How will consumers remove the nail glue? Different glues have varying removal processes, and understanding these options ensures sellers offer a hassle-free experience when ladies want to change or remove their manicures.</p> \n<p>Some nail glues require soaking, allowing consumers to enjoy a gentler removal process. These types become soft when women expose them to water, making the artificial nails easier to lift and remove without causing damage to the natural ones.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, othernail gluesmay require acetone or specific nail glue removers. Acetone can help break down strong bonds but may damage the natural nails and surrounding area. Thankfully, non-acetone removers are available to prevent such situations.</p> \n<h2>Last words</h2> \n<p>Nail glues are amazing products. They\u2019re the foundation for creating beautiful nail art. If the glue fails, the whole nail look will go down the drain.</p> \n<p>For this reason, businesses must carefully consider their options before selecting these products. Factor in the glue type, applicator, color, odor, water resistance, and removability, as they\u2019ll determine consumer\u2019s satisfaction with your offerings in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

However, the revenue forecast predicts the market will reach US $196.20 billion, growing at a 4.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>Experts also say the surging demand for face creams, body lotions, and sunscreens globally will impact market growth positively. In addition, the e-commerce sector will also be a major driving force over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Here are some other stats worth noting:</p> \n<h2>5 facial care products every woman needs in her beauty box</h2> \n<h3>1. Cleansers</h3> \n<p>Cleansersare specifically formulated face products that make the whole \u201cget glowing skin\u201d process easier. Consumers can use them to remove dead skin cells, makeup, and other impurities from the skin\u2019s surface, making them a must-have in any skincare routine.</p> \n<p>Thecleansermarket is packed with variety! There\u2019s one for every skin type and concern, so businesses can sift through the common ones below to determine the best ones for their target audience.</p> \n<p>According to Google Ads data, face cleansers have grown from their average 2023 searches to 2024 by 20%. They\u2019ve gone from 450,000 to 550,000 in January 2024!</p> \n<h3>2. Serums</h3> \n<p>After the cleanser, comes the serum. From reducing the appearance of dark spots to minimizing large pores,face serumsdo most of the heavy lifting in skin care routines.</p> \n<p>Face serumspack a punch with active ingredients like Vitamin C, glycolic acid, or hyaluronic acid, making them handy for combating specific skin concerns like dryness, acne, dullness, dark spots, and dryness.</p> \n<p>Since they\u2019re lighter than moisturizers, face serums are also perfect for layering. Manufacturers make them in various formulas, including oils, light creams, and gels\u2014some even have water-like consistencies.</p> \n<p>More importantly,serumsare an integral part of anti-aging skincare routines. They can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and tighten the skin to fight skin sagging. The best part is that consumers can expect results after a few weeks of routine usage.</p> \n<p>Serums have continued their impressive 2023 performance in 2024, showing they\u2019re sitting comfortably in the trending ranks. They\u2019ve started 2024 with 823,000 people searching for them.</p> \n<h3>3. Exfoliators</h3> \n<p>Consumers exfoliate to improve the appearance of their skin.Regular exfoliationfrees up clogged pores (and prevents pesky breakouts) and increases collagen production for a youthful glow. These are just a few reasons why consumers need exfoliators in their kits!</p> \n<p>However, exfoliators generally fall into two categories: physical and chemical.All exfoliatorsrequiring manual rubbing (and friction) fall under the physical category. Physical exfoliators are quite popular for their ease of access. Usually, they must follow up with serums to prevent irritation and moisture loss.</p> \n<p>Whilephysical exfoliationneeds mechanical devices (body brushes, motorized brushes, etc.) to remove dead skin cells, consumers can use scrubs with small particles to achieve the same effect. Such products can contain salt or sugar grains, crushed shells, or jojoba beads.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,chemical variantseliminate the scrubbing aspect of exfoliating. Instead, they combine chemicals (like hydroxy acids) with enzymes to offer more dramatic results. Typically, chemical exfoliators can contain alpha-hydroxy acids (like glycolic acids, lactic acid, and citric acid), beta-hydroxy acids (salicylic acid), and retinoids.</p> \n<p>Both chemical and physical exfoliants are performing excellently in 2024. While chemical exfoliators have raked in 246,000 searches, physical variants have attracted 301,000 in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>4. Moisturizers</h3> \n<p>The most basic (but trusted) facial care routine involves cleansers, exfoliators, andmoisturizers. These products help restore lost moisture and prevent the skin from feeling irritated after rinsing and scrubbing with other products.</p> \n<p>Moisturizersusually come in lotions, ointments, cream emulsions, or balms formulated with emollients that serve one purpose: keep the skin hydrated. These products easily seal the skin, locking in the moisture and nutrients from other products.</p> \n<p>These facial care products can also protect the skin from environmental irritants. While the primary use of moisturizers is to prevent and hydrate dry skin, they can be used a lot more routinely. For instance, they can help improve the skin barrier with continued use.</p> \n<p>In addition,moisturizerscan come with anti-aging ingredients to help minimize aging signs. They also help soothe sensitive skin and boost skin tone and texture while keeping it looking firm and healthier. The best part is that using moisturizers over a serum offers the best results.</p> \n<p>It seems more people are searching for moisturizers in 2024. Results from Google Ads show interest in these products reached 823,000 searches in January 2024\u2014a 20% boost from 2023\u2019s 673,000 average monthly searches.</p> \n<h3>5. Eye creams</h3> \n<p>Eye creamsare like moisturizers, but specifically for the eyes. They often come packed with skin-restoring and replenishing ingredients to help hydrate and reduce puffiness and dark circles. Eye creams also help protect the eye area from UV rays and other environmental aggressors.</p> \n<p>These products come with humectants, emollients, or a combination of both. Humectants (like bionic and hyaluronic acid) draw in water from deeper skin layers, while emollients (like glycerin) fill in cracks to make the skin smoother.</p> \n<p>Mosteye creamsalso offer anti-aging ingredients to combat crow\u2019s feet, wrinkles, and fine lines. Since manufacturers specifically formulate these products for the delicate area around the eye, they\u2019re usually thicker with more active ingredients than regular facial moisturizers.</p> \n<p>Eye creams have also carried over their impressive performance to 2024. These products have maintained their 165,000 monthly searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>Stock up now</h2> \n<p>The face is receiving much love this year as consumers are gearing up to look their best. The stats don\u2019t lie\u2014hundreds of thousands of potential customers are searching for the right products to start their 2024 skincare with a bang.</p> \n<p>Ready to enter the facial care market or stock up on depleted inventories? Focus on cleanses, serums, exfoliators, moisturizers, and eye creams to grab a share of the exploding consumer base in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Experts valuedthe marketat USD 11.03 billion in 2023, expecting it to reach USD 14.92 billion by 2030 at a 4.41% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The towel market\u2019s latest trends include sustainability, enhanced functionality, design simplicity, and personalization, catering to consumers\u2019 evolving preferences/ needs. Here are other stats to note:</p> \n<h2>What are the different types of face towels?</h2> \n<p>Spa face towelsare likely the most common items in a beauty salon. But what most people don\u2019t realize is that there are many types. In addition to the traditional variants most consumers are used to, disposable and compressed types are also available. Here\u2019s a closer look at each of them:</p> \n<h3>Traditional face towels</h3> \n<p>Also known as washcloths,spa face towelsare small fabric pieces designed for gentle exfoliation and cleansing. Manufacturers primarily make them from cotton, microfiber, or bamboo, but some variants come from other fabrics, like silk and muslin.</p> \n<p>Traditional spa face towelsoffer various sizes, textures, and colors, making it easy to pinpoint the right ones that match target consumers\u2019 preferences.</p> \n<h3>Compressed face towels</h3> \n<p>Compressed spa face towelsmake things even smaller than traditional variants. When compressed, these towels are easily the size of a small coin or large marble\u2014an eighty to ninety percent volume reduction from regular spa face towels.</p> \n<p>So, how can consumers use these towels if they\u2019re so small? It\u2019s simple:compressed face towelsare highly absorbent. For this reason, they\u2019ll expand to full-sized face towels when soaked in water. While they compress back when dry, consumers can also dispose of them.</p> \n<p>Although they\u2019re an easy and quick way to remove makeup and clean the face,they\u2019renot as comfortable as regular towels. Regardless, manufacturers make them from the same materials as regular face towels.</p> \n<h3>Disposable face towels</h3> \n<p>All compressed face towels are disposable, but not alldisposable face towelsare compressed. These towels are the lightest and thinnest options, making them useful for daily face wiping, asides from the spa. They\u2019re also single-use and easy to dispose\u2014as their name implies.</p> \n<p>While they\u2019re less convenient than their compressed cousins, they\u2019re more comfortable and cost-effective. More importantly,disposable face towelscome pre-moistened with mild surfactants, glycerin, micellar water, and aloe vera.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers also make them from soft,non-woven materials, like cotton or polyester. And they\u2019re gentle enough for daily face cleaning on all skin types.</p> \n<h2>Everything sellers should know before selecting face towels</h2> \n<h3>Face towel material</h3> \n<p>Face towels offer even more variety when it comes to their material. Manufacturers make these essentials from various materials to provide different benefits and cater to wide preferences. Here\u2019s a table showing different face towel materials and what they offer.</p> \n<h3>Softness and absorbency</h3> \n<p>Softness and absorbency are critical factors. Businesses must not ignore any of them when choosing face towels. While absorbency determines towel effectiveness, softness shows how comfortable they\u2019ll be in the long run.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, some face towels lose softness and absorbency after multiple use. In addition to prioritizing high-quality materials, consider the following factors when choosing face towels to sell:</p> \n<p>Here are more details on the materials listed above:</p> \n<h3>Strength and durability</h3> \n<p>While softness/absorbency are undeniably important, strength and durability determine how long the towels will last. Each material offers something different in strength and durability, but how long they last depends on how consumers use them.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the different strengths and durability of each material listed above.</p> \n<h3>Drying time and shrinkage</h3> \n<p>Face towels with longer drying times won\u2019t be sufficient for daily use, so consumers may have to purchase multiple. But to avoid the unnecessary expense, they\u2019d rather go for towels that dry quickly.</p> \n<p>In addition, poor-quality face towels may shrink from the first to fifth use. So sellers must always prioritize high-quality products to avoid this issue.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Consumers need face towels for various reasons other than drying their faces. Face towels are great gentle exfoliators to help remove dead skin cells. Massaging with face towels can also help improve blood circulation and enhance skincare product absorption (like cleansers, serums, and moisturizers).</p> \n<p>However, it\u2019s not as simple as stocking up on any face towels sellers see on marketplaces. They must consider materials, softness/absorbency, strength/durability, and drying time/shrinkage before buying and selling face towels in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Thankfully, they havesolid brush cleansersas an alternative.</p> \n<p>Solid makeup brushcleaners offer an easier and more effective way to target those pesky bacteria. Typically, manufacturers make them from soap blocks or wax before infusing them with antibacterial agents.</p> \n<p>But how aresolid brush cleanersmore convenient than their liquid counterparts? Consumers also need to wet their brushes and swirl them around the soap or wax until they\u2019re clean\u2014no need for any massaging action.</p> \n<p>These brush cleaners are also incredibly portable, offering a quick and easy way to clean makeup brushes on the go. However, they\u2019re more expensive than liquid brush cleaners.</p> \n<h3>Brush cleaning mats</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, makeup brushes need a deeper clean than what liquid or solid cleaners can offer. For example, having foundation dry on brushes can be a thorn in the ass for consumers trying to wash them out. That\u2019s wherebrush cleaning matscome in.</p> \n<p>These products offer an impressive way to clean tough and stubborn makeup from brushes in record time.Brush cleaning matsoften come with various grooves, ridges, and patterns to make the cleaning process hassle-free.</p> \n<p>Consumers only need to swirl their makeup brushes on the mat (like on solid cleaners) to reach deep into the makeup\u2019s bristles.

These tools can clean and dry makeup brushes in less than a minute!

Luckily, mostelectric brush cleanerscome with multiple collars, boasting up to 95% compatibility with all brushes on the market.</p> \n<h3>Natural brush cleaners</h3> \n<p>The go-green trend extends its influence to various markets, and brush cleaners are not exempt.Natural brush cleanersare eco-friendly alternatives to soaps and liquid cleaners, usually involving ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, or Castile soap.</p> \n<p>Natural brush cleanersalso involve mixing these ingredients to achieve the perfect cleaner. They give consumers more DIY power to choose the solution they want. Here are some popular combos:</p> \n<h2>Things to consider when choosing makeup brush cleaners in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s easy for things to go wrong with makeup brush cleaners. Consumers may reduce their brush\u2019s lifespan or see their bristles falling out and panic. That\u2019s why businesses must prioritize cleaners with gentle and effective ingredients.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s best to avoid cleaners with harsh chemicals as they can wreak havoc on brush bristles over time. Instead, look for mild surfactants, plant-based extracts, and conditioning agents. They\u2019re excellent choices for removing makeup residues and maintaining brush softness and suppleness.</p> \n<h3>Brush bristle type</h3> \n<p>Businesses must also consider the brush bristle type they\u2019re targeting. Usually, bristles can either be natural or synthetic, each requiring different formulas for maximum effectiveness.</p> \n<p>Natural bristles, often sourced from animal hair, will benefit from cleaners with conditioning agents to keep them soft and prevent them from becoming brittle.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not the same for their synthetic variants. These bristles come from man-made materials, so they\u2019ll respond well to formulas designed to remove product buildup without compromising their structure.</p> \n<h3>Antibacterial properties</h3> \n<p>One of the main reasons women get makeup brush cleaners is to eliminate anything that would irritate their skin or cause unwanted breakouts. Unfortunately, makeup brush cleaners can\u2019t do that if they don\u2019t have antibacterial properties.</p> \n<p>For this reason, businesses must look for options with antibacterial or antimicrobial properties to safeguard the user\u2019s skin. These antibacterial or antimicrobial components will eliminate any stubborn bacteria, preventing any skin issues, breakouts, or other dermatological concerns.</p> \n<p>Moreover, these antibacterial/antimicrobial properties also help extend brush lifespan. They\u2019ll stop harmful microbes from compromising brush bristles, safeguarding the makeup brush\u2019s performance.</p> \n<h3>Scent</h3> \n<p>In addition to the makeup brush cleaner\u2019s cleaning properties, businesses must also watch out for its scent. Remember that everyone reacts differently to aromas, and makeup brush cleaners are not exempt. However, choosing scented cleaners or not depends on preference.</p> \n<p>Some consumers prefer neutral and fragrance-free makeup brush cleaners. They\u2019re particularly appealing to consumers with sensitive noses or skin, as they cut down the risks of potential allergic reactions or skin irritations certain scents can trigger.</p> \n<p>Contrarily, other consumers may appreciate a touch of fragrance. So, retailers can opt for a cleaner infused with light, pleasant scents, adding a subtle, enjoyable aroma to the brush-cleaning process. These fragrances can range from floral and citrus notes to more nuanced and neutral undertones.</p> \n<h3>Residue-free</h3> \n<p>Would the cleaner leave brushes residue-free? That\u2019s the big question that determines whether consumers will purchase these products or not. Residues from low-quality cleaners can cause undesirable effects, especially with makeup application and skin health.</p> \n<p>Always prioritize residue-free, high-quality brush cleaners to keep everything smooth and safe for consumers. Makeup brush removers should effectively remove all traces of makeup, oils, and impurities from bristles, not add more problems.</p> \n<h2>The bottom line</h2> \n<p>The makeup application process is not complete without cleaning the brushes. Previously, it was a tricky, time-consuming task that depended on the type of makeup products. But now, makeup brush cleaners can handle everything from oily cosmetics to water-based products.</p> \n<p>Businesses can invest in liquid or solid brush cleaners for consumers who prefer conventional methods. Or, they can stock electric cleaners and brush cleaning mats for ladies who prioritize time and convenience. Natural makeup brush cleaners, on the other hand, are for eco-friendly buyers.</p> \n<p>But before choosing any of these cleaners, remember to consider their ingredients, bristle compatibility, scent, residue-free nature, and antibacterial properties.</p> \n"}]}

They may also want to add volume or shiny hair to their natural hair. Since not everyone wants to rock a full wig, hair extensions have become the next viable option.</p> \n<p>But a quick look into the hair extension market will see sellers confronted with terms like clip-ins, micro-links, tape-ins, pre-bonded, etc. No doubt, these terms may seem intimidating, but they\u2019re simply the kinds of extensions businesses can add to their hair stores.</p> \n<p>This article will break down the different artificial hair extension types to give businesses a better understanding of what they should purchase in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow big is the artificial hair extension market?Artificial hair extensions: 5 types consumers are looking at in 2024Wrapping up</p> \n<h2>How big is the artificial hair extension market?</h2> \n<p>Experts say thehair extension marketwill surge to US $12.27 billion (from US $6.83 billion in 2023), registering an 8.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2030. Consumers now see hair extensions as a major way to foster self-confidence, which experts expect will be a huge driving force for the market.</p> \n<p>Here are other statistics from marketing experts:</p> \n<h2>Artificial hair extensions: 5 types consumers are looking at in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Clip-in hair extensions</h3> \n<p>Also known asclip-in wefts, these extensions are strands of contoured pieces attached to a base with silicone or fabric. Then, manufacturers attach clips to their bases to make them ready to use on the go.</p> \n<p>All women must do is clip their preferred pieces to their natural hair. The best part is that each clip snaps open and closes easily, so using these extensions is a mostly hassle-free process.</p> \n<p>More importantly, these hair extensions are the best options for women looking for the least permanent styles. They can remove and add them quickly and easily, with most processes taking 5 to 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Since they don\u2019t involve chemicals, heat pressure, or other installation methods,clip-in hair extensionscause zero damage to the natural types. That is why they\u2019re the most popular hair extensions, with over 90,500 searches in January 2024 (based on Google data).</p> \n<p>Even better,clip-in hair extensionsdon\u2019t require a lot of maintenance. Consumers only need to wash them every 15 to 20 wears, and they\u2019ll be good as new. With regular wear and proper care, they can last up to six months, sometimes even a year.</p> \n<h3>2. Sew-in hair extensions</h3> \n<p>In contrast to clip-ins,sew-ins(or weaves) need the help of an expert hairdresser\u2014consumers simply can\u2019t use them on their own. Consumers typically weave their natural hair into cornrows, then sew these braids to their hair\u2014with the help of a thread and needle.</p> \n<p>Sew-in hair extensionsare more common among consumers with thicker hair because of their application process. Generally, applying weaves is a tedious process, usually taking several hours. They also heavily strain the scalp, making weaves incompatible with thin or lighter hair.</p> \n<p>Consumers can also get weaves in wig form. Despite coming in one piece instead of wefts, these wig-form sew-ins still attach to the cornrows similarly.</p> \n<p>Sew-in hair extensionsare popular (90,500 searches in January 2024, according to Google data) because of their seamless look and permanence. Hairdressers sew these extensions into the natural hair so that they can\u2019t come off and offer the most natural look.</p> \n<h3>3. Microlink hair extensions</h3> \n<p>Here\u2019s another extension that requires the help of professionals: microlink hairs (18,100 Google searches in January 2024). These extensions usesilicone-lined beadsto attach tiny hair wefts to small natural hair sections.</p> \n<p>Then, hairdressers will use a special tool to secure the beads to the hair and tighten them to keep it steady. Whilemicrolink hair extensionsdon\u2019t need glue or heat, they can damage the hair if consumers don\u2019t install them correctly.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the scary drawbacks,microlink hair extensionshave their benefits. For starters, women can wash them like they do their natural hair and style them with their regular products. These extensions are also semi-permanent, lasting up to 4 months without looking worn out.</p> \n<h3>4. Tape-in hair extensions</h3> \n<p>The name gives away how these extensions work. Usually, manufacturers pre-tape these extensions so consumers can attach them to either side of their natural hair.</p> \n<p>They also require professional assistance to align them properly with the natural hair\u2019s roots. But here\u2019s the catch:tape-in hair extensionsrequire a heated tool to apply the glue, which may damage the consumer\u2019s hair.</p> \n<p>Consumers withtape-insmust also consider the kind of hair products or conditioners they use. Generally, experts recommend avoiding products that may loosen the tape and make it slip off\u2014a very common issue with these extensions.</p> \n<p>However, when done right, tape-in hair extensions can provide a natural-looking hair job for up to 8 weeks, after which consumers must remove and reapply. Tape-ins are also fairly popular, with 49,500 searches in January 2024 (based on Google data).</p> \n<h3>5. Wigs & hair pieces</h3> \n<p>These hair extensions are the most variety-packed. They come in different forms, allowing women to topically wear whatever style and color they prefer. Although often bundled together, wigs and hair pieces are two different products.</p> \n<p>Consumers usewigsto cover their entire heads as a replacement for their natural hair. Wigs are great for many reasons, including offering solutions for hair loss, balding, or wanting to change looks without commitment.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,hair piecesoften come in ponytails, hair ties, or buns that ladies can place on top of their natural hair. They\u2019re perfect for use in thinning areas or when women need more volume on a specific section. That\u2019s not all. Hair pieces can also help create different hairstyles, like full, long ponytails.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Hair extensions are a great way for women to swap hairstyles or gain confidence boosts. They come in different forms, from the easiest ones to apply (clip-ins) to the variants not recommended by stylists (fusion extensions).</p> \n<p>Regardless of which one consumers prefer, they must choose between human and synthetic hair. So, if consumers prefer a natural style and want to treat their artificial hair the same way they would their natural hair, sellers must stock human hair extensions.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if women can\u2019t handle the hassle of human hair and would prefer a more affordable way to change hairstyles, retailers can offer synthetic extensions. Thankfully, each extension type listed here has human and synthetic variants, so buy them according to consumers\u2019 needs in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

This inclusive approach is expected to set a new standard in the industry.</p> \n<h2>The role of alt-actives in future formulations</h2> \n<p>As regulations tighten and consumer skepticism grows, the focus is shifting towards alt-actives like salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and probiotics.</p> \n<p>These ingredients offer a gentler approach to dandruff care, promising efficacy without compromising hair health. The future of dandruff care formulations lies in the balance of these actives with soothing and hydrating agents, ensuring products not only treat dandruff but also nourish the scalp and hair.</p> \n<h2>Crafting the future: Action points for brands</h2> \n<p>To stay competitive, brands must prioritize trust and efficacy. This includes investing in clinical trials, educating consumers on ingredients, and exploring new product formats beyond traditional shampoos and conditioners.</p> \n<p>Future dandruff care will likely see an expansion into serums, masks, and treatments specifically designed for various scalp conditions and hair types, underlining the industry\u2019s shift towards comprehensive, health-focused hair care.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, the next generation of dandruff care promises to be more inclusive, effective, and personalized than ever before. With a focus on destigmatizing scalp conditions, catering to individual needs, and harnessing the power of alt-actives, the future looks bright for those seeking solutions to this ubiquitous concern. Brands that adapt to these trends and prioritize the health and diversity of consumer needs will lead the charge in revolutionizing dandruff care by 2025.</p> \n"}]}

It created a high disdain for wigs made from them, so most female consumers preferred purchasing human hair despite its high cost.</p> \n<p>But synthetic hair has gotten a much-needed upgrade, with modern ones nearly indistinguishable from human hair. Although cheap ones still roam the market, more people now accept synthetic hair as a more affordable alternative.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a guide that explains the differences between human and synthetic hair and how to stock up on synthetic hair wigs.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsSynthetic vs. human hair: What are the differences?What consumers look for when searching for synthetic hair wigsRounding up</p> \n<h2>Synthetic vs. human hair: What are the differences?</h2> \n<p>When consumers want wigs or hairpieces, they must choose between synthetic and human hair. But what differences make a person prefer one over the other?</p> \n<p>For starters, human-hair wigs are popular for having a very realistic look. They also last longer than their synthetic counterparts, as long as consumers care for them. But there\u2019s a catch: they\u2019re so lifelike that consumers must care for them like they do their regular hair\u2014that means regular grooming and styling before use.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,synthetic hairhas gotten a better reputation over the years. The \u201crealistic look\u201d argument is no longer a deal-breaker, as the highest-quality wigs don\u2019t fall short compared to their human counterparts.</p> \n<p>Althoughsynthetic hairlasts longer than its previous iterations, it still needs replacement after three to four months of use. Regardless, they remain more accessible than human hair.</p> \n<p>Another big advantage of synthetic hairpieces is their affordability. Since synthetic hair wigs are not as expensive as their human counterparts, they are great for beginners. They can also try different styles before pouring more money into expensive variants.</p> \n<h2>What consumers look for when searching for synthetic hair wigs</h2> \n<h3>Hairpiece type</h3> \n<p>Some consumers see wigs as fun accessories, while others need them to rebuild confidence. Whatever the reasons are, consumers first determine the kind of wig they\u2019ll require before going over other details.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the different hairpieces that can usesynthetic hairand the types of consumers that use them.</p> \n<p>Hair toppersare popular for covering areas with less hair, typically at the top of the head. These wiglets are perfect for disguising thinning and part widening, which can be embarrassing for some consumers.</p> \n<p>Usually, consumers can wear them with clips. But sellers can also offer hypoallergenic tapes to those without enough hair to support those clips. The best part is that synthetic hair toppers don\u2019t need a lot of styling and maintenance.</p> \n<p>Synthetic full-cap wigs are like saviors for ladies with complete or partial hair loss caused by cancer treatments or more severe alopecia.</p> \n<p>Even better,synthetic full wigsare always ready to wear, so women may not need to style them frequently. In addition to being popular among cancer and hair loss patients, full wigs are perfect for consumers seeking hassle-free hairstyle changes.</p> \n<p>Women also turn to clip-in hair extensions ortemporary hair piecesif they\u2019re looking for partial coverage or want to handle a specific hair loss area. These pieces offer enough coverage and can serve as hair lengtheners, too.</p> \n<p>In addition, these hairpieces can come in different styles. They\u2019re available in buns, fringes, ponytails, and \u00be pieces that easily clip into natural hair.</p> \n<p>Men also suffer from severe hair loss, so they may come looking for somesynthetic hair wigs. In that case, they\u2019ll see hair pieces with full scalp coverage as the best option.</p> \n<p>Usually, men go for wigs that look virtually undetectable. Men also love options that feel super snug and can be cut at the barber\u2019s shop for the perfect fit.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, they may only use hair systems to cover some top thinning. These wigs disguise the top of the head while blending into natural hair on the sides and back.</p> \n<h3>Cap construction</h3> \n<p>Synthetic wigs(for men or women) come with caps that help secure the hair to the wearer\u2019s head. However, the cap type determines how comfortable, expensive, and natural the wig will look.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the options available and why consumers may choose them.</p> \n<h3>Wig style and texture</h3> \n<p>Once consumers decide on their preferred wig and cap construction, they\u2019ll consider style next. One important factor in determining the styles consumers want is face shape.</p> \n<p>Different face shapes requiredifferent wig styles, ranging from short to long and bobs to wavy. With that in mind, here\u2019s a table showing the styles for the five most common face shapes.</p> \n<p>Note: These styles mostly apply to full wigs. Other wig types depend more on color, texture, and size for the perfect fit.</p> \n<p>Consumers also choose their preferred wig texture while selecting a compatible style for their face. Texture refers to the wig\u2019s hair pattern, and buyers may choose from the three types below:</p> \n<p>Straight and wavy textures are highly recommended for consumers purchasing their first wigs. They don\u2019t require as much maintenance as curly textures. While curly wigs look jaw-dropping, failing to maintain them will damage their looks.</p> \n<h3>Wig size</h3> \n<p>Although 95% of consumers can use average-sized wigs, these hair accessories can also come in large and petite sizes.Many wigseven come with adjustable straps to help get a more comfortable and secure fit, but that may not suffice for some consumers.</p> \n<p>The good news is that most consumers already have their measurements ready. Here are the three measurement categories they base their search on:</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Consumers get wigs for different reasons. While some use them to try various styles, others need them to combat serious issues like hair loss.</p> \n<p>For this reason, manufacturers pump the market with various types, styles, and sizes to offer something for everyone. More importantly, synthetic hair is becoming more popular as recent technologies ensure quality ones look as real as human hair.</p> \n<p>So, there is no need to worry about synthetic hair\u2019s bad reputation. They\u2019re quickly becoming profitable investments in 2024, making now the best time to enter the market.</p> \n"}]}

Developing the perfect mascara involves understanding not just the desired effect\u2014be it volume, length, curling, or definition\u2014but also the intricacies of brush types and formulas. This guide explores the journey of creating a mascara that not only enhances the beauty of the eyes but also meets the specific needs of your target audience.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsDeciding on the desired lash effectUnderstanding the importance of the right wandExploring brush types for every lookChoosing the right formula for your mascara</p> \n<h2>Deciding on the desired lash effect</h2> \n<p>The first step in developing the perfect mascara is determining the effect you aim to achieve. Whether you\u2019re targeting volume, length, curling, or definition, this decision will guide the selection of the wand and formula. Understanding your target market\u2019s preferences is crucial in this stage, as it sets the foundation for the product\u2019s development. Each effect\u2014volume, length, curling, or definition\u2014serves a unique purpose and appeals to different consumer desires. A mascara intended to volumize lashes will require a different approach in both wand design and formula than one designed for lengthening.</p> \n<h2>Understanding the importance of the right wand</h2> \n<p>The wand is a critical component of mascara, directly influencing the application and the final look. Its shape, size, and material can dramatically affect how the mascara performs on lashes. Selecting the right wand is pivotal to achieving the desired lash effect.</p> \n<p>The wand\u2019s design, from its curvature to the spacing and flexibility of its bristles, plays a significant role in the mascara\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises. The right wand not only facilitates ease of application but also enhances the mascara\u2019s performance, ensuring that each lash is coated evenly for a flawless finish.</p> \n<h2>Exploring brushtypes for every look</h2> \n<p>There are several brush types, each suited to different looks and effects:</p> \n<p>Traditional Brush: Ideal for achieving curled lashes with volume. The design of the traditional brush is such that it maximizes lash coverage, allowing for a generous application of the formula that results in full-bodied lashes.</p> \n<p>Hourglass-shaped Brush: Perfect for a wide-eyed look, offering clump-free volume from root to tip. The unique shape of this brush ensures that each lash, from the inner to the outer corner, receives an even coat of mascara, thereby enhancing the eyes\u2019 natural shape.</p> \n<p>Skinny Brush: Best for separate, defined lashes, especially for those with shorter lashes. This brush type excels at reaching the base of each lash, elongating them without the risk of clumps, making it ideal for a more natural, refined look.</p> \n<p>Plastic Bristle Brush: Provides flexibility, ensuring a clump-free, even application across all lashes. Its design is particularly suited for separating lashes while providing a uniform coat of mascara, resulting in a defined, voluminous look.</p> \n<p>Each brush type offers distinct advantages and is chosen based on the mascara\u2019s intended effect. Understanding the unique benefits of each brush type allows developers to tailor their product to meet specific beauty goals.</p> \n<h2>Choosing the right formula for your mascara</h2> \n<p>After selecting the perfect wand, the next critical step in mascara development is choosing the right formula. The formula not only affects the mascara\u2019s performance in terms of longevity and appearance but also plays a significant role in lash health and ease of use. Whether you opt for a waterproof or regular formula depends on the needs of your target audience and the desired effect of the mascara.</p> \n<p>Waterproof Mascara: Known for its durability, waterproof mascara is an excellent choice for long-lasting wear. Ideal for individuals with active lifestyles or those prone to watery eyes, its thicker formula ensures that the mascara stays put throughout the day, without smudging or flaking.</p> \n<p>Additionally, waterproof mascara can better hold a curl, providing an uplifted look for longer periods. However, the downside is its removal process; waterproof mascara requires an oil-based makeup remover, as it can be challenging to take off, potentially leading to lash breakage if not removed gently and thoroughly.</p> \n<p>Regular Mascara: Offering a more natural look, regular mascara is suited for daily wear. Its lighter, more flexible formula makes it easier to apply and remove, posing less risk of lash damage.</p> \n<p>Regular mascara is typically less drying than its waterproof counterpart, making it a healthier option for everyday use. For those seeking a compromise between durability and gentleness, smudge-proof regular mascaras provide a middle ground, resisting smudging without the harshness of waterproof formulas.</p> \n"}]}

According to experts, theglobal skincare marketclosed 2023 with an astounding USD 142.14 billion value. Even better, they predict revenue will shoot to USD 196.20 billion by FY 2030 at a 4.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>What\u2019s the reason for the skincare product market\u2019s impressive growth? The influence of social media (especially famous content creators) and the rising popularity of organic skincare are the major factors propelling the market to new heights.</p> \n<p>Here are other important highlights:</p> \n<h2>Skincare sets: 5 trendy products to boost their value in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Face oils</h3> \n<p>Face oilshave been around for centuries. They\u2019ve been the go-to product for hydrating hair and skin for a long time. But the good news is that these products haven\u2019t lost their spark. In modern times, face oils are still amazing options for locking moisture but now offer added benefits.</p> \n<p>Modernface oilsare incredible multitaskers! In addition to creating a protection layer to trap moisture, they can help handle other skin concerns. Here\u2019s a summary of what these amazing products can do:</p> \n<p>Whileface oilsdefinitely offer these benefits, different types may come with various qualities. The various types include argan, tea tree, jojoba, rosehip, marula, and coconut oil.</p> \n<p>Face oils have already shown impressive growth in 2024. Search interest grew by 20%, from 74,000 in 2023 to 90,500 in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Masks</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, pampering the skin needs a little more than oils. When consumers want to target specific skincare concerns,face masksare one of their best options. It\u2019s why these products are great additions to any skincare routine.</p> \n<p>Face maskscover the skin, infusing ingredients that improve its appearance and quality. However, the effects depend on the ingredients manufacturers pack in them. For instance, clay masks can help tighten and smoothen the skin, while those containing hyaluronic acid will attract and lock moisture.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Gel face masks may contain polyhydroxy acid, antioxidants, and marine extracts to boost skin recovery and rehydrate.Exfoliating maskshave hydroxy acids as primary ingredients to help remove dead skin cells and clean pores.</p> \n<p>Whatever consumers want to address, a mask with the right ingredients awaits them. Face masks are also incredibly popular. They attracted 673,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Toner</h3> \n<p>Tonerscan work wonders on a consumer\u2019s skin during beauty routines. These water-based liquids often feature skin-soothing ingredients, like eucalyptus, aloe, and peppermint. Toners have one responsibility: gently refreshing the skin without robbing it of its natural moisture.</p> \n<p>These productscome next after consumers use cleansers. Why? Because they\u2019ll help eliminate any last traces of grime, dirt, and other impurities stuck in the pores after a good wash.</p> \n<p>However, the main benefits show when consumers use them routinely and regularly.Tonerscan influence the appearance and tightness of pores, helping ladies combat the notorious aging skin. They can also restore skin pH levels, improve tone, and refine rough patches.</p> \n<p>Another great thing abouttonersis that anyone can use them! Regardless, they\u2019re more beneficial for ladies with oily/acne-prone skin or makeup\u2014toners will help clean those annoying clogged pores.</p> \n<p>Toners are also impressive search-wise. Google data shows that these products carried over their exceptional performance from 2023, starting 2024 with 550,000 searches!</p> \n<h3>Serum</h3> \n<p>Although some brands market face oils asserums, they are not the same product. In truth, serums are the answer for consumers looking to upgrade their skincare regimen with products offering bigger doses of active ingredients.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers make these products to nourish, hydrate, and protect the skin. So,serumsare the next products consumers need after cleansing and before moisturizing.</p> \n<p>Consumers can\u2019t use moisturizers or face oils instead of serums because of their light formulations. Serums have thinner viscosity, meaning they\u2019ll absorb into the skin faster than other products.</p> \n<p>In addition,serumsare popular for consumers with acne-prone or oily skin types. However, other formulas target different skin types, like water-based serums for dry skin.\u00a0 Serums may also contain ingredients like retinol to improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines.</p> \n<p>Serums are packing all the attention this year! Google data shows they entered January 2024 with 823,000 searches, growing from 673,000 in 2023.</p> \n<h3>Chemical peel</h3> \n<p>These products are like more intense exfoliants that deliver near-instantaneous results. But since they use chemicals to exfoliate the face, experts recommend sticking tochemical peelswith a 2.0 pH for maximum effect without causing consumers discomfort.</p> \n<p>That aside,chemical peelsoffer various benefits in a skincare routine. These include:</p> \n<p>Chemical peelsalso offer different strengths. Businesses can provide superficial peels for gentle exfoliation and mild skin problems, medium for moderate skin concerns (like wrinkles, fine lines, and scarring), and deep peels for targeting damaged skin cells.</p> \n<p>Based on Google data, chemical peels have witnessed some growth this year. Their interest increased from 201,000 searches in 2023 to 246,000 in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>The bottom line</h2> \n<p>Most women can\u2019t get a smooth, blemish-free face without putting in the work. Some prefer going for sets to reduce the hassle of buying each product separately. So, it\u2019s up to businesses to elevate their offers with amazing products that will attract consumers on the spot.</p> \n<p>In addition to the standard cleanser, exfoliant, and moisturizer, sellers can add toners, face oils, masks, chemical peels, and serums to skincare sets. Each product listed here has a huge audience searching for them, so including them will boost desirability in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Whether consumers want at-home manicures or salons want to restock, there\u2019s never a shortage of options!</p> \n<p>Besides traditional formulas that have existed since millennials were kids, many types have popped up to offer new and exciting ways to apply beautiful nail art. These days, shelves can be stocked with nail polish, and each one offers something different (especially color-wise).</p> \n<p>The nail polish market is undoubtedly profitable but could easily be a miss if sellers don\u2019t know what to get. Consider this a guide to the top-trending polish types in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsA summary of the nail polish market5 nail polish trends to offer in 2024In closing</p> \n<h2>A summary of the nail polish market</h2> \n<p>2023 was a huge year for theglobal nail polish marketas more people gained interest in nail art and care routines. Experts valued the market at US $16.23 billion in 2023\u2014but that\u2019s not the most impressive part.</p> \n<p>Thenail polish markethas already grown to US $17.30 billion in 2024, with experts predicting it will hit over US $25.82 billion by 2030 at a 6.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). In addition to the rising interest in nail air and care products, the advent of nail polish with natural ingredients is also boosting demand.</p> \n<p>Check out these other important stats:</p> \n<h2>5 nail polish trends to offer in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Traditional nail polish</h3> \n<p>These nail polishesmay be the most basic, but they\u2019re like the mascots for these products\u2014everyone brings up images of them when thinking about nail polish! Traditional nail polishes are the kinds people see drying in warm air dryers.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers make these polishes in various finishes, from shimmery to matte and shiny\u2014they have it all. And these polishes don\u2019t nail lamps to cure after application\u2014just wear, dry, and go.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s a catch:traditional nail polishesare not the most durable options. Yes, they\u2019re easy to use (and reapply), but consumers can only expect them to last for a week maximum before chipping. Regardless, they don\u2019t need any expertise, making traditional nail polishes the best choice for trying different colors.</p> \n<p>Traditional nail polishesmay not be the most popular anymore, but they still have a massive audience, earning them the \u201ctrending\u201d status. Based on Google data, these products raked in 450,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>2. Acrylic nail polish</h3> \n<p>Humans love when something feels different from the norm, and that saying couldn\u2019t be more true foracrylic nail polishes. These are not the regular polish-in-a-bottle types. Instead, acrylic comes in a powder form.</p> \n<p>But wait, how does it coat the nails? Consumers must mix the powder with monomer to make it a gummy liquid. Here\u2019s the best part: whenacrylic dries, it becomes one of the most durable polishes known to man.</p> \n<p>Aesthetics are not the only benefit of these polish types. Ladies often use them to strengthen their natural nails. Some even add acrylic to the tips of their nails to increase their length.</p> \n<p>While it seems consumers have no control over the shape, they can easily file it down to their preference\u2014like regular nails!Acrylic nailscan last consumers up to three weeks. Ladies can also file them once or twice before needing a new set.</p> \n<p>Do acrylic nails seem stressful? According to Google Ads, many people don\u2019t seem to mind. 673,000 people searched for acrylic nails in January 2024\u2014a 20% increase from 2023\u2019s 450,000 searches.</p> \n<h3>3. Gel nail polish</h3> \n<p>Gel nail polisheshave been gaining serious momentum in recent years. They\u2019ve become popular products in salons and homes as a beautiful yet durable way to polish nails.</p> \n<p>Consumers must curegel nail polishesfor 30 to 60 seconds with a nail lamp (UV or LED) when applied. Using nail lamps seems like a tedious extra process, but it is necessary if consumers want their gel nails to harden and dry.</p> \n<p>The result? A glossy manicure that\u2019s worth the trouble! Consumers can also expect their gel nails to remain beautiful for up to two weeks.</p> \n<p>Like acrylic, ladies can also use gel nail polishes in many ways. They can apply them on their natural nails or use them to achieve a lengthening effect.\u00a0 Gel extensions are also available, as well as press-on nails.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s more. Similar to traditional polishes,gel variantsalso offer huge finish varieties. Consumers can get them in cream, matte, glitter, holographic, and cat-eye finishes.</p> \n<p>Gel nail polishes have gotten more attention in 2024. While they had a consistent following of 165,000 monthly searches, that number increased by 20% to 201,000 in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>4. Polygel</h3> \n<p>Some consumers love acrylic nails but not the process of applying them. For this reason, manufacturers createdpolygel, the perfect hybrid between acrylic and gel nail polishes.</p> \n<p>Instead of powder,these polisheshave gel-like consistencies that women can apply from a tube. Consumers can use them with brushes on their bare nails or extensions.</p> \n<p>The best part is that ladies can also use polygel to sculpt, fill, lengthen, and shape their nails. But they\u2019ll need LED lamps to cure them for maximum durability and beauty.</p> \n<p>Despite their ultra-durability,polygel nailsstill feel natural\u2013this is one of the reasons consumers love them. And polygel contains fewer chemicals, another plus in some people\u2019s books.</p> \n<p>Even better, polygel is odor-free and offers one of the longest wears, lasting up to three weeks\u2014what\u2019s not to love? 201,000 people agree that polygel is one of the best, as Google Data proves the number of potential customers searching for them in 2024.</p> \n<h3>5. Dip powder</h3> \n<p>Here\u2019s another powder formula many women love using for their nails.Dip powdersare widespread for their long-lasting formulas. They\u2019re durable enough to last up to a month, which helps push them onto the radar of consumers looking for something new.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more? Applyingdip powdersto nails is simple and quick. Consumers only need a base coat on their nails before using the powder. Then, they\u2019ll need a sealant to create a shiny overlay (like a top coat).</p> \n<p>Dip powdersare also straightforward. They don\u2019t require curing with LED lamps. Plus, their formulas dry in minutes after application without the help of a dryer.</p> \n<p>While dip powders may not be raking in huge numbers like the other trends on this list, they\u2019re attracting more attention this year. According to Google Data, interest in dip powders jumped from 60500 in FY 2023 to 74000 in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>In closing</h2> \n<p>There may be many nail polishes flooding the market, but only a few deserve the trending status. Millions of consumers do manicures every year, so it\u2019s no surprise that the nail polish market offers many business opportunities.</p> \n<p>Do consumers like the old style of nail care? Sellers can sell them traditional nail polishes. And if they want something more durable, polygel and acrylic nails are their best bet. Gel nails and dip powders appeal to women who love a glossy finish.</p> \n<p>Every trend listed here has thousands of people searching for it. So don\u2019t hesitate to stock up on them and grab a share of sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

They predict the market will experience a steady 3.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2028.</p> \n<p>The market has registered phenomenal growth in recent years due to rising consumer consciousness about nail care and the exploding nail art trend.

North America and Europe dominate the regional market, but the Asia-Pacific market is witnessing immense growth driven by urbanization, a growing retail sector, and increasing beauty awareness.</p> \n<h2>What are the types of nail polish removers?</h2> \n<p>Generally, the types boil down to acetone and non-acetone polish removers (more details below). However, the form in which sellers can purchase them differs regardless of the formula.</p> \n<h3>Bottled/liquid nail polish removers</h3> \n<p>Liquid nail polishremovers are currently dominating the global market. Many people love them for their convenience, versatility, and incredible effectiveness.</p> \n<p>But one of the key reasons women prefer these products is their ease of use.Liquid polish removerscome in bottles with pads or brushes, making it easy for ladies to target certain areas or remove nail polish in a few swipes.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s not all. Theliquid formulacan handle all kinds of polish, from regular to gel and glitter. Most liquid nail polish removers are non-toxic and acetone-free to address growing environmental and health concerns.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s the big seller: manufacturers enrich these products with ingredients to nourish and protect the nails. So, in addition to removing nail polish,liquid removerscan offer moisturizing and strengthening benefits.</p> \n<h3>Remover pads and wipes</h3> \n<p>Liquid nail removers may be very effective, but not everyone can carry them around.Remover pads and wipesare the unsung heroes when it comes to portability.</p> \n<p>These pads and wipescome pre-soaked in acetone or non-acetone solutions, making them the best options for on-the-go (and quick) nail polish removers. Do consumers have embarrassing layers of chipped nail polish? No problem! They can grab these pads to easily remove up to two coats of polish.</p> \n<h3>Corrector pen nail polish removers</h3> \n<p>While these bad boys also remove nail polish, they do it differently. Instead of removing entire layers of polish,corrector pensare the go-to products for removing small mistakes or imperfections during nail polish applications. Here\u2019s a brief look at the two different types:</p> \n<h2>What to consider when choosing nail polish removers</h2> \n<h3>Composition</h3> \n<p>As previously mentioned,nail polish removerscan have an acetone or non-acetone composition. This factor plays a role in consumers\u2019 buying decisions. But before explaining how, here\u2019s a look at what makes these formulas different.</p> \n<p>Acetone, on its own, is strong enough to dissolve plastic. It also has a pungent smell with some flammable characteristics. Before wondering why such a chemical is even in beauty products, understand that manufacturers dilute it enough not to melt the user\u2019s hands.</p> \n<p>Although diluted, acetone nail removers can dissolve the nail enamel before consumers remove it with a cotton pad. These nail removers may be effective, but consumers may avoid them due to their potential nail harm.</p> \n<p>In contrast,non-acetone polish removerscome with solvents like ethyl acetate, petroleum, and butyl acetate. For this reason, they\u2019re safer alternatives for nails since the solvents offer something milder.</p> \n<p>Non-acetone polish removers may also go the natural route with ingredients like citrus oils, vinegar, or baking soda. Gel removers also exist, but they\u2019re designed to remove only gel nail polish.</p> \n<h3>Effectiveness</h3> \n<p>Now that the differences between acetone and non-acetone polish removers are clear, what about their effectiveness? Acetone nail removers are the most common types because of their high effectiveness.</p> \n<p>Usually, they remove nail polish faster than non-acetone variants, as they\u2019re more likely to absorb the colors quicker. Non-acetone variants may be the safer option, but they take a few minutes more than theiracetone counterpartsto remove nail polish.</p> \n<p>Natural nail polish removers are also less effective than acetone and solvent variants. Similarly, gel removers may require soaking the nails for a few minutes before wiping off the polish.</p> \n<h3>Impact on the nails</h3> \n<p>Whileacetone nail polishremovers are super effective at their job, they have a larger impact. Using them once will rob the nails and cuticles of their natural moisture, and repeated or regular use will make the cuticles white and itchy.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s not all acetone nail removers can do. Consumers may also experience redness on the surrounding skin, leading to other harmful skin diseases. Ladies may also find their nails yellowing in the process.</p> \n<p>In contrast, non-acetone nail polish removers come with gentler formulas that do their job without harming the nails or the surrounding skin. It\u2019s one of the reasons non-acetone nail removers are becoming a more popular option.</p> \n<h3>Suitability</h3> \n<p>If consumers want stunning shellac manicures or glittering nail enamel, they can use acetone and non-acetone nail polish removers. However, non-acetone variants gain the upper hand for being mild enough to remove lighter and darker shades without harming the nails.</p> \n<p>Many experts recommend non-acetone nail polish remover for all kinds of polish colors, whether black polish, nude enamels, or coral nail colors. Non-acetone polish removers are also the best option for consumers who care about their natural nail color\u2014they\u2019ll leave the nails clear without any signs of yellowing.</p> \n<p>Becauseacetoneis harsh, nail polish removers made from the chemical are unsuitable for all skin types, especially dry and brittle nails. Contrarily, all non-acetone removers can work on any skin type, including sensitive ones.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>Acetone nail polishremovers have one goal, and they do it well. However, manufacturers may add other ingredients to combat the effects since their formulas are too strong. A typical acetone ingredient list looks like this:</p> \n<p>Non-acetone removers,on the other hand, often come with beneficial ingredients that make them even more attractive. In addition to the solvents listed above, sellers can find these additional ingredients:</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s easy to conclude that non-acetone nail polish removers are better investments, but not all consumers will agree. Despite acetone removers\u2019 harmful effects, some consumers still swear by them due to their speed and effectiveness (up to 22,000 searches for acetone nail polish removers in 2024).</p> \n<p>While many experts recommend using non-acetone polish removers, acetone variants remain popular. Nevertheless, non-acetone removers are catching up and may overtake their acetone counterparts as the world shifts toward better nail safety.</p> \n"}]}

Satin is the universal finish.</p> \n<p>If women with dry or combination skin don\u2019t want liquid concealers, they\u2019ll opt for cream-based ones.Cream concealersalso offer buildable coverage, ranging from full to medium.</p> \n<p>In addition to working great for dry skin, women can also choose betweena creamyor satin finish. The cream consistency and formula effectively hide discolorations, although they may crease after wearing for long hours.</p> \n<p>These concealersare like a miracle for ladies with sensitive skin. They don\u2019t contain any harsh chemicals, and women can work them into a powdery matte or satin finish, depending on their chosen product. Stick concealers also have a full to medium buildable coverage.</p> \n<h3>Understand skin tone requirements</h3> \n<p>Like other makeup products, the right concealer shade depends on the consumer\u2019s skin tone and undertone. Women can have warm, cool, or neutral undertones.</p> \n<p>Consumers with warm undertones will wantconcealerswith matching undertones\u2014the same goes for those with cool and neutral undertones. They may choose the exact match or opt for darker shades to create shadow effects for contouring.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, many manufacturers brand concealer shades with letter codes like N, C, or W to indicate if they\u2019re neutral, cool, or warm, making it easier for businesses to streamline their options.</p> \n<p>In the case of skin tone, consumers often choose their concealer shade based on their foundation. Women may also buy one lighter and darker shade as daily sun exposure is notorious for changing skin tone.</p> \n<h3>Know the consumer\u2019s skin concerns</h3> \n<p>Skin concerns andconcealer colorwork hand-in-hand, as different problems require different textures and colors. The color theory heavily plays into concealers since users will likely use them for color correction.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s more information on how concealer color is important in handling skin concerns.</p> \n<p>Ladies needing concealers for dark circles will lean towards warmer shades to avoid the eye area looking brighter than normal. As a result, orange to yellow-based concealers are perfect for handling blue-tinged and purplish dark circles.</p> \n<p>More importantly, ladies will choose one shade lighter than their skin tone to help hide the discoloration and naturally brighten the under-eye skin. In contrast, women with brownish-dark circles will prefer peach, orange, or salmon-based concealers.</p> \n<p>When redness is the primary concern, the safest bet isgreen concealers. Ladies can use them to easily neutralize any redness that seeps through the foundation, like blemishes, red spots, and pigmentation. Green concealers can also camouflage scars, rashes, acne, and angry red acne marks.</p> \n<p>Orange and peach-based concealers are the most effective in hiding dark spots from acne, sun damage, and aging\u2014even freckles, fine lines, and wrinkles are not out of reach.</p> \n<p>Likewise, blue and purple concealers can handle hyperpigmentation by brightening the skin and neutralizing dull or yellow undertones.</p> \n<p>Pimples need more than just color to disappear effectively. They need thicker and dry consistency for proper hiding, making cream concealers perfect. However, ladies will first need green color-correcting concealers to counteract the pimple\u2019s redness before hiding it with a cream concealer.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Gone are those days when skin concerns like pimples and redness could hinder makeup application. Now, women can use concealers to hide anything seeping through their foundation, allowing them to look spotless.</p> \n<p>Concealers are exploding in 2024, which indicates that more people want their benefits. Google data shows searches surged from 673,000 in 2023 to 825,000 in January 2024.</p> \n<p>These stats show now\u2019s a great time to jump into the concealer market, so don\u2019t hesitate to add them to your inventory in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

However, they expect it to grow by 8.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2030. Beauty and lifestyle awareness is a significant driver for the primer market. Online engagement is also helping to boost demand for these cosmetic products.</p> \n<p>In addition, increased spending among the global female population and rising adoption by beauty salons/clinics are also propelling revenue growth for the global primer market. Check out these stats for more information on the worldwide market:</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s the role of makeup primers in makeup routines?</h2> \n<p>Consumers get frustrated when their makeup melts away after a few hours. Some even hate when their makeup highlights their skin concerns. But that\u2019s because they apply their products on bare skin.</p> \n<p>If makeup is like painting,primersare the canvas. They create a barrier between the user\u2019s skin and makeup, helping it stick better and increase wear time.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all these desirable products can do.Makeup primerscan help consumers combat skin concerns like dryness, sensitivity, or excess oil.</p> \n<p>They can also handle blurring out wrinkles and fine lines while covering up notorious pores. The goal here is to make the look seamless and flawless!</p> \n<h2>Types of makeup primers</h2> \n<p>Primers come in different varieties with various effects to help prepare faces for makeup. Here\u2019s a look at all the primer types:</p> \n<h3>Matte primers</h3> \n<p>Matte primersare the go-to for smoothing fine lines and blurring pesky pores\u2014they also help increase foundation wear time. These primers contain silicone to give them their mattifying nature.</p> \n<p>The silicone inmatte primersalso helps fill out pores, creating a smooth, even texture for smooth face makeup application. Moreover, matte primers are tacky, allowing them to secure foundations and concealers\u2014no more makeup melting!</p> \n<h3>Hydrating primers</h3> \n<p>These primersare like the opposite of matte variants. Instead of filling out pores, hydrating primers do what their name says: moisturizing the skin. Usually, they come with moisturizing oils and nourishing ingredients like antioxidants and hyaluronic acid.</p> \n<p>Other than moisturizing the skin,these primersensure the skin receives enough nourishment to eliminate dry patches. The result of these pesky dry patches is usually cakey and creased makeup, but hydrating primers help prevent all that.</p> \n<h3>Illuminating primer</h3> \n<p>Not allprimersaim to solve skin concerns. Some just help add that \u201cglow\u201d to makeup looks\u2014the perfect description for illuminating primers.</p> \n<p>Illuminating primersare similar to silicone (matte) primers but add a hint or sheen instead of a complete mattifying look. So, using foundation on top, these primers will create a lovely, dewy, and glass-like appearance for special occasions and events.</p> \n<h3>Color correcting primer</h3> \n<p>If consumers struggle with under-eye dark circles or rosacea, they\u2019ll use color-correctingprimers. These products contain colors that help correct uneven colors and subdue the skin\u2019s undertone.</p> \n<p>For example, green color-correctingprimerswill help counteract redness on the face. In other words, redness won\u2019t seep through the user\u2019s foundation.</p> \n<h3>Gel-based face primers</h3> \n<p>These are the most commonprimer formulasavailable. Although gel primers are helpful for sensitive skin, they suit skin types. Plus, they\u2019re incredibly easy to apply and achieve a smooth base.</p> \n<h3>Silicone-free face primers</h3> \n<p>Silicone-based primers have incredible benefits. But most makeup pushes for less silicone due to its comedogenic nature (more acne and blackhead breakouts).</p> \n<p>For this reason,silicone-free primersare gaining incredible momentum, with water-based primers leading the charge. While water-based primers are great for hydrating the skin, they also help achieve a smooth look.</p> \n<h3>Anti-aging face primers</h3> \n<p>Think of regular primers but with in-built anti-aging formulas\u2014that\u2019s the best way to describe these amazing primers.</p> \n<p>Mostanti-aging face primersare silicone-free, containing essential hydrating ingredients like vitamins, antioxidants, and fatty acids. These ingredients easily help women maintain a young and healthy face.</p> \n<h2>Considerations worth noting to attract women in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Primers for oily skin</h3> \n<p>Consumers complaining about shiny or greasy makeup a few hours after application likely have oily skin. So, looking for face primers, they\u2019ll search for formulas containing excess sebum control. The top picks here are matte or oil-free primers.</p> \n<p>To cater to these consumers, businesses must prioritize primers with ingredients like salicylic acid to handle the excess oil and a mattifying effect to keep the shine at bay.</p> \n<p>And, if the skin is breakout or blemish-prone, stocking up on non-comedogenic primers will attract these consumers. Such primers help prevent unwanted breakouts and spots, keeping one\u2019s skin happy and healthy.</p> \n<h3>Primers for dry skin</h3> \n<p>Dry-skinned consumers complain about itching and flakiness, so they avoid mattifying primers. Instead, they\u2019ll go for hydrating primers containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid.</p> \n<p>Consumers with dry skin need an intense hydration boost during makeup routines, making hydrating primers their top solution. These primers will also leave their skin looking radiant and dewy\u2014a win-win situation for dry skin!</p> \n<p>Some illuminating primers also help ladies with dry skin. They may help lock in moisture and stop the skin from losing its moisture. Hence, these consumers use illuminating primers to uplift their dull complexion.</p> \n<h3>Primers for combination skin</h3> \n<p>Combination-skinned consumers need a bit of everything. They search for primers that balance their dry and oily areas without feeling too heavy or greasy.</p> \n<p>For this reason, offering lightweight, hydrating formulas will be the perfect choice for combination skin. These formulas will help counteract excess shine on the T-zone while hydrating the skin appropriately.</p> \n<h3>Primers for sensitive skin</h3> \n<p>Things can easily go wrong for consumers with sensitive skin, so they\u2019re extra careful with the makeup products they use, including primers. To prevent their skin from appearing red and itchy all the time, sensitive-skinned women prioritize hypoallergenic ingredients.</p> \n<p>They also prefer fragrance and paraben-free primers with cool and soothing formulas, like gel-based variants. On the other hand, if these ladies constantly deal with skin redness, green color-correcting primers can help them refine their skin\u2019s look and feel.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Ladies don\u2019t need to apply makeup products on their bare skin anymore. They can use primers to ensure their natural skin conditions won\u2019t affect their final look.</p> \n<p>These products are not just popular on paper. Their Google data shows they\u2019ve racked up considerable interest in 2024. Primers have attracted 825,000 searches in January, proving they\u2019re a worthwhile investment this year.</p> \n<p>But hold those horses. Remember to consider the target consumer\u2019s skin type before investing in makeup primers. Alternatively, retailers can stock up on a bit of everything to cater to everyone\u2019s requirements.</p> \n"}]}

A study led by Hyuk Chul Kwon has revealed that exposure to common air pollutants, notably from burning fossil fuels, significantly reduces the proteins essential for hair growth and retention. This finding suggests that air pollution could be a hidden factor in hair loss, broadening our understanding of its harmful effects.</p> \n<h2>Understanding particulate matterand its impact</h2> \n<p>Particulate matter (PM) is a major component of air pollution, consisting of tiny particles and droplets suspended in the air. These particles, which contribute to the visible haze on days of poor air quality, have now been linked to adverse effects on scalp health. By reducing levels of \u03b2-catenin, a protein crucial for hair growth, PM exposure directly threatens the vitality of our hair follicles.</p> \n<h2>The science behind pollution-induced hair loss</h2> \n<p>Research investigating the effect of air pollution on hair health has shown that exposure to dust and diesel particulate matter decreases the levels of proteins vital for hair growth. This disruption to the hair growth cycle can lead to noticeable hair loss, highlighting the importance of understanding and combating pollution\u2019s role in hair health.</p> \n<h2>Expert perspectives on scalp health and pollution</h2> \n<p>Experts in trichology and dermatology emphasize the significance of scalp health in maintaining healthy hair growth. Pollution\u2019s detrimental impact on skin health can extend to the scalp, affecting hair follicles and potentially leading to hair loss.

However, their effectiveness depends on the consumers.</p> \n<p>But one certain fact is that tanning lotions can help accelerate the tanning process or providesunless self-tanning. Typically, they contain ingredients that stimulate melanin production to give consumers a darker color.</p> \n<p>However, how effective tanning lotions will be depends on skin type. Undoubtedly, some people may experience a more noticeable tan, while others may see only minimal effects.</p> \n<p>Regardless,tanning lotionsare still profitable enough to sell in 2024. According to Google Ads data, tanning lotions peaked in the summer (and pre-summer) of 2023, with 450,000 searches monthly from April to June.</p> \n<p>With summer around the corner, businesses can expect another surge in demand in 2024. The good news is that tanning lotions already started the year with a healthy 201,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>Is the market big enough to make profits in 2024?</h2> \n<p>Tanning lotions are under theself-tanning market, which nearly crossed the $1 billion mark in 2022, closing the year with US $909.2 million. However, experts predict that the market will join the \u201cbillion gang\u201d by reaching $1.31 billion in value by 2030, growing at a 4.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>Check out these statistics to learn more about the market:</p> \n<h2>What to look at when adding tanning lotions to beauty inventories in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Tanning lotion type</h3> \n<p>The myth that alltanning lotionsare the same stinks with falsehood. Although they achieve the same results (darker skin), tanning lotions differ. Various types are available on the market, each offering a different approach to giving consumers the famous bronzer glow.</p> \n<p>The most common tanning lotion types include bronzers, intensifiers, maximizers, accelerators, and tingle lotions. Here\u2019s a closer look at each of them:</p> \n<p>These products are what people refer to when they say \u201cself-tanning lotion.\u201d Bronzers feature temporary self-tanning agents that immediately add color to the skin. Although these lotions offer quick results, they\u2019re not long-lasting.</p> \n<p>Tans from bronzers typically wash off after a few showers or days. However, they\u2019re the go-to for people who want a quick, temporary tan. Bronzers also have two types under their belt: instant and gradual.</p> \n<p>Whileinstant bronzersgive immediate results until consumers decide to wash them off, gradual variants build up color over time to create a more natural-looking tan.</p> \n<p>Intensifiersdon\u2019t offer any self-tanning agents. Instead, they help consumers achieve a darker, deeper tan. What intensifiers do is stimulate melanin production to give impressive results over time\u2014they\u2019re not the best for consumers searching for an instant tan.</p> \n<p>Similar to intensifiers,maximizerscan help consumers get a darker tan. However, manufacturers pack them with more active ingredients to start melanin production faster than intensifiers.</p> \n<p>Maximizers are a favorite for experienced tanners, especially those with a base tan who want something deeper. Don\u2019t offer them to beginners\u2014they may irritate their skin and not provide the desired results.</p> \n<p>Speaking of base tans, accelerators are the mosteffective lotiontypes for creating them. They often have ingredients that help consumers achieve a base tan faster. Accelerators increase blood flow to the skin, enabling it to absorb more UV rays for a long-lasting tan.</p> \n<p>Additionally, accelerators don\u2019t contain bronzers or self-tanners. As a result, they won\u2019t provide immediate color.</p> \n<p>These lotionsuse ingredients (like benzyl nicotine) that make the skin tingle when applied. This tingling sensation happens when the lotion increases blood flow to the skin, so most people see it as a sign that it\u2019s working.</p> \n<p>However, it\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling for some people. Regardless, tingle lotions are the fastest way to get a deeper, darker tan (not recommended for users with sensitive skin).</p> \n<h3>Consumer\u2019s skin type</h3> \n<p>While lotion type is important, knowing the target consumer\u2019s skin type determines whether the product is great for them. So, sellers must consider it when stocking up ontanning lotions. Check the table below for common skin types and suitable tanning lotions.</p> \n<h3>The desired tan\u2019s depth</h3> \n<p>Alltanning lotionscome with DHA (dihydroxyacetone), an active ingredient for skin darkening. However, lotions can come with varying degrees of DHA, determining the depth of the tan consumers will get.</p> \n<p>Experts recommend lotion with lower DHA levels to consumers with lighter skin tones for a natural-looking tone. On the other hand, darker skin tones may need higher DHA concentrations to see any difference. Check the table below for more details:</p> \n<h3>Duration and ease of removal</h3> \n<p>Another thing to consider is how long consumers will want the tan to last and how easy it will be to remove. Manufacturers designsome productsto fade or wash away gradually after about a week, while others may need tan removers.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Tanning lotions are great ways to achieve a darker look during the summer. However, tanning results rely greatly on the application method. While consumers can apply lotions by hand, they may consider using applicator mitts for a more even application.</p> \n<p>Businesses can offer these mitts in a set with their tanning lotions or sell them separately to draw more profits from the tanning lotion market. More importantly, leverage the factors discussed to know what tanning lotions to stock up on ahead of summer sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

According to Brown, the traditional cat eye is no longer the norm. Instead, she\u2019s seeing a shift towards more artistic and creative eyeliner designs, incorporating a spectrum of colors. \u201cPeople are looking for something more unique and eye-catching,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to make a statement with their makeup through bold and vibrant colors.\u201d</p> \n<p>To achieve these colorful looks, Brown is using a variety of techniques. She\u2019s experimenting with modern reverse liner, which involves applying eyeliner in a way that creates a reverse cat eye effect, but with a pop of color. This look involves lining the outer corner of the eye first, and then connecting it to the inner corner, creating a smooth, rounded line. Whether it\u2019s a modern reverse cat eye in electric blue or a bold, daring line in neon green, Brown is encouraging clients to embrace their creativity and individuality when it comes to eyeliner. \u201cMakeup is all about expressing yourself and feeling confident in your own skin,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see where this trend takes us and how people will continue to push the boundaries of eye makeup with colorful expressions.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Superior to Being Uncovered: Lightweight Foundation</h2> \n<p>Recently, the beauty world has witnessed a shift away from heavy, cakey foundations and towards lightweight, buildable options. Major brands such as MAC, Covergirl, and Fenty Beauty are leading the charge with formulas that provide adequate coverage without feeling heavy or suffocating on the skin.</p> \n<p>According to industry insiders, consumers are demanding more natural-looking finishes that enhance their skin tone without looking too perfect. \u201cPeople want to look like themselves, not like they\u2019re wearing a ton of makeup,\u201d explains a beauty buyer at a major retailer. \u201cFoundations that provide buildable coverage and a lightweight feel are the new must-haves.\u201d</p> \n<p>To meet this demand, brands are developing innovative technologies that allow for sheer, breathable coverage. These formulas often feature lighter-weight ingredients such as silicones, polymers, or organic extracts that provide a more natural appearance without compromising on coverage.</p> \n<p>While lightweight foundations are gaining popularity, they\u2019re not necessarily a new concept. Brands like Nars and Laura Mercier have been offering buildable, lightweight formulas for years. However, the trend towards lighter weight coverage is expected to continue as consumers increasingly prioritize natural-looking makeup that enhances their skin without feeling heavy or artificial.</p> \n<h2>Dress to Impress: Doll Blush</h2> \n<p>\u201cDoll blush\u201d is in trend at the beauty world, with a focus on applying blush to the apples of the cheeks for a youthful and sculpted look. Los Angeles-based makeup artist Patrick Ta is at the forefront of this trend, recommending that clients blend out the edges for a softer, more gradient effect. Ta notes that the key to achieving this ethereal effect is using products like Armani Beauty\u2019s Luminous Silk Glow blush, which has a creamy texture that blends seamlessly into the skin and provides a subtle, buildable glow. \u201cThis product is perfect for creating a soft, natural-looking glow on the cheeks,\u201d Ta says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about blending out the edges and creating a gradient effect that enhances the natural contours of the face.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to Ta, the doll blush trend is all about creating a youthful, sculpted look that\u2019s both feminine and elegant. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift away from bold, dramatic makeup and towards a more subtle, understated look,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe goal is to enhance the natural beauty of the face without looking too done-up or artificial.\u201d By following this trend, clients can achieve a doll-like glow that\u2019s both ethereal and elegant. With the right products and techniques, it\u2019s possible to create a look that\u2019s both youthful and sophisticated \u2013 the perfect combination for any occasion</p> \n<h2>Embrace Monochrome: Cohesive Looks</h2> \n<p>The monochromatic makeup trend is still going strong, with many clients asking for looks that feature similar shades on the lips and face. Los Angeles-based makeup artist Ami Cole is at the forefront of this trend, using products like her Desert Date Cream Blush & Lip Multistick to create a cohesive, put-together look that\u2019s both easy to apply and versatile.</p> \n<p>According to Cole, the key to pulling off a monochromatic makeup look is using shades that complement each other without looking too matchy-matchy. \u201cYou want to create a harmonious, cohesive look that still allows for individuality and creativity,\u201d she explains. \u201cUsing similar shades on the lips and face can help to create a more polished, put-together finish.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the biggest benefits of monochromatic makeup is its versatility. Products like Cole\u2019s Desert Date Cream Blush & Lip Multistick can be used on both the lips and face, making them incredibly convenient for clients who want a quick, easy makeup look. \u201cThese types of products save time and effort in the application process, while still providing a cohesive, put-together look,\u201d Cole notes.</p> \n<p>Overall, the monochromatic makeup trend is all about simplicity and versatility. By using similar shades on the lips and face, clients can achieve a sleek, polished look that\u2019s both easy to apply and visually striking</p> \n<h2>Bright Swiping: Colorful Eyelashes</h2> \n<p>In 2024, the beauty world is embracing a new trend: colored eyelashes. Gone are the days of plain black or brown lashes, as models on the runways of Prada and AZ Factory have been sporting vibrant shades of blue, pink, and purple. To achieve this bold look, makeup artists are turning to products like YSL\u2019s Lash Clash and Half Magic Eyelectric Extreme Lengthening Mascara. These products allow for adding a pop of color to the lashes, creating a fun and playful effect that\u2019s sure to turn heads.</p> \n<p>According to makeup artist Sarah Nguyen, \u201cColored eyelashes are all about making a statement and having fun with your beauty routine. It\u2019s a great way to add some personality and creativity to your look.\u201d Overall, colored eyelashes are all about having fun and expressing yourself through makeup. With the right products and techniques, anyone can achieve this bold and beautiful look.</p> \n<h2>Gradient Lips: The Modern Ombre</h2> \n<p>In 2024, the 1990s ombre lip trend has made a comeback with a modern twist. Makeup artists are now recommending using two shades of lipstick in the same color family to create a natural gradient effect. This can be achieved by pairing a tan brown with a rusty pink, for example. To achieve this look, makeup artists suggest using a product like the Ere Perez Coco Crayon. This lip crayon has a rich matte finish and blends seamlessly into the lips, allowing for a natural-looking gradient effect.</p> \n<p>Rhodes also notes that the modern twist on this trend is all about customization. \u201cClients want to be able to express their individuality through makeup, and the ombre lip trend allows them to do just that,\u201d she explains. \u201cBy using two shades of lipstick, they can create a look that\u2019s uniquely their own.\u201d Overall, the 1990s ombre lip trend has been reborn with a modern twist. With the right products and techniques, anyone can achieve this beautiful, gradient effect</p> \n<h2>Final Words: A New Chapter in Beauty</h2> \n<p>As we wrap up our exploration of the top makeup trends for 2024, it\u2019s clear that this year is all about embracing change and pushing the boundaries of creativity.

But not all blackhead removers are made the same\u2014some are more effective than others, depending on skin type.</p> \n<p>This article will explore six amazing products to help consumers treat pesky blackheads, which will help retailers boost their sales in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow big is the blackhead remover product market?6 effective blackhead removers to know in 2024Bottom line</p> \n<h2>How big is the blackhead remover product market?</h2> \n<p>Blackhead removers are part of theacne treatment market, which experts valued at USD 11.09 billion in 2023. According to research, the parent market will hit USD 15.70 billion by 2030, registering a 5.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The increase in skin disorders is the major factor driving global demand for acne treatment products. Experts say the 18 to 44-year-old segment will account for the highest share over the forecast period, while the 10 to 17-year-old sector will register considerable growth.</p> \n<p>North America emerged as the dominant region in 2022, accounting for USD 5.16 billion of the USD 10.48 billion revenue. Europe follows closely behind as the second-highest contributor to the global acne treatment product market. Asia Pacific will also register the highest CAGR over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>6 effective blackhead removers to know in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Blackhead remover serum</h3> \n<p>These topical skincare products are one of the best ways to unclog and minimize the appearance of blackheads.Blackhead remover serumstypically contain various ingredient combinations that work together to ensure blackheads don\u2019t make consumers uncomfortable.</p> \n<p>Some common but effective ingredients manufacturers add to theirblackhead remover serumsinclude the following.</p> \n<h3>Pore strips</h3> \n<p>Pore stripsare an amazing way to remove a lot of gunk from the skin, including blackheads. They\u2019re strips of materials with adhesives strong enough to stick to the skin and rip out impurities.</p> \n<p>Whilepore stripswon\u2019t fix blackhead problems permanently, they will help make the skin appear smoother. Regardless of the results, pore strips are one of the best products for overall pore detoxification.</p> \n<p>Pore stripscan also come with skin-soothing ingredients to reduce reactions to ripping things out of the skin. For instance, some nose strips formulate charcoal, antibacterial volcanic ash, and antioxidant-rich bamboo extracts to minimize the look of pores and eliminate congestion gently and effectively.</p> \n<p>In addition to that, they\u2019ll come with nourishing ingredients, like aloe, sacred lotus flower, and allantoin, to soothe the after-effects of the pore strips (sensitivity, redness, and inflammation).</p> \n<h3>Facial masks</h3> \n<p>Facial masksare also making a debut as an effective blackhead remover. But of all types available, only a few can handle combating stubborn blackheads. Clay masks are one of the most effective at this, however. This is becauseclay maskshelp remove toxins and oil from the skin, which also unclogs pores hosting blackheads. In fact, this is why many experts consider clay masks as must-haves for consumers with oily skin.</p> \n<p>These beauty products may also contain sulfur, anotherfamous ingredientfor effective blackhead treatment. Sulfur helps break down dead skin cells that help blackheads form, possibly preventing them from forming again after unclogging pores.</p> \n<p>Charcoal masksare another great option. These facial masks penetrate deep into the skin to extract oils and other impurities. Unlike clay masks, charcoal variants adhere to the skin, ripping out all the attracted impurities during removal\u2014like a better version of pore strips!</p> \n<h3>Facial cleansers</h3> \n<p>While many considerfacial cleansersas \u201cmakeup removers,\u2019 they\u2019re also effective in eliminating dead skin cells, oil, and dirt\u2014all notorious for creating blackheads. However, facial cleansers are a bit tricky for blackhead removal.</p> \n<p>Consumers can\u2019t use just anyfacial cleanser. They\u2019ll need ones with strategic ingredients like salicylic acid, retinoids, witch hazel, glycolic acid, and charcoal to effectively remove dead skin and cleanse the pores of all the rubbish.</p> \n<p>After a routine use, consumers may see blackheads popping out with gentle pressure. However, not all facial cleansers may reach deep enough to eliminate blackheads. However, they\u2019re a great way to prevent them from forming!</p> \n<h3>Face scrubs</h3> \n<p>Exfoliation is another super way to fight stubborn blackheads, andface scrubsare emerging as an awesome way to do it. From reducing the chances of breakouts to removing dead skin cells, face scrubs help solve many skin concerns.</p> \n<p>Face scrubscome packed with coarse particles that help users exfoliate their skin. The particles rub against the skin to effectively remove all dirt and unclog pores while making it smoother and softer.</p> \n<p>However,face scrubsare notorious for sucking out the face\u2019s natural moisture and irritating the skin if done too hard. So, consumers may need a gentle and natural moisturizer to replenish the lost hydration after exfoliating.</p> \n<h3>Chemical peels</h3> \n<p>Althoughchemical peelsoriginally provided anti-aging benefits, they often contain BHAs and AHAs (necessary ingredients that help fight blackheads), which makes them valuable in dealing with blackheads.</p> \n<p>The best part ischemical peelsalso work by exfoliating the skin, which (in theory) leaves the skin smoother and more refreshed after application. While chemical peels are not primary treatments for blackheads, they can help remove dead skin cells and shrink enlarged pores.</p> \n<p>Chemical peels are also the best options for people seeking anti-aging benefits with blackhead treatments.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Blackheads are annoying, but they don\u2019t have to be a cause of discomfort for consumers. Our current technologies have pushed various blackhead treatments into the market, offering consumers a range of options to choose from.</p> \n<p>However, some consumers end up with products that won\u2019t work for them, pushing them to continue their search for the perfect solution. Focus on blackhead remover serums, facial masks, facial cleansers, face scrubs, pore strips, and chemical peels to attract these consumers and boost your sales while providing a valuable solution to your buyers in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all products, as consumers demand more from their haircare routines. This blog post delves into the latest trends shaping the future of haircare, focusing on first-aid haircare, embracing curls, and next-gen styling products. These trends highlight a shift towards tailored solutions that cater to fluctuating needs, celebrate diversity, and prioritize hair health, setting the stage for a more inclusive and holistic approach to hair care.</p> \n<h2>First-aid haircare: tailored solutions for fluctuating needs</h2> \n<p>The future of haircare is dynamic and personalized, with first-aid haircare leading the charge in offering tailored solutions for fluctuating needs. This trend focuses on addressing the individualized needs of consumers, which vary based on environmental factors, life stages, or pre-existing conditions. For example, K-beauty brand Steambase has introduced the Tea Tree Scalp Water Scaler, targeting oily scalps and scalp odor with a potent mix of 3% tea tree extract to cool the scalp and salicylic acid to dissolve sebum and dead skin cells without drying the scalp. Similarly, FDA-approved Jupiter from the US aims to destigmatize dandruff with its simplified packaging range of haircare solutions.</p> \n<p>The movement towards first-aid haircare also embraces targeted solutions that support fluctuating emotions, hormones, and scalp sensitivities. This is particularly favored among \u201cSkintentional\u201d consumers who seek products that align with their holistic health and beauty routines. Age-agnostic haircare, highlighted by Dyson\u2019s 2022 Global Hair Study, reveals that concerns such as dandruff, hair loss, and greying are prevalent across various demographics, not just those over 40. The study underscores the demand for products that address growth, fullness, breakage, and scalp stimulation, with ingredients like rosemary oil, locally sourced salt, lactic acid, and caffeine being key to tackling these issues.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, hormonal fluctuations from pregnancy, menopause, to menstrual cycles are being addressed with new formulations. Oh Hey Mama, for example, offers a scalp care routine targeting postpartum, hormonal, and aging hair concerns, including a scalp wash, hair serum, conditioner, and scalp massager to stimulate growth. This trend emphasizes the need for haircare to adapt to the intuitive practices of skincare, suggesting a growing market for products that respond to hormonal changes affecting hair health.</p> \n<p>First-aid haircare is not just a trend but a response to the evolving understanding of hair health. It represents a shift in consumer expectations, where haircare products are expected to be as responsive and personalized as skincare. This approach not only promises better hair health outcomes but also aligns with a more inclusive and comprehensive view of beauty and wellness, catering to the unique needs of each individual.</p> \n<h2>Embracing curls: products for curly and coily hair types</h2> \n<p>The inclusivity movement within the haircare industry has significantly expanded to embrace curly and coily hair types, with a focus on offering targeted solutions that cater specifically to the needs of these textures. This shift is evidenced by brands like OurX, which not only provides a glossary of ingredients and hair terminology on its website but also offers personalized haircare regimens for curl types 3-4. This approach includes education on repairing damage, managing porosity, and recommending protective styles, addressing the unique challenges of curly and coily hair.</p> \n<p>Rebundle, another pioneering brand, has introduced braid extensions made from naturally extracted banana fibers as a sustainable and scalp-friendly alternative to traditional plastic synthetic hair. This innovation not only reduces scalp irritation associated with protective styles but also aligns with environmental sustainability through its biodegradable ReGen Hair Fiber.</p> \n<p>The haircare market\u2019s expansion into curly and coily hair products is not just about diversification but about filling a long-standing gap in the industry. According to Carra\u2019s 2023 Texture Gap Report, online conversations about type 4 hair are notably active, with many expressing concerns over dryness, breakage, and the challenge of detangling. Products like Richualist\u2019s The Mint, a hair tool designed specifically for 4C hair types, make styling not only more efficient but also more enjoyable, enabling even distribution of products during the detangling process.</p> \n<p>This trend towards embracing curls and advocating for inclusive products represents a critical step forward in addressing the needs of the one billion people worldwide with textured hair. It underscores the importance of prioritizing education and accessibility to ensure that all hair types are recognized and catered to, offering personalized and texture-specific solutions that promote hair health and beauty.</p> \n<h2>Next-gen styling: health-centric styling products</h2> \n<p>The revolution in hair styling is increasingly pivoting towards products that not only meet aesthetic desires but also nourish and protect hair health. This new era, epitomized by brands like Prose and TOUN28, is introducing products that blend style with substance. For instance, Prose\u2019s Custom Styling Gel, composed of over 97% natural ingredients including aloe vera, okra, and sea moss, allows users to choose from three non-crunchy hold levels tailored to their hair type, demonstrating a commitment to both performance and hair health.</p> \n<p>TOUN28, a Korea-based brand, has taken innovation a step further with its Mindful Hair Perfume Mist, which features green tulip rich in collagen. This product stands out by encapsulating its ingredients in oil bubbles that burst upon contact with hair, maintaining freshness and offering a sensory experience that also benefits hair health. Ceremonia\u2019s Pequi Styling Gel, for example, utilizes a\u00e7ai extract, aloe vera powder, and pequi oil to improve shine, decrease frizz, and nourish strands, embodying the essence of health-centric styling.</p> \n<p>These innovations underscore a significant shift towards styling products that are as concerned with hair health as they are with aesthetic appeal. They represent a response to growing consumer expectations for multifunctional products that deliver both immediate styling results and long-term health benefits, setting a new standard for the industry and pointing towards a future where the health of the hair is not sacrificed for style.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion:</h2> \n<p>The haircare industry is undergoing a transformative shift, with first-aid haircare, inclusivity for curly and coily hair types, and health-centric styling products leading the way. These trends reflect a deeper understanding of individual needs and a commitment to providing personalized, effective solutions. As we embrace these innovations, the future of haircare looks promising, with products that not only enhance our beauty but also nurture our hair\u2019s health. The message is clear: in the world of haircare, personalization, inclusivity, and health are not just trends but essential pillars for the future.</p> \n"}]}

Closing 2023 with USD 1.11 billion, experts predictthe global marketwill reach USD 1.59 billion at a 5.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2024 to 2030.</p> \n<h2>Tanning products: 5 trends consumers will love for summer 2024</h2> \n<h3>Tanning lotions</h3> \n<p>Winter is over; consumers are reaching for sunless tanners to beat their pale complexions.Tanning lotionsare among the first picks, as consumers only need to slather them on and enjoy a fake tan indoors or outdoors.</p> \n<p>These lotionscome with DHA to give consumers their much-needed synthetic bronze. They react with the amino acids on the skin\u2019s surface, effectively darkening it to create an attractive summer look without exposure to the sun\u2019s radiation.</p> \n<p>But what if consumers want a more natural tan? They can go fortanning lotionsthat help quicken the bronzing process. Manufacturers infuse these with certain oils to help consumers absorb more ultraviolet rays by triggering melanin production.</p> \n<p>Tanning lotions have started the year with an amazing search performance as many consumers are gearing up for the upcoming summer. According to Google data, they attracted 201,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Serums</h3> \n<p>Some consumers may see tanning lotions as unsafe. Thankfully, they have other options that fit their tastes. If they\u2019re looking for a quick and safe way to get a natural-looking golden glow,tanning serumsmay be the answer.</p> \n<p>Tanning serums don\u2019t apply a fake layer of bronze. Instead, they gradually enhance the skin\u2019s natural color, creating a sun-kissed glow without exposure to harmful UV rays.</p> \n<p>Unlike traditional self-tanners that interact with the skin\u2019s outermost layer,tanning serumspenetrate deeper to stimulate melanin production. Tanning serums also come with tyrosine to help maintain the tan for longer.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all.Tanning serumsalso take skin type into consideration. Most formulas contain nourishing ingredients (like hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, and vitamin E) to hydrate and protect the skin.</p> \n<p>If consumers want an extra glow, some tanning serums include shimmer or light-reflecting particles to enhance the skin\u2019s radiance. Based on Google data, 5,400 consumers have searched for tanning serums in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Tanning water</h3> \n<p>Tanning with lotions and serums can be tricky. If consumers don\u2019t have enough dexterity, they may end up with unsightly streaks and blotches. However, consumers can say bye-bye to such issues withtanning water.</p> \n<p>This self-tanner is DHA (dihydroxyacetone) suspended in water. For this reason, the formula is clear, meaning nothing will transfer onto bed sheets or clothing, allowing consumers to tan without worries about staining.</p> \n<p>Even better, the formula\u2019s water base means every application delivers hydration to the skin.Tanning wateris also lightweight enough to work on or under makeup, so consumers can apply it easily before engaging in daily activities\u2014they sink in instantly, too!</p> \n<p>Althoughtanning watermakes at-home tanning hassle-free, it still has its considerations. Businesses must prioritize formulas infused with skin-friendly ingredients, like vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. Anti-aging ingredients are also great to have in tanning waters.</p> \n<p>Avoid stocking up on tanning water with parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. Google data shows these products have raked in 27100 searches in January 2024, a 20% boost from 2023\u2019s 22,200 inquiries.</p> \n<h3>Sprays</h3> \n<p>While all tanning waters are sprays, not all sprays are tanning water.These productsdispense fine mists that penetrate the skin\u2019s top layer to create a darkened effect. However, what sets these self-tanners apart is that they come in three different forms.</p> \n<p>The first one is DIY spray tans. These are ready-to-use products that allow consumers to get a natural-looking tan without visiting the salon. The best part is these spray tans are incredibly easy to use\u2014and consumers can achieve an even tan by following the given instructions.</p> \n<p>Tanning boothsare the second spray tan method. Many consumers love these machines for their effectiveness and long-lasting results. Spray tanning booths can automatically calculate the spray consumers need for a complete tan. However, they require the help of a professional, so consumers may need to make trips to the salon.</p> \n<p>Lastly, airbrush tanning is another great way to apply spray tans. This technique uses an airbrush machine to apply the spray tan evenly on the body. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the most time-consuming method and needs assistance from another person\u2014but the results are worth it!</p> \n<p>According to Google data, DIY spray tans and tanning booths attracted 201,000 searches in January 2024. However, airbrush tanning is a more niche market, drawing only 6,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Tanning mousse</h3> \n<p>While all these tanning products are great, none are as versatile as thetanning mousse. This self-tanner is one the most effective ways to get a seamless tan resembling sun-kissed skin.</p> \n<p>These self-tannersare popular for their foamy mousse formula, which makes them incredibly easy to apply. Consumers must massage them into their skin and wait for their bronze glow to pop.</p> \n<p>Some consumers feeltanning mousseshave runny formulas that may mess up their application. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case. Although water-based, these self-tanners are consistent enough to help achieve that faux glow without mishaps.</p> \n<p>While consumers can use their hands to apply this self-tanner, they\u2019ll get better results from using applicator mitts. Tanning mousses are one of the more popular tanning products. They\u2019ve garnered a significant search interest, reaching 165,000 searches in January 2024.</p> \n<h2>In conclusion</h2> \n<p>When consumers became aware of the potential dangers of letting UV rays soak into the skin, self-tanning products emerged as a safer alternative to getting a sun-kissed glow. Various types have popped up in the market, allowing businesses to offer enough variety and attract more attention.</p> \n<p>However, tanning products are seasonal products.

Aloe vera was quite popular in the Egyptian time for oral and topical applications.</p> \n<p>It\u2018s safe to say that it has maintained its popularity in modern times but with a twist. Manufacturers have drawn out other aloe vera gel skincare benefits, making them much more than skin rash and sunburn treatments.</p> \n<p>This article explores why aloe vera gels are a game changer for retailers and it provides essential tips on how sellers can detect the original from the fakes.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsIs the aloe vera gel market growing in 2024?Why consumers are yearning for aloe vera gels in 2024How sellers can detect fake aloe vera gelsPoints to remember when adding aloe vera gels to your inventoryRounding up</p> \n<h2>Is the aloe vera gel market growing in 2024?</h2> \n<p>The 2020s gave the \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d trend more momentum, and consumers started paying more attention to their cosmetic products. As a result, aloe vera gels entered the spotlight and have been on a steady growth path ever since.</p> \n<p>According to experts, theglobal aloe vera gel marketwill grow from USD 337.7 million in 2022 to USD 712.3 million in 2032 at a 7.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Although aloe vera gel is a trend-driven market, it\u2019s showing enough potential to remain lucrative over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The rising consciousness among consumers to look good and enhance outer appearances is also spearheading the aloe vera gel market\u2019s growth. As chemically-made cosmetic products witness a downward spiral, organic products (like aloe vera gels) are gaining popularity.</p> \n<p>Asia Pacific is a significant regional player in the aloe vera gel market, with experts predicting it will remain dominant with an 8.8% CAGR. Due to the increasing population and higher consumer spending capacity, China and India are the most prominent markets.</p> \n<h2>Why consumers are yearning for aloe vera gels in 2024</h2> \n<p>Aloe vera gelsrank high among the top organic cosmetic products in 2024, and for good reason. They come packed with anti-inflammatory and cooling properties, making them one of the most natural solutions for burns (or sunburns), small scratches, and insect bites.</p> \n<p>But if that\u2019s all they could do, consumers wouldn\u2019t clamor for them in 2024. Aloe vera gels are also great at protecting the skin and retaining moisture. They\u2019re also naturally infused with minerals and antioxidants that help renew the skin, allowing consumers to maintain that beautiful summer skin.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s another reason consumers can\u2019t get enoughaloe vera gels.Women can use them as moisturizing gels without worrying about greasy residues on the skin. Unlike regular moisturizers, aloe vera gels will go the extra mile to soften the skin and unclog pores\u2014no wonder consumers love them!</p> \n<h2>How sellers can detect fake aloe vera gels</h2> \n<p>While popularity is not bad,aloe vera gelsare widespread enough to attract the attention of the fake product market. These counterfeit products may have the \u201caloe vera gel\u201d name but they can\u2019t replicate the real deal. So, sellers will easily detect them by following these tips.</p> \n<h3>The first ingredient is not Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, a quick look at the ingredients list is enough to spot something fake. In the case of aloe vera gels, businesses only have to find one ingredient:Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the most critical ingredient inaloe vera gels, meaning the leaf extract should be the first and main thing on the list. But if the list shows too many ingredients packed into the gel, it\u2019s not genuine. Such products don\u2019t have pure aloe vera gels, only a cocktail of other ingredients.</p> \n<h3>Pure aloe vera gel is not green</h3> \n<p>Color is another big giveaway for analoe vera gel\u2019spureness. Sellers must avoid anything bright green or completely transparent for these products as it\u2019s a big indicator that it\u2019s fake and likely packed with chemicals.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, purealoe vera gelshould be translucent gold or slightly yellow. Here\u2019s another tip: aloe vera gel color changes according to harvest time.</p> \n<p>If manufacturers harvest the gel during the monsoon season, it\u2019ll be clear in color (not completely transparent). But if the climate is warm and dry during harvest, the gels will have a yellow or golden hue.</p> \n<h3>The product smells sweet</h3> \n<p>If a sample smells sweet, that aloe vera gel likely contains artificial fragrances. Natural aloe vera gels have a garlicky and earthy scent, so sellers must look out for this little detail.</p> \n<p>In addition, some fake aloe vera gels may smell like alcohol. Experts recommend avoiding such products because they cause breakouts and dryness on the user\u2019s skin, leading to unsatisfied consumers and bad reviews.</p> \n<h3>The gel contains less than 15% aloe vera</h3> \n<p>Numbers don\u2019t lie, making them the surest way to detect false products. These gels should have at least 15 to 20% aloe vera extract. Anything lower than that won\u2019t help or provide any benefits.</p> \n<p>Some brands simply add aloe vera gel to their packaging. But it\u2019s probably fake if the aloe vera extract is listed at the end of the list or has the lowest percentage. Hence, always judge these products based on their ingredient list.</p> \n<h2>Points to remember when adding aloe vera gels to your inventory</h2> \n<h3>Making process</h3> \n<p>Thealoe vera gelconsumers use is not what manufacturers extract from the plant. They must convert it into a usable texture before anyone can reap their attractive benefits. Therefore, checking or inquiring about the manufacturer\u2019s making process is one way to ensure quality.</p> \n<p>An ideal process should start with extracting fresh aloe vera pulp or juice and blending it with emollients like glycerine to boost hydration properties. They can also use natural stabilizers to help oil and water-soluble ingredients maintain a gel form.</p> \n<p>Some manufacturers may add cellulose-based gelling agents to provide sticky textures, making these gels easier and more convenient. Turn away if the making process involves anything artificial.</p> \n<p>Aloe vera gels must be free of preservatives and pure\u2014this factor is non-negotiable! Don\u2019t forget this part when choosing these products.</p> \n<h3>Skin type compatibility</h3> \n<p>Aloe vera gelcontains 98% water, making it suitable for all skin types. However, these gels must be rich in vitamins A, C, E, and amino acids to provide tangible benefits.</p> \n<p>Aloe vera gels will be non-comedogenic with these potent antioxidants, making them perfect for oily skin. Don\u2019t forget they deliver a supreme burst of hydration, making them ideal for dry skin, too.</p> \n<p>Aloe vera gel can also help soothe sensitive skin. However, all these would be for naught if artificial ingredients were introduced into the formula. So, these gels must be free of preservatives and fragrances\u2014this factor is non-negotiable if businesses want to keep their high skin compatibility.</p> \n<h3>Shelf life</h3> \n<p>Herbalaloe vera gelscan last a good amount of time if manufacturers combine them with natural stabilizers. Since natural aloe vera gel has more water, it won\u2019t have a long shelf life.</p> \n<p>So, if target consumers need more shelf life, businesses can go for products with natural stabilizers that can last up to 2 years. But if they want something more natural, go for gels with minimal stabilizers (no preservatives!)</p> \n<p>Note: the less durability a product claims, the more natural it is.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Aloe vera gels are impressive and popular. Look at their Google data stats: these products rake in consistent 550,000 monthly searches, even in 2024, proving they\u2019re constantly in demand!</p> \n<p>But sellers must also be careful. Aloe vera gels are more sensitive than they look, so retailers must be cautious when adding them to their inventory.</p> \n<p>Before buying them in bulk, request samples and use the tips above to determine pureness. If it passes the quick test, consider the above mentioned factors to maximize profits from this market in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

However, tattoo machines come in two variants with unique properties.</p> \n<p>One can\u2019t say one machine is better than the other because each variant supports different techniques and offers different results. However, coiltattoo machinesmay be more stressful than their rotary cousins.</p> \n<h3>2. Needles</h3> \n<p>If tattoo machines are like the artist\u2019s hands,the needlesare the paintbrushes. Consumers need them to create lines, shades, and color fillings. Like paintbrushes, needles come in various types, but the general ones include turbo, shader, flat, round, and magnum.</p> \n<p>Somespecial typesare also available for more advanced tattoo artists.

Their simple designs also offer incredible nail trimming control and precision.</p> \n<h3>The electric nail clipper</h3> \n<p>Electric nail clippersget rid of the manual aspect of nail trimming. Instead, they use motorized designs to automate nail maintenance. Typically, they offer rotating blades, but some may come with grinding mechanisms to shape and trim nails effortlessly.</p> \n<h3>Guillotine nail clippers</h3> \n<p>These nail clippersare like lever-type models but feature guillotine-like mechanisms, as their name implies. Guillotine nail clippers have small holes where consumers put the nails they want to trim.</p> \n<p>Then, when consumers apply pressure, a blade will slide across to cut the nail cleanly. Although simple,guillotine clippersare famous for their cutting precision.</p> \n<h3>Scissors nail clippers</h3> \n<p>These nail clipperslook like regular scissors. They feature two blades with handles that users can control to cut nails skillfully. Hence, scissor nail clippers are the best for precise control and cutting technique versatility.</p> \n<h2>5 factors to consider before adding nail clippers to your inventory</h2> \n<h3>Nail type</h3> \n<p>Nails are not universal. Thickness and shape vary according to the consumer, and sellers must consider this nail variety when choosing nail clippers.</p> \n<p>For instance, consumers with thin or delicate nails will see scissors and classic clippers as the best option, while those with thicker nails or curved nail beds may be more suited for guillotine variants.</p> \n<p>And if consumers have difficult-to-cut nails, like those with ingrown nails or fungal infections, they\u2019ll need to invest in electric nail clippers.</p> \n<h3>Size (hand and nail)</h3> \n<p>Speaking more about nail variety, people also have different nail sizes, so manufacturers responded with various nail clipper sizes. If target consumers have smaller fingernails and toenails, they can get away with using regular fingernail clippers.</p> \n<p>However, if they have larger or thicker nails, they may need a set of finger and toenail clippers\u2014some cases may see consumers needing only toenail clippers. Toenail clippers are slightly larger than regular ones, giving more leverage to anyone with mobility issues.</p> \n<p>Hand size also matters here, as it determines how comfortable the tool will be to hold and use. Targets with larger hands may find it easy to control scissors and eclectic clippers, while guillotine clippers appeal to consumers with smaller hands.</p> \n<p>Note: Classic nail clippers are more universal since they\u2019re widely available.</p> \n<h3>Extra features</h3> \n<p>Clippers are generally divided into plain and feature-packed variants. Most nail clippers often have at least one extra feature to increase value. One of the most popular added features is nail files. Others include detachable blades, antimicrobial coatings, LED lights, and additional tools (like cuticle pushers and tweezers).</p> \n<h3>Edge shape</h3> \n<p>Traditional nail clippers offer two different edge shapes: curved and straight. Consumers who like rocking rounded nails will go for curved-edged clippers, while those who prefer more squared styles will stick with straight-edged models.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, if consumers are more susceptible to ingrown nails, experts recommend nail clippers with a straight edge.</p> \n<h3>Blade material</h3> \n<p>The best nail clippers come with stainless steel blades, the most popular material for these tools. Titanium steel is another popular alternative for nail clippers. Why do people love these blade materials?</p> \n<p>They are hypoallergenic, meaning almost anyone can use them without the risk of an allergic reaction. Plus, stainless steel and titanium-steel blades are rust-resistant and easy to clean, making avoiding infections and extending the clipper\u2019s life a breeze.</p> \n<h2>Last words</h2> \n<p>Nail grooming is an important part of keeping fingernails healthy. Nail clippers are one of the mostimportant toolsfor this purpose and one of the most popular. Currently, they\u2019ve attracted 90,500 searches in January 2024, showing there\u2019s a sizable audience sellers can cater to.</p> \n<p>But aside from choosing between the various types, sellers must also consider the tips highlighted in this article to gain a better understanding of selecting profitable nail clippers. So don\u2019t hesitate to add them to your inventory!</p> \n"}]}

These products are crucial to achieving the goal of blemish-free, glowing, and smooth looks, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re a staple in many beauty kits.</p> \n<p>Cleansing may be the first step in any beauty regimen, but facial cleansers don\u2019t offer a one-size-fits-all solution. For this reason, consumers look for them with various requirements in mind, meaning that sellers can\u2019t enter this market without some preparation.</p> \n<p>This article will highlight various factors businesses must understand to satisfy their target consumer\u2019s requirements for a range of cleansers to boost sales in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsFacial cleanser market overview6 key points to target when choosing facial cleansers in 2024Final words</p> \n<h2>Facial cleanser market overview</h2> \n<p>Thefacial cleanser markethas made great strides in recent years, growing to an impressive USD 2,15 billion value in 2023. However, experts say that value will readjust to USD 8.27 billion by 2030, expecting it to register a 5.41% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Since facial cleansers are a basic item for most women, experts predict the increasing population will propel market growth. The growing awareness of the importance of skincare and rising disposable incomes will also significantly impact the market over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>6 key points to target when choosing facial cleansers in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. The cleanser\u2019s formula</h3> \n<p>While allface cleansersremove dirt, excess oil, and makeup, they have different formulas offering varying results. The formula also determines how consumers use facial cleansers, so it\u2019s a non-negotiable consideration.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the different facial cleanser formulas and what they offer.</p> \n<h3>2. Cleansers for oily acne-prone skin</h3> \n<p>Since oily, acne-prone skin produces way more sebum than the skin can handle, it may be tempting to stock up on the harshest cleansers to help them get rid of everything. But the truth is such products only push the skin to replenish the lost oil by producing more.</p> \n<p>So, what\u2019s the best cleanser for oily, acne-prone skin? Businesses must prioritize products that will remove the excess oil without leaving the skin dehydrated. These cleaners should have lightweight formulas with high surfactant ratios and lower emollients.</p> \n<p>Based on this description, gel types are the cleansers most likely to attract oily-skinned women. They\u2019ll go for products containing mild ingredients like Salicylic Acid and tea tree oil to control their skin\u2019s oil production.</p> \n<h3>3. Cleansers for dry skin</h3> \n<p>Dry-skinned ladies are often very careful with their products. Generally, most cleansers are harsh for them, as they\u2019ll lose the small natural oil left on their faces after a cleansing session.</p> \n<p>For this reason, consumers with dry skin move toward gentle cleansers with moisturizing ingredients. They also love cleansers with fatty acids in oil form.</p> \n<p>Most women with dry skin understand that lather is not their friend. So, they\u2019ll prioritize cleansers with higher emollient percentages and lower surfactants\u2014that way, they can replenish any lost moisture!</p> \n<p>If these are the targets, retailers must look at creamy cleansers without exfoliators (salicylic or glycolic acid) notorious for drying out the skin. Instead, prioritize cleansing balms, creams, and oils with hydrating hyaluronic acid, Avocado oil, and Vitamins C/E.</p> \n<h3>4. Cleansers for combination skin</h3> \n<p>Combination skin requires more care and love than other skin types. In truth, women with combination skin often use two cleansers to handle their skin properly.</p> \n<p>Usually, they\u2019ll need one creamy cleanser packed with emollients for their dry patches and one gel variant with enough surfactants to activate ingredients like Salicylic Acid on their oily side.</p> \n<p>Combination-skinned consumers who prefer using one cleanser will choose a gel or creamy one that can easily handle oily areas without irritating dry patches.</p> \n<h3>5. Cleansers for normal skin</h3> \n<p>These consumers are the cream of the crop. Since their skin has no issues, they can use any cleanser they see, as long as it\u2019s not too harsh. They\u2019ll most likely avoid products that leave their skin tight.</p> \n<p>Women with normal skin only need cleansers to remove dirt and makeup. But if they have any concerns, they can find cleansers with ingredients to help address them.</p> \n<h3>6. Cleansers for mature skin</h3> \n<p>Mature skin means aging signs are running wild, pushing consumers toward cleansers rich in AHAs, retinoids, Vitamin A, and Vitamins C & E. These ingredients boost collagen production and kickstart cell turnover for smoother, glowing skin.</p> \n<p>These consumers also benefit from moisture retention. Hence, they\u2019ll lean towards mild cleansers that do the job without removing natural moisture.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Face cleansers play a critical role in beauty regimens. They\u2019re solely responsible for removing sebum, dirt, bacteria, sweat, dead cells, and other icky stuff women don\u2019t want on their faces during their skincare routine.</p> \n<p>But, since each skin type comes with unique requirements, sellers must prioritize products that will check all the boxes for their target consumers. Facial cleansers are incredibly popular, with over 550,000 searches in 2024. Hence, getting the right products is essential for profiting from the market\u2019s opportunities.</p> \n<p>Use the factors discussed in this article as a guide and watch the products fly off shelves when sales kick-off.</p> \n"}]}

Similarly, businesses must also take the time to curate their tattoo ink offers if they want to make any sales in this market.</p> \n<p>Luckily, this article will serve as a guide, showing sellers what they need to cross off their lists when stocking up on tattoo inks in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsTattoo ink: an overview of the 2024 marketUnderstanding tattoo ink safety regulations5 tips to help choose the perfect tattoo ink for eye-catching tattoosRounding up</p> \n<h2>Tattoo ink: an overview of the 2024 market</h2> \n<p>Theglobal tattoo marketaccumulated a US $233.10 million value in 2022. However, experts predict the market will reach US $335.96 million by 2029 at a 4.36% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). They also expect tattoo ink usage will rise significantly globally as more people get tattoos.</p> \n<p>According to reports, global tattoo ink usage has boosted by 5.46% in the past five years, from 376.44 MT (metric tons) in 2012 to 465.6 MT in 2022. Based on type, black and gray tattoo inks had the highest consumption rate in 2022 (309.42 MT).</p> \n<p>The 18\u201325 age group also dominated the end-user segment, as young people are most likely to get tattoos. Europe and America emerged as the top tattoo-ink-consuming regions, with Italy having the highest tattooed population (48%), Sweden (47%), and the USA (46%), respectively, coming in second and third.</p> \n<h2>Understanding tattoo ink safety regulations</h2> \n<p>Tattoos should be a safe (albeit painful) way for people to express themselves and enjoy body art, so it\u2019s no surprise that tattoo inks have strict safety regulations. For example, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) pushed some regulations that required tattoo ink manufacturers to stop using some original ingredients for safer products.</p> \n<p>Now, most of these manufacturers opt for ingredients that meetREACH standards. Likewise, the FDA performs similar roles in the American market, helping to keep tattoo inks safe for consumption.</p> \n<p>Now, tattoo inks go through stringent testing to ensure regulatory compliance. Hence, businesses must ensure the inks they purchase meet the safety regulations of their target regional market.</p> \n<h2>5 tips to help choose the perfect tattoo ink for eye-catching tattoos</h2> \n<h3>1. Know the properties of each available color</h3> \n<p>Tattoo ink colorsare not as simple as the ones used for painting. Each hue comes with different properties that make it stand out. Some tattoo artists may even prefer certain colors over others, so sellers shouldn\u2019t just pack all the colors they can find.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a detailed overview of all the available tattoo ink colors and their properties:</p> \n<h3>2. Examine the pigment quality and concentration</h3> \n<p>Tattoo inkscontain pigments that help define their quality. These pigments are the secret behind creating beautiful and long-lasting body art, so choosing the best inks means opting for high-quality pigments.</p> \n<p>Tattoo inks made from high-quality pigments offer more stability, regardless of the environmental factors (moisture, UV light, or others). For this reason,high-quality pigmentshave more fade resistance, allowing clients to enjoy their tattoo\u2019s brilliance when it\u2019s fresh and when it heals.</p> \n<p>But high-quality pigments are not the only aspect determining the best tattoo inks. Concentration also plays a big role. Inks with higher pigment concentrations offer even coverage and more vibrant results.</p> \n<h3>3. Don\u2019t forget consistency and flow rate</h3> \n<p>Tattoo inksalso offer different consistencies, determining how thick or thin they will be. This consistency also defines their flow rate. For example, thicker inks may be tricky to put into the client\u2019s skin, while thinner ones may be too runny to work with.</p> \n<p>Many tattoo artists love a comfortable medium between thick and thin. But even this \u201csweet spot\u201d varies among tattoo artists, with some preferring slightly thicker or thinnermedium consistencies.</p> \n<p>But what determinestattoo inkconsistency? The formula\u2019s carrier ingredients have the largest influence on this aspect as they move the pigment into the skin. Common carriers include hazel, alcohol, and glycerin.</p> \n<h3>4. Compatibility with different skin types is a must</h3> \n<p>While pigments are undoubtedly important, they\u2019re not the only ingredients to watch out for.Tattoo inksalso contain additives and other ingredients, and businesses must opt for safe, pure, and natural ones.</p> \n<p>It\u2019ll help reduce the chances of allergic reactions or other tattoo complications.</p> \n<h3>5. Choose between pre-dispersed and stable pigments</h3> \n<p>Businesses must also choose between pre-dispersed and stable pigments when choosingtattoo inks. Pre-dispersed pigments are pretty popular today because of how convenient they are to use.</p> \n<p>Pre-dispersedtattoo inkscome with a predetermined pigment-to-carrier solvent ratio, so consumers don\u2019t have to do extra mixing or thinning\u2014they\u2019re shake-and-use inks! Such tattoo inks are the best for beginner tattoo artists.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,stable pigmentsneed careful mixing and blending before usage. Hence, they\u2019re ideal for advanced and highly experienced tattoo artists.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>As more people become willing toget tattoos, it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019ll want ones that\u2019ll look amazing for years (with proper care, of course!).

But one that\u2019s currently making the rounds and catching everybody\u2019s attention is the dewy, radiant look. In truth, the fresh-faced, shiny look has quickly become a staple, pushing many people to find ways to recreate it.</p> \n<p>So, how can sellers benefit from this sought-after aesthetic? By selling the right products, of course! Bronzers and highlighters are two major products that make achieving this runway-worthy look possible for regular folks.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s everything businesses need to know about bronzers and highlighters before investing in them in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the global bronzer and highlighter marketsEverything to know about bronzersEverything to know about highlightersIn conclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global bronzer and highlighter markets</h2> \n<p>Bronzers and highlighters are huge makeup industry segments, so they have different market sizes. According to experts, the global face bronzer market registered US $16.20 billion in revenue in 2022. They also expect it to experience more growth from 2024 to 2028 at a 7.25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>On the other hand, research shows theface highlighter marketincreased to US $15.9 billion in 2022, with experts saying it will reach US $25.15 billion by FY 2030 at a 5.9% CAGR.</p> \n<p>The market drivers propelling growth for both segments include increasing demand for cosmetic products, shifting beauty standards, and social media and beauty influencers emphasizing a sun-kissed complexion.</p> \n<p>Here are other important stats:</p> \n<h2>Everything to know about bronzers</h2> \n<p>Bronzersare the go-to products for adding depth and dimension to makeup looks. They offer warmer undertones and can easily give anyone a sun-kissed look.</p> \n<p>Bronzersalso add shades and shadows, helping to create a more chiseled and slimmer look. And they are great for adding a summery glow to consumers\u2019 faces!</p> \n<h3>Types of bronzers to stock</h3> \n<p>These bronzers did not start out as the easiest to use. Consumers often find them difficult to blend, making many people avoid using them. However, that\u2019s a case of the past.</p> \n<p>In addition to improved packing and shade variety, manufacturers now offer thin formulas that apply flawlessly to the skin. Recentcream bronzersoffer softer, sheerer finishes that make them look more natural after blending.</p> \n<p>Liquid bronzershave runnier formulas than creams\u2014usually packaged in tubes or droppers. In contrast to matte and shiny creams, liquid bronzers are perfect for adding shimmery or radiant effects that make the user\u2019s skin extra glowy.</p> \n<p>Powder bronzers are the most popular (and most common) option available. They\u2019ve been a great choice for years, and for good reason.These bronzersare the easiest to blend once consumers get the right shade.</p> \n<p>Although powder bronzers contain more pigment than other types, their blendability makes them ideal for beginners.</p> \n<h3>What to consider when choosing bronzers</h3> \n<p>The first step to choosing the best bronzer for target consumers is matching its color with their skin\u2019s undertones. Consumers can have any of the three skin undertones below\u2014check them out to know the perfect bronzer color to stock up on.</p> \n<p>After determining the target undertone, next is finding out how light or deep consumers will want to go with their bronzers. What determines that is their skin tone. Generally, skin tones fall into four categories: fair, light, medium, or deep.</p> \n<h2>Everything to know about highlighters</h2> \n<p>Highlightersare the key to achieving the sought-after lit-from-within glow. The best part about highlighters is that they reflect light. So many consumers apply them on the highest points of their faces or use them on areas where they want to stand out more.</p> \n<h3>Types of highlighter to purchase</h3> \n<p>These highlightersare an easy way to get the trendy \u201cglow-from-within\u201d aesthetic. However, using too much may look too bright (blinding even). But thankfully, consumers can mix a drop or two with moisturizers for a seamless blend.</p> \n<p>Stick highlightersare even easier to use than liquid variants. They\u2019re also more precise since they focus only on important facial areas.</p> \n<p>These highlighters are also the go-to for reaching those difficult-to-reach areas of the face, like under the brow bones or the eye\u2019s inner corners. Although they require a little blending, stick highlighters remain the most travel-friendly option.</p> \n<p>These highlightersare like shimmery versions of compact powders.Powder highlightersare not pigmented like their liquid counterparts and come in pressed forms. Consumers only need a fan brush stroke to add dimension and make their faces glisten with this product.</p> \n<h3>What to consider when choosing highlighters</h3> \n<p>Like bronzers, how good highlighters look depends on the consumer\u2019s skin undertone. Consumers with warmer (more yellow) undertones, from tan to fair, look their best in champagne and gold highlighters.</p> \n<p>Similarly, those with neutral and cooler undertones from medium to fair will buy more silver, pearl, and rose gold highlighters.</p> \n<p>The best highlighters are two times lighter than the user\u2019s skin tone. Why? Sticking to more lightweight highlighters will create a more natural-looking glow and help prevent makeup from looking harsh or distracting.</p> \n<p>Consumers with medium skin can use golden or bronze highlighters, while those with deep skin will prefer copper or bronzer highlighters.</p> \n<p>Do consumers want a more natural glow? Offer them formulas with thinner, creamier textures and subtle shimmer. But if consumers want to go full glam, businesses must look for highlighters with a duo-chrome effect, like sheen combined with shades of pink, green, lavender, and aqua blue.</p> \n<p>Ladies with textured skin (dry, acne-prone, or larger pores) will see better effects with cream or liquid formulas. Powder highlighters may make textured skin look rougher, but creams or liquids will melt into the skin for more seamless applications.</p> \n<p>Women with less-textured skin can use powder highlighters just fine\u2014especially if they also have excess sebum.</p> \n<h2>In conclusion</h2> \n<p>Bronzers and highlighters may be different products, but they form a great team when creating an amazing, dewy, glowy look. So, consumers need both products to get the dream look that is making the rounds on social media.</p> \n<p>Businesses can sell these productsin setswith a blush or market them individually. But before that, they must determine their target audience and consider their skin undertone, tone, type, desired effect, and texture before buying these beauty products in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Here are some benefits that make these products so popular:</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s the market for setting sprays like in 2024?</h2> \n<p>In 2023, experts valued thesetting spray marketat US $966.4 million. However, they say the market will expand from US $1.04 billion in 2024 to US $1.73 billion by 2030, growing at a 7.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The market is experiencing increased demand due to the rising desire for long-lasting, smudge-proof makeup. Consumers are also looking for ways to keep their makeup fresh and flawless, regardless of environmental factors, which research predicts will boost market demand.</p> \n<p>Here are other vital stats:</p> \n<h2>5 tips to consider when adding makeup setting sprays to your inventory</h2> \n<h3>1. Face mists are not setting sprays</h3> \n<p>Some suppliers may market face mists assetting sprays. Don\u2019t fall for it. A typical face mist contains ingredients like water, green tea, chamomile, vitamins, and minerals\u2014no ingredients listed will help lock makeup.</p> \n<p>While such products are great as hydrating mists for dry skin and refreshment, they offer nothing to keep foundations mattified or extend makeup wear time. In the same vein, illuminating and glow mists won\u2019t increase makeup wear time but will decrease it with moisturizing agents.</p> \n<p>Actualmakeup spraysshould contain various film-forming agents, like polymers or silicone derivatives. These are responsible for creating the film that locks makeup in place. If this ingredient is not present, the product is likely a dud.</p> \n<h3>2. Prioritize setting sprays containing alcohol</h3> \n<p>As previously implied, not allmakeup sprayswill do what consumers expect. The easiest way to tell a pretender from the real one is by checking the ingredient list for alcohol. It should be present first or second if it\u2019s the main ingredient.</p> \n<p>Alcohol-containingsetting sprayscreate an effect similar to hair sprays, adding quick-dry properties that feel tight on the skin. In other words, alcohol helps make the makeup last longer.</p> \n<p>However, businesses can explore alcohol-free alternatives only if their target consumers have sensitive skin. In theory, alcohol-free variants, like mineral setting spray, will work as well as their alcohol-containing counterparts.</p> \n<h3>3. Understand the different skin type requirements</h3> \n<p>Beauty products now consider different skin requirements, andmakeup-setting spraysare no exception. The target consumer\u2019s skin type will determine the setting spray they need for the best experience.</p> \n<p>Consumers with oily skin will search for settingspray formulaswith matte finishes and oil-controlling ingredients, while those with dry skin will shift towards variants with hydrating benefits. Lastly, sensitive-skinned consumers will avoid any spray with irritants like fragrances and alcohol.</p> \n<h3>4. Know the consumer\u2019s preferred finish</h3> \n<p>Setting sprayalso has some variety in finishes. These products offer up to four different finishes, each compatible with varying skin types. Here\u2019s a closer look at each of them:</p> \n<h3>5. Find out how long consumers want it to last</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers always add estimated hours of wear to their products so consumers know how longthe sprayswill hold their makeup. If target consumers care more about longevity, sellers must prioritize products that emphasize staying power.</p> \n<p>If consumers don\u2019t care about longevity, they may want to save some money on setting sprays that don\u2019t boast 24 hours of wear. Waterproofing is another aspect contributing to a makeup setting spray\u2019s longevity.</p> \n<p>Waterproofsetting sprayscan resist heat, sweat, and water, helping makeup to withstand the elements (no matter how harsh). They are great for sweat-intensive activities (like gyming) or beach/ or pool days. Since not all setting sprays are waterproof, sellers must search for them if their consumers want extra security.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Ladies spend a lot of time crafting the perfect makeup look. So, watching it melt away before they want to remove it could ruin their day. That\u2019s why makeup setting sprays are an important part of anybeauty kit.</p> \n<p>Setting sprays have also gotten a boost in attention this year. Search interest increased by 100%, from 90,500 in 2023 to 201,000 in January 2024. So, now\u2019s the perfect time to jump on this product trend.</p> \n<p>But, before that, sellers must leverage the tips discussed in this article to choose effective makeup sprays and keep consumers returning for more in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Likewise, the European tattoo gun market will experience significant growth over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>Types of tattoo guns</h2> \n<p>Here\u2019s some interesting history about tattoo guns. The earliest tattoo guns came from Thomas Edison\u2019s electric pen, created for something entirely different. But Sam O\u2019Reilly took that idea in 1851 and patented the first ink-and-tube system rotary tattoo machine.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, tattoo guns have enjoyed immense technological advancements since the 1800s, allowing the following types to enter the market:</p> \n<h3>Coil tattoo guns</h3> \n<p>Thesetattoo gunswere once the industry standard, with many tattoo artists tagging them as the \u201cbest tattoo machine.\u201d Coil tattoo guns were highly favored due to their user-friendly electromagnetic design, relatively low cost, and easily interchangeable parts.</p> \n<p>Coil tattoo gunscan also handle different tattoo needles for shading or lining.

Generally, machines can either have short, medium, or long strokes.</p> \n<p>The tattoo style also determines the kind of stroke consumers need. More realistic (i.e., black and gray) tattoos require three-millimeter strokes, while those with big line work or colors must use four-millimeter variants.</p> \n<h3>Comfort</h3> \n<p>Comfort is another essential factor to consider when choosing tattoo guns. A comfortable machine means better tattoos and lower injury risks. Here are some things to watch out for when selecting comfortable tattoo guns to sell.</p> \n<h3>Material and weight</h3> \n<p>The last thing artists want is their tattoo guns breaking mid-session and damaging their clients\u2019 skin.

But things can quickly go south if tattoo artists don\u2019t have the right supplies. So, to make their offers more enticing, businesses can offer tattoo guns with a few essential accessories like grips, needle cartridges, and tattoo needles.</p> \n<p>Whether businesses want to offer tattoo guns in sets or standalone, remember to leverage the factors discussed in this article to choose the best machines for target consumers.

Even for customers without acne-prone skin, around 80% of people are affected by pimples during their lifetime. When an acne breakout occurs, customers seek remedies to treat their skin. Pimple patches are a good option for your customers to get rid of stubborn pimples.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are pimple patches?How pimple patches are usedBenefits of pimple patchesDrawbacks of pimple patchesTypes of pimple patchesConclusion</p> \n<h2>What are pimple patches?</h2> \n<p>Pimple patches, or acne patches, are a relatively newer treatment for acne that has grown in popularity. In the past year, interest in pimple patches has grown by 81%, with 86,000 searches per month.</p> \n<p>Pimple patches are one-time-useadhesive stickersthat are put directly on pimples. The pimple patches work by absorbing the gunk from the pimple, such as pus, discharge, oil, and dirt. Additionally, pimple patches speed up the healing process.</p> \n<h2>How pimple patches are used</h2> \n<p>For best results, customers should wear pimple patches for at least several hours, preferably 6\u20138 hours. Customers can wear the pimple patches during the day and apply makeup on top of the stickers. Additionally, customers can also wear pimple patches at night before going to sleep.</p> \n<p>Your customers will use the pimple during their skincare routine. They will first need to clean their face with a cleanser before applying a pimple patch. Furthermore, they must ensure their face is dry before applying the pimple patch. Otherwise, the sticker may not stick and fall off their skin.</p> \n<p>After applying the pimple patch, your customers will resume the rest of their skincare routine, including applying a toner, serum, and moisturizer. Also, pimple patches are waterproof, and your customers can take a shower while wearing the pimple patch.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of pimple patches</h2> \n<p>Pimple patches are an effective treatment for pimples that are ready to pop because pimple patches absorb discharge and heal the pimple. There are numerous other benefits that customers can experience with pimple patches.</p> \n<p>Unclogs pores:Pimple patches are a fantastic treatment for whiteheads. Whiteheads are pores clogged with oil, dead skin cells, impurities, or bacteria, and a white bump appears on the skin. Customers with whiteheads can use pimple patches to unclog their pores and reduce the appearance of whiteheads. Blackheads are similar to whiteheads, but blackheads leave a black spot on the skin. Pimple patches will generally not pull out the blackheads, but the pimple patches will help absorb excess oil and unclog pores.</p> \n<p>Speeds up the healing process:When customers touch pimples on their skin, they are getting bacteria from their hands on their face, which can slow the healing process of the pimple. Pimple patches ensure that customers will not touch or pick at the pimple, and they will not be getting bacteria or dirt from their hands on their faces. Furthermore, pimple patches absorb the discharge from pimples and allow the pimples to heal faster.</p> \n<p>Reduces risk of scarring:Another consequence of customers picking and popping pimples on their faces is that the pimples can cause inflammation andacne scarring. By using pimple patches, customers will not pick at their pimples, and the pimples will heal faster. In turn, the quicker healing process reduces the risk of scarring.</p> \n<h2>Drawbacks of pimple patches</h2> \n<p>Pimple patches are skin-safe andwill not make acne worse. However, there are different types of acne and skin types for which pimple patches are not as effective or recommended.</p> \n<p>Blind pimples:Blind pimples are blemishes underneath the skin surface that do not have a whitehead or blackhead. Pimple patches are generally not effective for blind pimples because pimple patches treat pimples and whiteheads that are at the skin surface.</p> \n<p>Cystic acne:Likewise, pimple patches are ineffective for customers with cystic acne because cystic pimples are deeper in the skin. Regular pimple patches only treat surface-level pimples.</p> \n<p>Sensitive skin:The adhesive from the sticker of the pimple patch can irritate the face of customers with sensitive skin. Furthermore, some ingredients used in pimple patches, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil, can cause dry skin and skin inflammation and leave a temporary red mark on the face.</p> \n<h2>Types of pimple patches</h2> \n<p>There are different types ofpimple patchesthat can be used to treat pimples or zits.</p> \n<p>Hydrocolloid:Hydrocolloid pimple patchesare the most common form of pimple patches. Hydrocolloid was originally used to heal wounds, and today, it is also used to treat pimples. The hydrocolloid patches contain a gel that moistens the area around the pimple, absorbs the drainage, and reduces the size and redness of the pimple. When customers use hydrocolloid pimple patches, the sticker will turn white as the patch absorbs the fluid from the pimple. Hydrocolloid pimple patches are a fantastic option for customers who want to get rid of their pimples.</p> \n<p>Salicylic acid:Salicylic acid is an active ingredient added to some pimple patches to exfoliate the skin gently. Salicylic acid unclogs pores, absorbs excess oil, and heals pimples, making it a good option for customers with whiteheads and blackheads.</p> \n<p>Benzoyl peroxide:Benzoyl peroxide is another ingredient occasionally added to pimple patches. Benzoyl peroxide is used to reduce acne breakouts and bacteria on the skin. Pimple patches with benzoyl peroxide are a great option for customers with acne-prone skin.</p> \n<p>Microneedling:Regular pimple patches do not treat pimples underneath the skin surface. However, there are pimple patches with tiny spikes or microneedles that go deeper into the skin to absorb the fluid. Microneedle pimple patches are a good choice for customers with blind pimples that are underneath the skin surface.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>A majority of your customers can get pimples at some point in their lives, and pimple patches are a popular treatment for getting clearer-looking skin. Pimple patches unclog pores, speed up the healing process, and reduce scarring, making it an effective treatment for customers with pimples oracne-prone skin.</p> \n"}]}

These ingredients, once the heroes of our kitchens, are now emerging as the champions of our skincare routines, promising not just superficial beauty enhancements but profound health benefits as well.</p> \n<p>The global natural beauty market, with its steady growth trajectory since 2018, illustrates a broader consumer shift toward products that marry aesthetic appeal with health and wellness benefits. Predictions indicate a leap from $13.87 billion in revenue in 2024 to $18.01 billion in 2028, signaling a robust and expanding interest in natural beauty solutions that are deeply intertwined with the Mediterranean lifestyle. This dietary pattern, renowned for its rich, antioxidant-laden ingredients, has seen a 57% increase in global Google searches over the last year, underscoring its rising popularity and influence beyond the culinary world and into the realms of beauty and skincare.</p> \n<h2>Key drivers behind the trend</h2> \n<p>Several pivotal forces are propelling the Mediterranean ingredient trend forward in the beauty industry. First, there\u2019s a growing consumer pursuit of \u201clongevity ingredients\u201d as the new frontier in anti-aging skincare. This shift sees beauty consumers across generations gravitating towards ingredients that not only promise to slow the signs of aging but also prioritize the health and resilience of the skin over time. The Mediterranean diet, with its cornerstone ingredients like Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), tomatoes, and lemons, offers a treasure trove of such elements, rich in antioxidants and natural acids that support skin health and longevity.</p> \n<p>Moreover, sustainability and ethical considerations are becoming increasingly important to consumers, who now seek out products that align with their values. The \u201cPreservationists,\u201d a consumer persona identified within the trend, prioritize sustainability, ethics, and the support of small-batch, seasonal, and locally made beauty products. This aligns perfectly with the ethos of the Mediterranean lifestyle, which emphasizes natural, sustainable, and ethically sourced ingredients.</p> \n<p>The concept of regenerative farming and its promise of sustainable alternatives for brands and ingredient suppliers is another key driver. This approach not only ensures the availability of more potent and nutrient-rich products but also appeals to consumers\u2019 growing environmental consciousness.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the organic beauty boom, underscored by a rising demand for organic claims and the critical role of certifications in substantiating these claims, further fuels the trend. The UK\u2019s Soil Association, for example, certified 22% more products in 2022 than in the previous year, indicating a strong and growing preference for organically certified beauty solutions.</p> \n<p>Lastly, the educational content surge on platforms like TikTok, highlighting the Mediterranean diet\u2019s skin benefits, plays a significant role in spreading awareness.</p> \n<p>This digital advocacy has contributed to the Mediterranean diet being named the \u2018world\u2019s healthiest\u2019 for six consecutive years, bringing the spotlight not just on the diet itself but on the potent beauty benefits of its key ingredients.</p> \n<p>By tapping into these drivers, the beauty industry is not merely adopting a set of ingredients; it\u2019s embracing a comprehensive lifestyle approach that values health, sustainability, and the authentic storytelling of Mediterranean traditions. This profound integration of Mediterranean diet-derived ingredients into beauty products not only caters to the current market demands but sets a new standard for what consumers expect from their skincare and beauty routines.</p> \n<h2>Mediterranean stars: Ingredients making waves</h2> \n<p>Exploring the key ingredients, Extra Virgin Olive Oil stands out for its antioxidant properties, alongside artichokes and quinoa, known for their skin-supporting benefits.</p> \n<p>Beyond the plant-based ingredients, dairy products like yogurts offer microbiome-boosting effects, with Korres\u2019 Greek Yogurt range exemplifying this. The spotlight on these ingredients highlights a demand for products that offer deeper, more meaningful benefits than conventional beauty solutions.</p> \n<h2>Sustainability and sourcing: The heart of Mediterranean beauty</h2> \n<p>Sustainable sourcing practices are crucial in this trend, with a focus on regenerative farming to ensure ingredient potency and environmental stewardship. Transparency in the supply chain and collaborations with Mediterranean farmers are becoming key factors in brand differentiation. This emphasis on sustainability caters to consumer demand and contributes to a more responsible beauty industry.</p> \n<h3>Action points for embracing the Mediterranean trend</h3> \n<p>For brands looking to incorporate Mediterranean diet-derived ingredients into their offerings, several strategies emerge. These include sourcing responsibly, leveraging the concept of \u201cgourmet beauty,\u201d extending the trend to haircare, and innovating with scents inspired by Mediterranean cuisine. These action points offer a roadmap for brands aiming to capture the essence of the Mediterranean in their products, ensuring alignment with consumer expectations and values.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The intersection of the Mediterranean diet and beauty signifies a pivotal moment in the industry, blending tradition with modern aspirations for health, sustainability, and beauty. As we look towards 2025, it\u2019s clear that these ingredients not only offer a bridge to a healthier lifestyle but also represent a broader shift in consumer values and expectations. Embracing this trend is not just about adding new ingredients to a product lineup; it\u2019s about connecting with a global narrative that values authenticity, health, and the environment.</p> \n"}]}

The dislike for such routines even extends to using brow pencils, gel, pomades, and soap combos daily for theperfect brow.</p> \n<p>While some women certainly don\u2019t mind the brow beauty routine, others who can\u2019t handle the stress turn to semi-permanent solutions like microblading. And it\u2019s a very popular procedure, too, raking in 673,000 searches monthly.</p> \n<p>This article shows sellers five must-have microblading tools to maximize profits from this market. But first, here\u2019s the basics of microblading and why it\u2019s so popular.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsUnderstanding the basics of microbladingWhat will the market be like in 2024?5 necessary tools estheticians need in a microblading kitLeverage these tools</p> \n<h2>Understanding the basics of microblading</h2> \n<p>Microblading is basically cosmetic tattooing. However, it\u2019s quite different from traditional tattoos because the esthetician uses a blade-shaped tool with rows of microneedles instead of a tattoo gun. This tool creates hair-like strokes along the brows while adding pigment to the skin.</p> \n<p>The results are a realistic-looking brow that won\u2019t wash off for a long time (typically a year or more). Since they only last for a long time, microblading tattoos are only semi-permanent, with an easy and almost painless healing process.</p> \n<p>However, not every female consumer is a great candidate for microblading. So, sellers must understand their target market, as skin type helps determine if a client is suitable for this cosmetic procedure or not.</p> \n<p>For instance, if they have keratosis pilaris on their forehead or frequently deal with cystic acne or breakouts around the brow area, then such consumers can\u2019t enjoy microblading.</p> \n<p>Note: Other conditions like sensitive skin, allergy-prone consumers, and pregnant or breastfeeding clients may also fall short of being eligible for microblading procedures.</p> \n<h2>What will the market be like in 2024?</h2> \n<p>Experts predict theglobal microblading marketwill reach US $4.2 billion by 2025, moving from US $2.4 billion in 2019 at a 10.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The market\u2019s growth drivers include the rising awareness of microblading benefits and the increasing popularity of cosmetic procedures among young women.</p> \n<p>Although the microblading market is in its early development stages, the procedure has enjoyed a popularity boost as more women seek easy ways to achieve the perfect brows. The market is also highly fragmented, with many small-scale players dominating the market (the top 10 players account for less than 30% of the overall market).</p> \n<p>Research also suggests Asia-Pacific will register the fastest CAGR over the forecast period. Experts expect the North American microblading market to grow at an impressive rate during the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>5 necessary tools estheticians need in a microblading kit</h2> \n<h3>1. Microblading pigment</h3> \n<p>While traditional tattoos use concentrated inks, microblading rolls with smaller pigment particles create a soft, subtle, semi-permanent look.Microblading pigmentscan generally be categorized as either organic or inorganic.</p> \n<p>Organicmicroblading pigmentsare usually fruit- or vegetable-based, with many giving them the nickname \u201clake pigments.\u201d They offer rich brow colors and brighter effects that eliminate a dull, faded look. Organic pigments are also oil-dispersible, meaning the colors blend more naturally with the client\u2019s skin and have little to no clumping.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, inorganic pigments consist of iron oxide, preservatives, perfumes, and other additives. While it\u2019s more affordable than organic ink, it has a higher risk of causing reactions or permanent damage.</p> \n<p>Inorganic pigmentsare lighter than organic ones, offering less intense colors. While they provide a non-transparent solid color, it can change over time due to the high iron content (some consumers may end up with \u201cpink brows\u201d).</p> \n<h3>2. Microblading blades</h3> \n<p>Many people love microblading because it\u2019s customizable.Microblading bladesare one of the tools that bring this customizability to reality. Since everyone has unique skin thickness and features, it makes sense that different blades exist for various clients.</p> \n<p>But first, what aremicroblading blades? They\u2019re one of the primary tools, consisting of small, sharp needles that make the frame and form of a blade. Depending on the type of microblade, the needles can come in different shapes, one or more rows, or with narrow or wide spacings.</p> \n<p>Check out the table below for the two types of microblades:</p> \n<p>Microneedling bladescan also be divided into shapes:</p> \n<h3>3. Pigment mixer machine</h3> \n<p>While regular pigments (like black) work for most situations, some clients may want custom shades for their brows. That\u2019s wherepigment mixer machinescome in. They\u2019re the perfect tool to help estheticians mix various pigments to get their clients\u2019 desired color.</p> \n<p>The best part is thatpigment mixer machinesare easy to use, meaning consumers can easily create a wide range of custom colors without any hassle. These tools ensure estheticians get a nicely blended, homogenous pigment mix whenever they need to make a custom shade.</p> \n<h3>4. Mapping tools</h3> \n<p>Microblading needs some craftsmanship to make the perfect look, making mapping a crucial part of the process. And consumers will need the perfect tool to help them map theideal brow shapefor their clients.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, businesses can offervarious toolsfor mapping. However, some may be more complex, so keep the target consumer in mind before stocking up.</p> \n<p>Whilecalipersare perfect for beginners and novice microblading artists, compasses will do more heavy lifting once they master the tool.</p> \n<h3>5. Marking tools</h3> \n<p>Mapping toolsmay help get the shape, but it\u2019ll mean nothing if artists can mark them. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll need marking tools to help draw the ideal brow shape before the procedure.</p> \n<p>Marking tools are an absolute must-have because they visualize the shape of the client\u2019s future brows. Some artists prefer using pencils as theirmarking tool, while others opt for markers\u2014none is more effective than the other, so it depends more on preference.</p> \n<p>However, ensure the marking tool has enough precision and leaves long-lasting marks without smudges.</p> \n<h2>Leverage these tools</h2> \n<p>Microblading is a great way to enjoy a semi-permanent brow job for years without needing pesky beauty routines. However, microblading is not a DIY process. Hence, businesses must avoid labeling their offers for at-home use.</p> \n<p>The target audience should be licensed professionals with the necessary certificates to carry out these procedures. Estheticians must have the right equipment before starting a microblading business, and sellers can profit from that need.</p> \n<p>Invest in microblading pigments, microblading blades, pigment mixer machines, mapping tools, and marking tools to leverage this cosmetic tattoo market in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

After delving deep into the subject, it\u2019s evident that clean beauty is here to stay, setting thegold standard for modern skin health.Let\u2019s explore why nature is becoming the norm.</p> \n<h2>Key Insights</h2> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe Rise of Clean BeautyCore Elements of Clean BeautyWhy Clean Beauty Matters</p> \n<h3>The Rise of Clean Beauty</h3> \n<p>The clean beauty revolution is gaining traction as younger generations prioritize skincare, seeking healthier alternatives to traditional beauty products.</p> \n<p>The shift towards clean beauty among the youth is a reflection of a larger trend towards sustainability and environmental consciousness. This movement is not just about avoiding harmful chemicals, but also about embracing ethical practices and sustainable sourcing. Social media influencers play a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, and their discussions around green beauty have helped to raise awareness and drive demand for clean beauty products.</p> \n<p>Clean beauty brands are responding to this demand by offering products that are not only safe for the skin but also kind to the planet. These products often come with certifications that assure consumers of their organic, cruelty-free, or vegan credentials. The focus is on transparency and honesty, with brands being open about their ingredients and production processes.</p> \n<p>As the clean beauty trend continues to grow, we can expect to see more innovation in this space, with brands developing new formulations that are both effective and environmentally friendly. This shift towards clean beauty is a positive step towards a more sustainable and conscious approach to personal care.</p> \n<p>The beauty industry is indeed undergoing a significant transformation, with skincare and clean beauty taking center stage. This shift is driven by a more informed and health-conscious consumer base, particularly among younger demographics. They are not just looking for products that enhance their appearance, but also those that are beneficial for their overall health and well-being.</p> \n<p>Natural ingredients and authenticity have become key factors in the decision-making process for these consumers. They are seeking products that are free from harmful chemicals and synthetic additives, preferring instead those that are derived from natural sources. This demand for natural ingredients is not just limited to skincare, but extends to makeup, haircare, and other personal care products as well.</p> \n<p>Transparency from brands has become a crucial aspect of consumer trust.

The demand for these products stems from a growing awareness among consumers about the impact of ingredients on their skin and overall health. Gluten-free products are particularly important for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies. For these consumers, using gluten-free beauty products is not just a preference but a necessity to avoid allergic reactions or skin irritations. Brands that offer gluten-free options are catering to this specific need, ensuring that their products are safe and suitable for everyone.</p> \n<p>Organic products, on the other hand, appeal to consumers who are concerned about the environmental impact of their beauty products. Organic certification ensures that the ingredients used in these products are grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, which can be harmful to both the environment and human health. Consumers who choose organic beauty products are often seeking a more natural and sustainable approach to their skincare routine. Both gluten-free and organic products align with the clean beauty movement\u2019s emphasis on transparency, health, and sustainability. By choosing these products, consumers are making a conscious decision to prioritize their well-being and the well-being of the planet.</p> \n<p>Clean beauty products often carry natural and hypoallergenic claims. Natural products utilize ingredients derived from nature, such as plants and minerals. Hypoallergenic products are formulated to minimize allergic reactions. Consumers prefer these products as they are gentle on the skin and contribute to maintaining healthy skin.</p> \n<p>Understanding the science and regulation behind clean beauty is crucial. Clean beauty promotes the use of natural and organic ingredients in skincare products. Backed by scientific research and regulations, these products ensure safety and effectiveness, aiding consumers in making informed choices.</p> \n<h3>Why Clean Beauty Matters</h3> \n<p>Clean beauty is significant due to the increasing consumer consciousness and knowledge about product ingredients. Consumers prefer clean cosmetics that are free from harmful chemicals and toxins.</p> \n<p>Consumers are becoming more aware of the products they purchase, including beauty and personal care items. With access to information and increased knowledge about product ingredients, consumers are choosing products that align with their values of sustainability, authenticity, and naturalness.</p> \n<p>Understanding the ingredients in beauty products is important. Consumers wish to be informed about what they apply on their skin and its impact on their health. This knowledge empowers consumers to make better choices for their personal care routines, enhancing their services and client experiences.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The clean beauty trend continues to gain momentum, particularly among the younger generation. With increasing consumer consciousness and knowledge about product ingredients, there is a growing demand for clean cosmetics that are gluten-free, organic, and hypoallergenic. This movement is supported by science and regulation, ensuring the safety and authenticity of these products.</p> \n"}]}

As consumers navigate their busy lives, they demand skincare solutions that not only cater to their specific needs but also align with their values of time-saving convenience and holistic health. Enter the era of innovative cleansing products: from hybrid cleansers that promise to do it all in one step, to targeted treatments addressing unique skin concerns, and formulations designed to harmonize with our skin\u2019s microbiome and efficiently remove sunscreen. This blog dives into the forefront of skincare innovation, exploring how brands are reshaping the daily ritual of cleansing into an experience that is both nurturing and tailored to the modern consumer\u2019s lifestyle. We\u2019ll uncover the latest trends driving the market, spotlight standout products making waves, and delve into what these developments mean for the future of skincare.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsRemove-it-all CleanserSkin Health ConsideredGentle Giants: Embracing the Microbiome-Friendly Cleansing WaveSunscreen Savvy Mastering the Art of SPF Removal\u201d</p> \n<h2>Remove-it-all Cleanser</h2> \n<p>Consumers are becoming increasingly tired of double-cleaning their faces after a long day at work. Not only do they have to remove their makeup, but they also have to wash their face again with a separate face wash. This can be a time-consuming and frustrating process, especially for those who are short on time. Consumers will seek products that skip the double cleanse but still deliver the same benefits.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there has been a growing trend of beauty brands developing double cleansers that can simultaneously remove makeup and cleanse the skin. These products are designed to streamline the skincare routine and save time in the process. One of the most well-known examples of this trend is Fenty Beauty\u2019s makeup removal and face wash in one product. With the convenience of a double cleanser, consumers can simply apply it to their face and wipe it off, removing both makeup and dirt from the skin in one easy step. This saves time and helps prevent irritation and clogged pores that can occur when using separate products. Other examples are the UK Gen X brand Skin Rocks and the US Gen Z brand Youthforia. They have both launched cleansers that claim to remove make-up, SPF, and daily impurities without stripping the skin while supporting the skin barrier, meeting the demand for streamlined routines across generations</p> \n<p>These hybrid cleansers cater to the growing trend of multifunctional beauty products while prioritizing skin health. Co-wash cleansers claim to provide a deep cleanse without compromising the skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier. US brand U-Beauty is at the forefront of this movement with its innovative The MANTLE Skin Conditioning Wash. This oil balm effectively removes impurities, and then transforms into a cleansing milk that supports the skin\u2019s natural acid mantle and optimal pH levels, all while promoting healthy skin.</p> \n<p>The popularity of double cleansers is expected to continue growing as consumers become more interested in simplifying their skincare routines and saving time in the process. As a result, beauty brands will likely continue to innovate and develop new products that combine multiple functions into one convenient formula.</p> \n<h2>Skin Health Considered</h2> \n<p>Gone are the days of a one-size-fits-all cleansing approach. Consumers are now seeking high-performance cleansers that cater to their specific skincare concerns. US brand Strip\u2019s \u201cskincare-grade\u201d The Caviar Jelly Makeup Remover is a prime example, featuring biphasic, microfluidic technology with clinically proven anti-aging benefits.</p> \n<p>Targeted, active ingredient-rich cleansers are becoming increasingly popular for those with sensitive skin. The concept of short contact therapy allows consumers to introduce and gradually adjust to actives like acne-fighting benzoyl peroxide. UK medicinal skincare brand Acnecide\u2019s Face Wash Spot Treatment is a prime example, using powerful ingredients in a targeted manner. To effectively address individual concerns, cleansers must be designed with life stage and hormonal changes in mind. US-based Womaness\u2019 Clean Slate cleanser, for instance, is tailored to sensitive, dry, and irritated skin commonly associated with menopause.</p> \n<p>Ingredients will play a starring role in the world of cleansers. By highlighting the activities included, their strength, and their effects on the skin throughout marketing and branding, brands can effectively communicate their value to consumers. UK brand The Inkey List is an excellent example, with its Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser for dry skin, Fulvic Acid cleanser for hyperpigmentation, and Salicylic Acid Cleanser for breakouts.</p> \n<p>By tailoring formulations to specific concerns and emphasizing the strength of key ingredients, brands can create a loyal following amongst intellectual consumers. The time is ripe for cleansers that offer targeted solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p> \n<h2>Gentle Giants: Embracing the Microbiome-Friendly Cleansing Wave</h2> \n<p>Cleansing is shifting towards gentle, microbiome-friendly products that work with the skin\u2019s barrier rather than against it. This trend is predicted to continue, driving demand for formulations that go beyond \u201cnon-stripping\u201d and \u201csoap-free\u201d and instead balance the microbiome and reduce irritation. Traditional face washes are known to cause barrier damage and skin sensitivity, leading many consumers to opt for gentler cleansers. According to WGSN Trend Curve analysis, microbiome beauty had 4.2% global penetration in 2023.</p> \n<p>Canadian brand Three Ships Beauty\u2019s Harmony Cleanser is designed to balance the skin\u2019s microbiome and cleanse in just 30 seconds. It contains prebiotic kombucha, cucumber extract, and glycerin for sensitive, sensitized, and reactive skin. Meanwhile, US skincare brand Murad\u2019s Soothing Oat and Peptide Cleanser is powered by micellar peptides that are 300 times more effective and gentler than typical cleansing sulfates, making it a great option for eczema-prone skin.</p> \n<p>To tap into the mind-skin connection and address the root causes of skin irritation, brands can harness emotional beauty principles with formulations that target anxiety and stress-related skin health deterioration. UK wellness brand Aromatherapy Associates offers three types of cleansers all containing the brand\u2019s proprietary Stress Relief Technology consisting of pink rock rose and pink algae, which are believed to help fight anxiety and promote healthy skin.</p> \n<p>By catering to the emotional and psychological aspects of skincare, brands can create products that not only cleanse and soothe the skin but also promote overall well-being and self-care. As the demand for gentle, microbiome-friendly cleansers continues to grow, it\u2019s clear that the future of skincare is all about working with the skin\u2019s barrier rather than against it.</p> \n<h2>Sunscreen Savvy Mastering the Art of SPF Removal\u201d</h2> \n<p>Rising sunscreen usage has led to increased demand for cleansers that can effectively remove sunscreen without causing blockages or breakouts. As concerns about SPF ingredients and their potential side effects persist, suncare brands are expanding into SPF-specific cleansers.</p> \n<p>US brand Pavise\u2019s Gentle Amino Powerwash uses a hybrid of oil and water-based ingredients to wash away waterproof sunscreen without stripping skin. In contrast, California-based Kelsen\u2019s Two-Part SPF 50 Sunscreen & Cleanser System offers a waterproof sunscreen and an Aer the Sun Zinc Sunscreen Remover + Hydrating Balm for quick and easy removal of zinc paste while keeping skin clean and moisturized. To tap into the travel and emerging hotel beauty market, brands can develop cleansers that effectively remove chlorine, salt, and sunscreen. US brand Aveda\u2019s Sun Care Hair and Body Cleanser provides a template for this approach. Meanwhile, Singaporean brand Only Skin Cleanse Protect Renew offers wash-on sun, blue light, and pollution protection, encouraging sunscreen use while providing a gentle and waterproof solution.</p> \n<p>As the convenience of wash-on sunscreens becomes more apparent, this format is likely to gain popularity. Rather than reapplying sunscreen throughout the day, consumers can simply wash it off with a cleanser, streamlining their skincare routine and reducing the risk of irritation. This white space opportunity presents a chance for brands to innovate and differentiate themselves in the crowded suncare market.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>As we\u2019ve explored the cutting-edge skincare cleansing trends, it\u2019s clear that the industry is undergoing a transformative shift towards more thoughtful, inclusive, and scientifically advanced solutions. Brands are not only responding to the immediate needs of consumers but are also anticipating the nuanced demands of future skincare regimes. The move towards hybrid cleansers, personalized cleanser wardrobes, microbiome-friendly products, and SPF-specific formulations represents a broader trend of holistic health, environmental consciousness, and a desire for simplicity without sacrificing quality. As consumers continue to seek out products that offer multiple benefits, cater to specific concerns, and support the overall health of their skin, the beauty industry is poised to innovate and evolve in exciting ways. This is a thrilling time for skincare enthusiasts and a pivotal moment for brands to make a meaningful impact on our daily lives and well-being. The future of skincare is bright, and it promises a landscape where health, efficacy, and convenience converge in harmony.</p> \n"}]}

Celebrity and influencer endorsements on social media are adding to these crazes.</p> \n<p>Asia Pacific and North America are the top emerging regional markets for eyelash glues, presenting lucrative opportunities for businesses to tap into.</p> \n<h2>Major factors to consider when purchasing eyelash extension glues</h2> \n<h3>Lashing speed</h3> \n<p>Lashing speed is defined by how fast a glue cures and adheres, making it one of the most important factors when stocking up onlash glues. The products a business chooses to offer must appropriately reflect their target consumers\u2019 needs.</p> \n<p>For example, beginners requirelash gluesthat dry slower so as to give them more time to secure their extensions. Likewise, fast-drying glues are more appropriate for experienced false eyelash users.</p> \n<p>The table below shows the appropriate drying time for various lashing speeds:</p> \n<h3>Glue quality</h3> \n<p>Buyers must also be aware of eyelash glue\u2019s potential fumes, making working with them uncomfortable for the user and their potential clients.</p> \n<p>Gluefumes can cause irritation for those with sensitive eyes. For this reason, businesses must prioritize eyelash glues with the lowest fumes possible.</p> \n<p>Therefore, it\u2019s essential that retailers check aneyelash glue\u2019spotential fume levels via the product\u2019s labels, with some manufacturers advertising their glues as \u201clow fume\u201d or \u201cfume-free.\u201d</p> \n<p>Next, check the ingredients to verify the manufacturer\u2019s claim; while most eyelash glues will contain cyanoacrylate (the ingredient responsible for adhesive properties), this is also the main culprit behind fumes. For this reason, it\u2019s best to opt forglueswith a lower cyanoacrylate content or glues containing acrylate copolymers or methacrylate, alternatives to cyanoacrylate.</p> \n<h3>Desired effect</h3> \n<p>Choosing the perfect lashextension gluealso involves considering color and finish, which can greatly impact the final look and consumer satisfaction.</p> \n<p>Consumers aiming for a subtle, natural look will tend to prefergluesthat dry clear. Clear glues seamlessly blend with natural lashes, ensuring discreet applications that enhance length and volume without drawing attention to the adhesive.</p> \n<p>Conversely, consumers looking for a dramatic effect may look for black lash adhesives, especially for volume and mega-volume applications. Dark finishes create a striking lash line and a more pronounced and defined look.</p> \n<p>Black lash gluesalso complement bold makeup styles, catering to those who appreciate glamorous and head-turning looks.</p> \n<h3>Usage environment</h3> \n<p>Eachlash extension gluehas specific optimal conditions when it comes to humidity and temperature. As a general guideline, glues with quicker drying times are more suited to high-humidity conditions, while slower-drying glues are better for lower-humidity environments.</p> \n<p>But, in general, most lash glues will perform optimally in temperatures slightly above the standard room temperature. However, when humidity exceeds the optimal level (around 60%), the cyanoacrylate in theglueis activated due to the excess moisture in the air, causing thelash adhesivesto cure and dry at an accelerated rate compared to regular room conditions. The opposite occurs when the room\u2019s humidity falls below optimal levels (lower than 45%).</p> \n<h3>Glue viscosity</h3> \n<p>Although humidity plays a big part inlash glueperformance, extremely hot or cold climates can also affect the adhesive\u2019s viscosity. Since lash adhesives are liquid, changes in temperature matter.</p> \n<p>Generally speaking,lash gluesbecome thicker in colder temperatures, leading to increased viscosity and a prolonged drying time. Conversely, higher temperatures make the glue more liquid, speeding up drying.</p> \n<p>Experts recommend opting forlash glueswith the best performance in room temperatures between 22 to 26oC (70 to 80oF). This helps lash techs create a controlled environment for perfect viscosity and consistent, efficient drying times.</p> \n<h2>Summary</h2> \n<p>Eyelash glues are a crucial addition to any lash extension kit, and the key to keeping false eyelashes in place for long periods.</p> \n<p>But before jumping into the market, sellers must consider their target consumers\u2019 lashing speed, likely lashing environment, desired effect, the adhesive\u2019s quality, and glue viscosity before stocking up.</p> \n<p>Whatever your retail needs, you\u2019re sure to find the right glue for your business among the thousands of options onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

The rise of soft masculinityis transforming the market, driven by a gender-inclusive approach that is rewriting the playbook for men\u2019s beauty. With the influence of social media and public figures, men are beginning to embrace a softer side of masculinity. The previously dominant alpha male narratives are being dismantled. Influenced heavily by the \u2018baby girl\u2019 culture prevalent on social media, men are now embracing a softer side of masculinity. This term, traditionally a term of endearment for women, is now being used to refer to men who break away from traditional masculine norms and embrace aspects of self-care and beauty. The rise of soft masculinity in the beauty industry presents a significant opportunity for online retailers. As male consumers become more open to exploring beauty products, the market expands, creating a demand for a wider range of products tailored to men\u2019s needs.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsDefining Soft MasculinitySocial Media TrendProduct TrendBrands Leading the WayConsumer Response</p> \n<h2>Defining Soft Masculinity</h2> \n<p>Soft masculinity represents a shift in the beauty industry\u2019s perception of male identity. Moving away from the traditional, rugged stereotypes of masculinity, soft masculinity embraces a gentler, more nurturing side. It\u2019s about men feeling comfortable expressing their emotions, taking care of their appearance, and breaking free from the constraints of conventional gender norms.</p> \n<p>This trend encourages men to explore self-care, skincare, and even makeup without the fear of judgment, redefining what it means to be masculine in today\u2019s society.</p> \n<h2>Social Media Trend</h2> \n<p>Social media and celebrities have played a pivotal role in popularizing soft masculinity in the beauty industry. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have become spaces where men can share their grooming routines, skincare tips, and makeup looks, inspiring others to do the same. Celebrities like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Harry Styles, and BTS have also contributed to this trend by embracing androgynous fashion and beauty, showcasing that self-expression and care are not bound by gender. Their influence has made it more acceptable for men to explore beauty products and express their individuality.</p> \n<h2>Product Trends:</h2> \n<h3>Skin Care Innovations</h3> \n<p>With the rise of soft masculinity, there\u2019s been a boom in beauty products tailored to men\u2019s skincare and makeup needs. Brands are rolling out lines specifically for guys, focusing on essentials like hydration, anti-aging, and acne treatment. Eye patches and lip care are becoming popular starting points. For instance, Topicals\u02bc eye patches aren\u2019t just for skincare \u2013 they\u2019re also a style statement and a sign of changing self-care priorities. In a similar vein, celebrities are encouraging men to see beauty in a new light.

These products are crafted to highlight natural features and offer a refined, understated appearance, in tune with the soft masculinity movement.

Meanwhile, the Swedish brand Obayaty\u2019s Eye Booster concealer is enriched with skincare ingredients and comes in stylish aluminum packaging, blending function with fashion.</p> \n<p>The trend extends beyond traditional makeup, as men explore products that cater to a wider range of beauty needs. Lip tints and mascaras designed for a subtle enhancement are gaining traction, allowing men to experiment with their looks while maintaining a natural aesthetic. Brands are also introducing grooming tools, such as precision tweezers and beard-shaping kits, to complement their makeup offerings.

However, their popularity and unbelievable results pushed several manufacturers to flood the market with thousands of devices.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, not all IPL devices offer the same functions and appearances, complicating the buying process even more. So, if retailers want to provide consumers with the best IPL device experience, they must put energy into choosing the right ones.</p> \n<p>This article has made the process easier by highlighting everything sellers should remember while purchasing IPL devices.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the global IPL hair removal device marketWhat are the benefits of IPL beauty procedures?Everything to consider before investing in IPL beauty devicesFinal words</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global IPL hair removal device market</h2> \n<p>Experts say theglobal IPL hair removal devicemarket touched US $351 million in 2022. Now, forecasts suggest the market\u2019s value will reach US $528.6 million by FY 2028 at a 7.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The increasing availability of high-tech products, rising disposable income, boosted aesthetic awareness, and increased demand for personal care products are driving market growth.</p> \n<p>Here are some other relevant statistics:</p> \n<h2>What are the benefits of IPL beauty procedures?</h2> \n<p>IPL hair removal devicesuse light spectrums to target dark pigments of unwanted hair, destroying them at the root. Unlike other hair removal methods (like waxing and epilating), IPL procedures are pain-free, although the treated area may feel a bit tender and look reddish.</p> \n<p>In addition,IPL beauty proceduresare one of the safest ways to get long-lasting hair removal results. They are quicker, more convenient, and more permanent than shaving sticks or wax, even on sensitive areas.</p> \n<h2>Everything to consider before investing in IPL beauty devices</h2> \n<h3>The consumer\u2019s requirements</h3> \n<p>Before stocking up onhair removal devices, retailers must know what they would do for their target consumers\u2014or if the devices would work for them. Check out some conditions consumers prioritize when purchasing IPL beauty devices.</p> \n<p>Usually,IPL devicessend their energy into the unwanted hair\u2019s pigment. These devices are super effective on dark hair, including brown, black, and dark blonde. However, they won\u2019t work properly for consumers with lighter hair colors.</p> \n<p>To combat this, some manufacturers equip their devices with an IPL and radio frequency technology combination, allowing lighter hair colors to enjoy the benefits of IPL hair removal.</p> \n<p>Skin type is another critical prerequisite for consumers. IPL light targets pigments, so it will also attack the skin if there\u2019s no noticeable difference between it and the hair.</p> \n<p>For this reason,IPL devicesare recommended for consumers with lighter skin tones, like ivory, fair, and light brown\u2014especially if they have enough contrast between their hair and skin.</p> \n<p>Darker-skinned consumers are not left out. Some IPL devices can work for them without any side effects\u2014but only if manufacturers combine them with other technologies like radio frequencies.</p> \n<p>Will the target consumer travel often? If yes, choosing devices that are easy to carry on trips is necessary. Focus on the accessories, packing case, size, and weight of the prospective device.</p> \n<p>Not allIPL hair removal deviceswill work on the same body areas. Some are perfect for the face and body, while others are more suited for sensitive or intimate areas.</p> \n<h3>Design and window size</h3> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the device\u2019s shape.IPL devicesusually feature gun-shaped designs that fit into the user\u2019s palms. So, businesses must prioritize models offering the best grip.</p> \n<p>However, if consumers want to reach tricky areas easily, they will prefer IPL devices with curved wand-shaped designs. Lastly, hair removal devices with straight-want slim designs are the easiest to hold, meaning consumers can use them all over their body without tiring their hands.</p> \n<p>In addition,the device\u2019swindow size should be large enough to handle large areas (like legs) quickly and smaller portions (like lips) efficiently. In other words, they must offer the sweet spot\u2014not too big or too small.</p> \n<h3>Power supply</h3> \n<p>IPL devicescan come with rechargeable batteries or a main power supply. Rechargeable models offer more freedom, as cords won\u2019t restrict movement. Nevertheless, sellers must factor in the charging time and battery duration to provide the best experience.</p> \n<p>Likewise, cordedIPL devicesoffer plug-and-play services but are limited by their cord length. So, consumers may find reaching areas not within the cord\u2019s reach challenging.</p> \n<h3>Energy output</h3> \n<p>Higher energy output translates to greater device efficiency. But despite the obvious advantage, great energy outputs also increase the chances of redness and skin irritation.</p> \n<p>But don\u2019t worry. MostIPL devicesonly output 6\u201310 J/cm2 of energy, safe enough to kill hair without side effects. But if target consumers can handle the heat, businesses can offer devices up to 20 J/cm2.</p> \n<h3>Number of flashes/lifespan</h3> \n<p>The number of flashesIPL devicescan deliver determines their lifespan. Since consumers will spend a good amount on these devices, they\u2019ll want something that will last for years.</p> \n<p>IPL devices offering 250,000 flashes may last up to 20 years on average, which is good enough for most people. But devices with 1 million flashes may last a lifetime without losing effectiveness.</p> \n<h3>Pain relief features</h3> \n<p>Although IPL treatments are mostly pain-free, some consumers may experience a rubber band snapping sensation during the procedure, creating a stinging sensation.</p> \n<p>If target consumers are worried about this potential side effect, retailers can opt forIPL deviceswith ice-cooling technology. This feature will help prevent even the smallest pain, giving consumers the best experience possible.</p> \n<h3>Intensity levels</h3> \n<p>Different consumers require various energy levels. In truth, even a single user needs multiple intensity levels for other body areas.</p> \n<p>As a result, sellers must prioritizeIPL devicesoffering a sizable amount of intensity. That way, consumers can easily treat their body, face, and other areas with stubborn hair without suffering the effects of using the wrong intensity.</p> \n<h3>Treatment modes</h3> \n<p>Consumers need different treatment modes to handle body hair quickly and facial hair precisely. For this reason, someIPL devicesoffer stamping modes, while others feature gliding techniques (usually divided into thumb-press or thumb-free gliding modes).</p> \n<p>Note: It\u2019s recommended that businesses opt for models offering both treatment modes.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>IPL beauty devices have revolutionized the way consumers deal with unwanted hair. Moreover, consumers will only reap the full benefits if these devices come in kits.</p> \n<p>For the best experience, users will need a safety razor for shaving, an IPL device for destroying hair follicles, and UV-protective glasses to keep their eyes safe. Although consumers can get them separately, businesses will offer more value if they come in a single kit.</p> \n<p>Combined with the factors discussed in this article, retailers are sure to get a higher ROI in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

These innovative formulations not only shield your skin from harmful UV rays but also deliver a wealth of skincare advantages. Beyond mere functionality, the \u2018skinication\u2019 of suncare extends its reach into the realms of texture and design, ensuring a delightful user experience.</p> \n<p>One shining example of this trend comes from the Australian brand Naked Sundays, with their SPF 50 Clear Glow Radiant Sunscreen Serum. Marketed as \u2018your one-stop morning product,\u2019 it unites the powers of a serum, moisturizer, and primer in one lightweight, invisible formula.

With increased awareness about the damaging effects of UV rays, more people are looking for effective sun protection. This shift is driven by busy lifestyles and a desire for simplified daily routines, where individuals seek products that can serve multiple purposes, providing both sun protection and simplifying their makeup application process.</p> \n<p>Ultraviolette has recognized that consumers not only want protection from the harmful effects of the sun but also seek products that enhance their overall skin health and appearance.

Marketed as an all-in-one morning product, it combines the benefits of a serum, moisturizer, and primer while delivering sun protection. This approach caters to individuals looking for a streamlined skincare routine without compromising on sun safety.</p> \n<p>This trend reflects a broader consumer desire for comprehensive sun care that not only shields against UV damage but also contributes to healthier, more radiant skin, all encapsulated in convenient and multifunctional formulations.</p> \n<h2>Microbiome Harmony: The New Frontier in SPF Technology</h2> \n<p>In 2024, the suncare industry takes a giant leap with SPF products focusing on the skin microbiome. Recognizing the crucial role of the skin\u2019s natural flora, these products are designed to protect and nourish the microbiome while offering robust sun protection.</p> \n<p>According to research conducted by the Swiss ingredient supplier DSM-Firmenich, exposure to the sun can negatively affect the skin\u2019s microbiome. UV filters, which safeguard the skin and beneficial bacteria from harmful UV rays, such as those found in Vytrus Biotech\u2019s Photobiome from Spain, are becoming increasingly popular.</p> \n<p>Suncare products aimed at enhancing the skin\u2019s microbiome are incorporating prebiotics, postbiotics, and ferments to strengthen the skin\u2019s protective barrier. The French brand SeventyOne Percent\u2019s Feel Free SPF30 DD Cream is a skincare treatment that includes prebiotics in addition to UV filters.</p> \n<p>This trend reflects a deeper understanding of skin health, where suncare products are not just barriers against UV rays but also supporters of the skin\u2019s intrinsic ecosystems.</p> \n<h2>Comprehensive Care: Suncare Beyond Facial Boundaries</h2> \n<p>Expanding the scope of suncare, 2024 sees a holistic approach where protection extends to the entire body. Specialized products are emerging for areas like hands, arms, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9, acknowledging that sun protection is a full-body necessity.</p> \n<p>Hair health has gained significant importance among consumers, emphasizing the need for protective scalp products in the realm of hair care. The increasing popularity of mist-based products and specialized scalp solutions has impacted this category. Sun Bum, a Florida-based company, offers Scalp & Hair Mist SPF 30, a lightweight and nourishing mist that shields the scalp from the sun\u2019s effects without causing hair to feel heavy. In terms of head care, the inclusion of SPF is crucial for individuals who are bald or experiencing hair thinning. Mantl, a US-based brand, has developed Invisible Daily SPF 30 with a focus on addressing the needs of these specific customer groups. This formulation is designed to provide a mattifying effect and has been dermatologist-tested.</p> \n<p>The hands are particularly susceptible to sun damage due to their constant exposure to UV rays. In the post-pandemic era, interest in hand care has gained prominence. Unsun, a US-based brand, offers Protect & Smooth Emollient Rich Hand Cream, which not only addresses dry skin with ingredients like aloe vera, shea butter, and coconut oil but also provides sun protection. Another brand, Africa Organics from South Africa, incorporates antioxidants, UV protection, and moisturizing properties across its range of haircare and body care products.</p> \n<p>This trend indicates a shift in consumer awareness and industry response, recognizing that comprehensive sun protection is integral to overall skin health and beauty.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion:</h2> \n<p>As the beauty industry continues to evolve, our quest for holistic sun protection and radiant skin remains unwavering.

Wrinkles start forming, and skin becomes saggy\u2014mostly because the body stops producing enough collagen to keep the youthful look.</p> \n<p>But when consumers don\u2019t like the aging look, what can they do? Well, businesses can offer them specialized devices that help rejuvenate the skin, making the signs, like wrinkles, less visible.</p> \n<p>Explore this article to discover five anti-wrinkle device trends with amazing effects consumers will love.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the global anti-wrinkle device market5 top-trending devices to help consumers fight aging and wrinklesRounding up</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global anti-wrinkle device market</h2> \n<p>In 2022, experts valued the global anti-wrinkle device market at US $10.96 billion. They also expect it to experience continuous growth at an 8.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2030.</p> \n<p>The increasing awareness about age-related skin problems, like fine lines, wrinkles, and skin dullness, is the market\u2019s major growth driver. Consumers are more likely to spend on devices that sustain youthful appearances, which experts also say will boost market growth.</p> \n<p>Asia-Pacific dominated the market in 2022, by contributing 36.10% of the total revenue share. North America was also one of the major regional markets for anti-aging devices in 2022 due to better living conditions, high per capita income, and easy product availability.</p> \n<h2>5 top-trending devices to help consumers fight aging and wrinkles</h2> \n<h3>1. Microcurrent devices</h3> \n<p>Traditional beauty products likeserumsand creams have long been mainstays, but new trends are rising to take over the at-home skincare tool scene\u2014and one of them ismicrocurrent devices.</p> \n<p>These devices are gaining popularity, as users say consistent use results in firmer and more defined skin. But what are these devices?Microcurrent beauty toolsuse low-voltage electrical currents to stimulate the facial muscles. This procedure may help the user\u2019s face look tighter and reduce visible aging signs.</p> \n<p>The best part is that consumers can getmicrocurrent devicesto use at home. They are special handheld devices that won\u2019t shoot up the user\u2019s electricity bill. Alternatively, businesses can offer more powerful models to dermatologists or estheticians.</p> \n<p>Microcurrent devicesmay not have any scientific research to support their claims, but they\u2019ve been getting much attention in 2023. According to Google Ads data, branded variants like \u201cForeo Bear\u201d and \u201cNuface Mini\u201d average 40,500 and 33,100 searches monthly.</p> \n<p>The generic variants are also holding their own, search-wise. In November 2023, they garnered 12,100 searches, proving consumers are actively looking for these devices.</p> \n<h3>2. LED light therapy devices</h3> \n<p>LED therapyharnesses different light wavelengths for skincare treatments. They discovered its significant potential for skin care applications initially developed by NASA to stimulate plant growth.</p> \n<p>Now, various aestheticians useLED light therapy devicesto help revitalize the skin, reducing the signs of aging. Usually, these devices use red or blue light to treat skincare concerns\u2014blue is for acne treatment, while red works for anti-aging.</p> \n<p>Compared to other types of light therapy, LEDs don\u2019t create ultraviolet rays, meaning they\u2019re safe for regular use. These devices won\u2019t cause burns like other anti-aging treatments like chemical peels, laser therapy, and dermabrasion.</p> \n<p>Consumers shouldn\u2019t worry if they can\u2019t make frequent trips to aestheticians\u2014they can still enjoy LED light therapy at home. Devices businesses can offer include LED wands and masks that users can apply on their faces for several minutes at a time.</p> \n<p>LED light therapy maskshave witnessed significant growth in 2023. In October, they garnered 90,500 searches\u2014impressive, but nothing compared to their 135,000 searches in November 2023! That\u2019s a 60% boost in one month!</p> \n<p>LED wands may not be as popular as their mask counterparts, but they\u2019ve also seen some growth. They jumped from 8,100 in September to 9,900 in November 2023.</p> \n<h3>3. Radiofrequency (RF) devices</h3> \n<p>Radiofrequency (RF) devicesprovide skin-tightening effects to help smoothen skin. They generate enough heat to kickstart the facial skin\u2019s collagen, elastin, and new cell production.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s great about these devices is that they are a non-surgical way to get facelifting effects for sagging skin. Although they offer temporary benefits, consumers won\u2019t be able to differentiate between performing surgery and using these devices.</p> \n<p>While the heat may worry some consumers, these devices are one of the safest ways to fight aging effects. They use safe low-frequency electromagnetic waves to generate the heat that enters the user\u2019s skin layers\u2014no safety hazards here.</p> \n<p>Speaking of safety,RF deviceshave very slim chances of causing hyperpigmentation. However, it\u2019s ideal for younger consumers with fresh signs of aging and won\u2019t work for severely wrinkled or saggy skin.</p> \n<p>RF technology can also be combined with other devices to offer better anti-wrinkle treatments. For instance, consumers can use radiofrequency microneedling to target early signs of aging. Another type combines LED light therapy withRFto create devices that help promote collagen production.</p> \n<p>RF microneedling is one of the more popular types, with a consistent 49,500 monthly searches throughout 2023. Regular radiofrequency devices only get 8,100 searches, but it\u2019s still impressive.</p> \n<h3>4. Ultrasound devices</h3> \n<p>Regarding nourishing, anti-aging facial treatments, ultrasound facial therapies are top. These devices use high-level sound (or ultrasonic) waves to stimulate the skin, penetrating deep below the surface.</p> \n<p>In addition to smoothing wrinkles, thesefacial therapy devicespromote cellular renewal/repair, increase blood circulation, combat puffiness, improve blood circulation, and encourage lymphatic drainage.</p> \n<p>Basically, retailers can invest in two types of ultrasonic skin care devices: hand-held and table-top. Hand-held models are more popular for home use because of their user-friendliness and lack of need for professional assistance.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, table-top ultrasound beauty devices offer stronger results but need professional hands to be effective. Also, they often come with additional features, like facial massagers and steamers. Table-top ultrasound devices are more common in esthetician offices with dedicated treatment rooms.</p> \n<h3>5. Microneedling devices</h3> \n<p>Microneedling deviceshelp address various skin concerns. Unlike other light- or sound-based devices, this method makes physical contact with small, sterile needles, puncturing the skin and inducing controlled physical trauma.</p> \n<p>The good news is that it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. This process pushes the dermis (a deeper skin layer) to start rebuilding, allowing it to produce more collagen to keep the skin youthful.Microneedling devicescan help address many anti-aging concerns, including wrinkles and saggy skin.</p> \n<p>However, results from microneedling are not immediate. It may take several months for consumers to see results since the process involves new skin growth. Regardless, microneedling is an effective and safe way to treat wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin.</p> \n<p>Microneedlingis the most popular anti-wrinkle solution on this list. These devices average 550,000 searches monthly, and it has been consistent since July 2023.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>The anti-aging landscape constantly evolves, introducing exciting tools businesses can capitalize on in 2024. Microcurrent devices are ideal for consumers who don\u2019t mind a little shock, whileLED light therapyis the safest way to deal with wrinkles.</p> \n<p>RF devices offer a hotter alternative, and ultrasonic offers a more alternative. Lastly, microneedling is the most popular procedure for restoring youthfulness to aging faces.</p> \n<p>So don\u2019t hesitate! The market is booming, making it the perfect time to enter the anti-wrinkle industry in 2024!</p> \n"}]}

Snail mucin has been used for inflammation, anti-aging, wound healing, and the treatment of dry skin in the past, and the ingredient has grown in popularity today. Snail mucin is harvested by having snails roam around a dark room on a mesh or glass surface. The snails are then removed and transferred to their home. The mucin is scraped off and processed intosnail secretion filtrate. Due to snail mucin being an animal byproduct, the ingredient is not vegan, but it is generally cruelty-free and ethical.</p> \n<h2>Top benefits of snail mucin</h2> \n<p>Theingredients found in snail mucinare good for the skin. Several of the ingredients in snail mucin are hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, collagen, and copper peptides.

Snail mucin should not clog pores or cause acne breakouts. However, like with any skincare ingredient, it is possible to have an allergic reaction and irritation if your customer is allergic to snails.</p> \n<p>Sensitive skin can also react negatively to snail mucin, especially from the exfoliating properties of the glycolic acid. Snail mucin can cause inflammation and irritation and exacerbate existing acne for sensitive skin. Therefore, it is recommended to do a patch test first on a small section of the skin before applying the snail mucin to the face.</p> \n<h2>Best types of snail mucin products</h2> \n<p>Snail mucincan be found in various skincare products, including the following:</p> \n<p>Cleanser and face wash:There are cleansers and face washes that include snail mucin as one of the ingredients.

Wash-off masks can hydrate dry skin, brighten and rejuvenate the skin, reduce redness and inflammation, and clear blemishes. Sheet masks with snail mucin are used to hydrate and nourish the skin.</p> \n<p>Eye cream:Along with face products, there are snail mucin products that are targeted for the eye area.

Gone are the days when sunscreen was just a sticky, white paste you begrudgingly smeared on at the beach. Today, it\u2019s a star player in beauty routines worldwide, a testament to our growing wisdom about skin health and the joy of basking safely in the sun\u2019s glow.</p> \n<p>In this blog, we embark on an exhilarating global journey to unearth the latest trends and cutting-edge innovations in sun care. As a retailer, you\u2019re in the perfect spot to gain essential insights into the newest wave of the sun care industry. Join us on this enlightening expedition, where we\u2019ll arm you with all the knowledge you need to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of sun protection. Let\u2019s explore the sun-soaked innovations and the rays of change in the world of suncare!</p> \n<h2>Awakening to Sun Safety: The Global Uptake of Suncare Awareness</h2> \n<p>The world is embracing suncare like never before, making it a star player in skincare regimes across different regions. In this global tour of suncare, it\u2019s clear that the world is not just soaking up the sun but also the best in sun protection innovation. It\u2019s more than just applying sunscreen; it\u2019s about carefully creating products that match different beauty standards and weather conditions, making them enjoyable to use and effective.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the research, where suncare is soaring with an impressive 8.3% annual growth (CAGR 2022-2030, per Statista). K-Beauty is setting the pace here, with a spotlight on barrier-strengthening sunscreens. Think innovative formulas that not only shield you from the sun but also fortify your skin\u2019s microbiome.</p> \n<p>Take Malaysia\u2019s Sky Resources, for example. Their Rebiome Sunscreen is pioneering with polylysine, a wonder ingredient enhancing skin-friendly bacteria. Meanwhile, South Korea\u2019s Beauty of Joseon introduces The Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics, a sunscreen enriched with grain-fermented extracts, a boon for your skin\u2019s microbiome.</p> \n<p>Moving to India, there\u2019s a sun cream revolution underway. Social media is the catalyst, fueling a surge in awareness and interest. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming one of the most sought-after beauty products,\u201d says Rohit Chawl, founder and CEO of Innovist, as reported by Cosmetic Design-Asia. Innovist\u2019s Sunscoop range, launched in April 2022, is already making waves, contributing a significant 10% to the brand\u2019s revenue. Africa is not far behind in this suncare renaissance, with indie brands leading the charge. One standout is Cape Town\u2019s SKOON, a beacon of natural and sustainable beauty. Their SUNNYBONANI Day defense sun cream SPF 20 is a tribute to Africa, a mineral-based marvel drawing inspiration from the continent\u2019s rich landscape.</p> \n<h2>#Embracing Diversity: The Revolution in Sun Care for Every Skin Tone</h2> \n<p>As globalisation, the sun care industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of catering to different skin tones. Historically, sunscreen products were often designed without considering how they would look and feel on diverse skin types, particularly for people with deep skin tones. Brands are increasingly formulating these products in a range of shades to cater to diverse skin tones, ensuring that everyone can find a match that complements their natural skin color.</p> \n<p>An example is the Brazilian brand Sallve, which offers a range of 10 shades in its tinted sunscreen line, catering to a diverse consumer base. This inclusivity is not just a nod to the broader trend of diversity in beauty products, but it also addresses practical concerns, such as avoiding the white cast often left by traditional sunscreens on darker skin tones.</p> \n<p>The uniqueness of skin tones and their undertones are now key considerations in sunscreen formulation. For example, Rom&nd, a South Korean brand, carefully analyzed East Asian skin undertones in the creation of its White Rice Tone-up Sun Cushion. This product cleverly combines 15% peach and 85% white pigments to achieve skin-brightening effects without leaving any unwanted residue.</p> \n<p>On social media, color-changing sunscreen formulations are becoming increasingly popular. A notable example is the #Colorescience\u2019s Sunforgettable SPF from the United States.</p> \n<p>This product transitions from white to a medium-coverage foundation, suitable for various skin tones. Its impressive popularity is evident from its more than 108.7 million views on TikTok.</p> \n<h2>#Easy-to-Apply Sunscreens are Viral</h2> \n<p>The primary challenge with traditional sunscreen is its sticky texture, which can be particularly inconvenient for those in a hurry. This often unpleasant feel can lead to people skipping sunscreen application, even though it\u2019s essential for skin protection. Recognizing this, manufacturers are innovating to create formulas that are more user-friendly, absorbing quickly without leaving a tacky residue, thereby encouraging regular and comfortable use.</p> \n<p>Take Habit, a brand from New York, for example, which has become a hit on TikTok with its SPF mists. Their No38 sunscreen, with a unique cucumber scent, veers away from the typical fruity aromas of traditional sunscreens. \u201cWe\u2019re redefining what sunscreen can be by bringing in elements usually found in regular skincare products. This is changing how consumers view sunscreen,\u201d Tai Adaya, Habit\u2019s founder, shared with Beauty Independent.</p> \n<p>As lifestyles become more flexible, there\u2019s an increasing demand for sun protection products that are portable and easy to apply, such as sticks, powders, and mists, catering to the needs of consumers who are always on the move. Another innovative approach comes from Supergoop!, a leading U.S. suncare brand, with its (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder SPF 35. This product is a two-in-one solution, serving as both a setting powder and a transparent SPF. Its compact, brush-equipped design makes it perfect for easy and frequent application throughout the day.</p> \n<h2>#Sun Safety with a Budget: Industry\u2019s Inclusive Response</h2> \n<p>Amidst the widespread economic downturn and increasing cost of living, another pressing trend has emerged: the rise in \u2018sun poverty\u2019. Tighter budgets are compelling families to prioritize daily essentials over sun protection, inadvertently increasing the risk of serious future health issues.</p> \n<p>The beauty industry is acutely aware of this issue, especially as concerns grow among parents and educators that suncare might be overlooked due to financial constraints. In the UK, where temperatures soared to record highs in the summer of 2022, the British e-retailer Escentual, in collaboration with brands like Clarins and Shiseido, and various beauty experts, has proactively addressed this concern. Their #SunPoverty campaign, initiated in 2021, aimed to distribute 20,000 sunscreens to children and set a goal to donate 30,000 high-protection sunscreens to lower-income families across the UK. They aspire to ensure that by 2025, all primary school children have access to free sunscreen.</p> \n<p>In this climate of reduced disposable incomes, affordable suncare options have become increasingly appealing. Consumers are now looking for budget-friendly products, with a shift towards family-oriented formulations that are suitable for everyone in the household.</p> \n<p>Prioritizing both affordability and accessibility, Australian suncare brand BEAUTI-FLTR is responding to this trend by offering quality suncare at budget-friendly prices. Their products, including the Lustre Mineral SPF 50+ and Feather Light SPF 50+, are priced competitively at $25 (\u00a313) for a standard 75g, which works out to approximately $0.33 (18p) per gram.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Our journey through the vibrant and innovative world of sun care has revealed a dynamic industry at the forefront of beauty and skincare. From the diverse shades of tinted sunscreens catering to every skin tone to the cutting-edge formulations making sun protection a delightful part of our daily routine, it\u2019s clear that sun care is no longer a mere afterthought but a central player in our health and beauty regimes. This evolution mirrors a deeper societal shift towards inclusivity, practicality, and awareness, reflecting our collective commitment to not just enjoying the sun, but doing so responsibly and stylishly. As retailers we stand at the cusp of a sun care revolution, one that promises to keep us safe under the sun while celebrating the unique beauty of every individual. Let\u2019s continue to embrace these changes, championing sun safety and skin health for all, as we look forward to even more exciting innovations on the horizon.\u201d</p> \n"}]}

The best part is that businesses can offer these devices to consumers searching for affordable ways to eliminate saggy skin.</p> \n<p>But before that, keep reading to discover how to choose these revolutionary devices and learn other things about them.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat\u2019s special about radiofrequency (RF) therapy?Can consumers use RF skin tightening at home?Do their benefits make them worthy investments?What should businesses consider before offering RF machines?What else do consumers need to use RF machines?Rounding up</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s special about radiofrequency (RF) therapy?</h2> \n<p>RF therapyis like a magic trick for aging skin, working wonders to tighten things up and bring back the much-needed youthful glow. It uses radio frequencies to send heat deep into the user\u2019s skin layers.</p> \n<p>However, this heat is not dangerous. It only encourages the skin to produce more collagen and elastin. The result? Firm, fabulous skin with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.</p> \n<p>Usually, the focus ofRF treatmentsis on the face and neck, and the whole process may take about an hour. If consumers want professional hands, they should consider aestheticians in spas.</p> \n<p>RF therapy offers immediate results that last for months, and it\u2019s perfect for special occasions or when ladies want a little lift without going under the knife.</p> \n<h2>Can consumers use RF skin tightening at home?</h2> \n<p>Absolutely! At-homeradiofrequency deviceswork just like their professional counterparts. And they\u2019re even more flexible, allowing consumers to enjoy their treatments in various settings based on their preferences.</p> \n<p>In other words, RF machines are great additions to regular skin care.</p> \n<h2>Do their benefits make them worthy investments?</h2> \n<p>RF tightening devicesgenerate high frequencies that do more than just tighten skin. Here\u2019s a list of the various benefits that make these devices worthy investments:</p> \n<p>Still not convinced? Check out their market stats: theRF therapy marketreached US $665 million in 2022, with experts projecting it will reach US $1.6 billion by 2032 at a 9.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<h2>What should businesses consider before offering RF machines?</h2> \n<h3>The machine type</h3> \n<p>Who do businesses want to cater to? Do they want salons/spas as target consumers? Or are they targeting at-home users? These questions help determine the bestRF devicesto buy in bulk.</p> \n<p>So, if sellers have salons and spas as their targets, they should consider professional RF devices. Their higher energy outputs are more effective at handling skin concerns than at-home variants.</p> \n<p>But if retailers cater to regular users, at-home RF devices are the way to go. They havehandheld designsthat make them convenient for users who want to perform these treatments comfortably. Plus, they\u2019re more affordable than their professional counterparts.</p> \n<h3>Features</h3> \n<p>Some RF devices have heating and cooling features, so consumers can choose their preferred treatment. Others only offer the hottest intensity levels for maximum benefits.</p> \n<p>Further, RF machines must also be compatible with other attachments to provide seamless experiences. Some even have safety features like built-in timers to prevent consumers from overdoing their treatments.</p> \n<p>Other safety features to look out for include automatic shut-off and overheating protection\u2014they\u2019ll help avoid unnecessary injury and boost safety.</p> \n<p>Lastly, RF devices should have adjustable treatment settings, especially at-home models, so consumers can easily customize sessions to their unique needs.</p> \n<h3>Frequency range</h3> \n<p>The device\u2019s frequency range determines how deep the energy will penetrate the skin. RF devices offering lower frequencies can penetrate deeper, making them the go-to for combating deeper wrinkles and skin laxity.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,RF devicesoffering higher frequency ranges are ideal for surface treatments like handling wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes and lips.</p> \n<h3>Treatment area</h3> \n<p>What area do target consumers want to treat? The answer determines the type of RF device consumers will need. At-homemodelstypically feature smaller treatment heads, making them ideal for addressing specific areas, like the periorbital region.</p> \n<p>Conversely, consumers hoping to treat larger areas like the abdomen will need something bigger. Such cases often require professional devices featuring larger treatment heads and a trip to the spa.</p> \n<h3>Power output</h3> \n<p>Power output determines how deep the RF device\u2019s heat penetrates the skin and the intensity of the treatment. Naturally, higher power outputs lead to more benefits, like better skin tightening and collagen stimulation.</p> \n<p>But not every situation needs high power outputs. Here\u2019s a table showing the different power outputs for RF skin-tightening devices and their best uses.</p> \n<p>Note: Skin type also determines the power output consumers will need. Consumers with sensitive skin can only use low-power output devices.</p> \n<h3>Temperature control</h3> \n<p>Since these devices deal with heat, temperature control is a necessary feature businesses must watch out for. RF devices that don\u2019t have this feature may be tricky to regulate and end up burning the user or underperforming.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, businesses have options. They can stock up on variants with automatic temperature control or choose models featuring manual adjustments. Automatic variants are ideal for consumers who prefer convenience and hassle-free experiences, while manual controls offer more precision.</p> \n<h2>What else do consumers need to use RF machines?</h2> \n<p>Consumers need gliding gel to use RF skin tightening devices effectively. This special gel helps the radiofrequency energy work better by connecting the device to the user\u2019sskin. This process also reduces friction and prevents skin irritation.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>While radiofrequency skin tightening is safe when consumers receive the treatment from qualified professionals, it\u2019s a different ballgame for at-home use. Unfortunately, consumers are at higher risk of complications when performing RF therapies at home.</p> \n<p>But don\u2019t worry. Sellers can help minimize the risks by ensuring their RF machines come with manufacturer instructions. That way, consumers will know the safest way to use their at-home RF therapy devices.</p> \n<p>So, don\u2019t hesitate! Use the tips discussed in this article to navigate the RF machine market in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

However, Asia-Pacific will witness outstanding growth due to the change in customer tendencies, the rising number of people, growing globalization, and the extension of optional capital.</p> \n<h2>5 trendy eyelash extension tools to stock in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Tweezer sets</h3> \n<p>Eyelash tweezersare made to help with the little details of lash artistry. These tools are indispensable, as lash artists need them to apply eyelash extensions from start to finish.</p> \n<p>Although various tweezer types currently flood the market, beginners need only three for lash applications: straight, isolation, and curved (or L-shaped) tweezers.</p> \n<p>Straight tweezers are the basic ones everyone should have. They can pick up eyelash extensions with ease. Further, their designs ensure consumers have the firmest grip on their lash extensions.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, isolation tweezers are necessary for keeping the natural lashes away from extensions. They have slightly curved undersides, making it easy to get perfect isolation\u2014no clumpy, unattractive lashes!</p> \n<p>Curved tweezers are the go-to for creating eye-catching volume eyelash looks. With these tweezers, ladies can easily control the lash fan volume, resulting in effortless and great finishing.</p> \n<p>Other tweezers that may come in a moreprofessional setinclude pointed straight, pointed curve, pointed edge, volume, and round volume lash tweezers.</p> \n<p>Sincetweezersare a must-have tool, it\u2019s no surprise they also do well search-wise. Google Ads data shows that these lash tools attracted 246,000 searches in November 2023\u2014a 20% increase from September\u2019s 201,000 inquiries.</p> \n<h3>2. Lash adhesives</h3> \n<p>Lash adhesivesare also very important for eyelash extensions. Since eyelash extensions are synthetic, they need something to bond them to the natural lashes without any side effects. That\u2019s why consumers can\u2019t just use any adhesives they want.</p> \n<p>Regular adhesives contain ingredients that may lead to lash loss. Even worse, consumers may have serious allergies or suffer from eye damage.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, manufacturers make lash glues with various ingredients that will get the job done without causing any harm. For instance, cyanoacrylates are a main adhesive ingredient inlash glues, as they are highly compatible with human skin, hair, and other organic tissues.</p> \n<p>In addition, lash artists can choose between two adhesive varieties, depending on their skill level: slow-drying and fast-drying lash glues. Here\u2019s a brief look at both options:</p> \n<p>Lash adhesives also gained increased attention in 2023. While not as popular as tweezers, they\u2019ve grown from 40,500 in October to 49,500 in November 2023.</p> \n<h3>3. Gel pads & lash tape</h3> \n<p>Different things can happen while applying lash extensions. The lower lashes could get in the way, or the client\u2019s skin may get irritated, leading to a less-than-ideal experience. Well,gel padsand lash tapes can fix that.</p> \n<p>Gel pads help shield the lower lashes, preventing them from gluing to the upper ones. As a result, lash artists can avoid causing their clients discomfort or damaging their lashes. They also create a barrier between the skin around the eyes and lash adhesives, reducing potential irritation and redness.</p> \n<p>Conversely, lash tape simply secures the natural lashes and extensions in place. They\u2019re adhesive strips that some lash technicians use instead of gel pads. However, usinglash tapesalone can be uncomfortable for clients, especially when removing lashes after application.</p> \n<p>But when combined, these tools provide an even better experience. While the gel pad creates a more soothing and relaxing experience, lash tapes help to secure rogue lashes that escape from under the pads.</p> \n<p>According to Google Ads, gel pads get a consistent 14,800 monthly searches, while lash tapes get 3,600.</p> \n<h3>4. Eyelash brushes</h3> \n<p>Whether consumers rock natural lashes or extensions, they\u2019ll need eyelash brushes to comb and fluff them regularly. These tools help remove buildup (dirt, makeup, or skin cells), helping extensions last longer and improving their appearance.</p> \n<p>Eyelash brushesalso help during the application process. Consumers can use these tools to ensure everything stays well-adhered and separated. Further, they are great for securing stray lashes and checking if the extension needs more adhesives.</p> \n<p>If consumers don\u2019t want the hassle of cleaning standard eyelash brushes, they can get disposable ones. They\u2019re more convenient and can come in 100 pieces or more bundles.</p> \n<p>Eyelash brushes\u2019performance may be low, but they\u2019re still gaining enough attention to be profitable. In November 2023, they averaged 9,900 searches, showing thousands of potential customers are searching for eyelash brushes.</p> \n<h3>5. Lash adhesive remover</h3> \n<p>Eventually, consumers will have to remove their lash extensions. When that time comes, all they need to make the process easier arelash adhesive removers.</p> \n<p>Gel removers are the most popular types available. Consumers can use them to remove partial or entire eyelash extension sets. However, cream removers are the safer way to remove lash extensions.</p> \n<p>Unlike gels, cream removers can detach the entire eyelash extension set in one application.

In addition, over 9,000 users have savedthis\u201caluminum-free deodorant recommendation\u201d TikTok reel.</p> \n<p>This move away fromaluminum-baseddeodorants \u2013 which often feature ingredients such as aluminum chlorohydrate or aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly \u2013 is largely due to concerns about their potential links to health issues like breast cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p> \n<p>Some alternative options to traditional aluminum deodorants include stone and salt deodorants from trusted companies like Wild Natural Deodorant and Lume Deodorant.</p> \n<h2>Blue light protection</h2> \n<p>Consumers are also increasingly looking for advanced sunscreens, including \u201cblue light\u201d sunscreens, with searches growing by 40% over the past year compared with the year before.</p> \n<p>Blue light sunscreenis specially designed to protect skin from blue light emitted by the sun.</p> \n<p>Blue light, which falls within the shorter wavelength range of the visible light spectrum, can cause hyperpigmentation that makes skin darker and patchy. It has also been found to contribute to premature aging, collagen breakdown, and skin barrier damage.</p> \n<p>Blue light sunscreens contain iron oxide, which adds an extra layer to protect the skin from light from this specific wavelength.</p> \n<p>Companies making blue light sunscreen includeUV Doux,Coola, andBlue Lizard.</p> \n<h2>Zero-waste haircare</h2> \n<p>Another big personal care trend of 2024 iszero-waste haircare, including zero-waste shampoos thanks to a growing awareness of the downsides of plastics. This shift to zero-waste shampoos means the industry is forecast to be worthUSD 277.56million by 2032 at a CAGR of 5%.</p> \n<p>Zero-waste products prioritize packaging that doesn\u2019t create a lot of waste, such as items that can be recycled, composted, or refilled. The ingredients used in these products are also environmentally friendly and don\u2019t contain harsh chemicals.</p> \n<p>Popular zero-waste shampoo companies of the moment include Kitsch Shampoo and Zero Waste Stores, which make eco-friendly items like bamboo combs and biodegradable hair ties.</p> \n<p>In summary, zero-waste hair care is all about making smart, eco-friendly choices while keeping hair looking good and the planet healthy.</p> \n<h2>Technological advancements</h2> \n<p>In recent years, the beauty industry has been waking up to personalized skincare routines, and 2024 will be no different. Consumers increasingly prefer tools that help them create personalized skincare routines, as outlined in this recent interview withbeauty insiderKim Day.</p> \n<p>Here artificial intelligence and augmented reality tools are spicing up the game. AI-driven products and tools in the beauty and cosmetics market are expected to reachUSD 13.34 billionby 2030, recording a promising CAGR of 19.7% between 2021 and then.</p> \n<p>These products are providing new ways for brands to engage with the consumer, bringing efficiency and customized solutions via virtual applications and personalized product selection offerings.

Caffeine cream, for example, is increasing in popularity every year as seen in the graph below:</p> \n<p>Once a staple on kitchen shelves, caffeine is now finding its place in beauty cabinets, promising a morning wake-up call for the skin thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p> \n<p>When applied topically, caffeine does more than perk up the skin; it\u2019s a multitasker that reduces wrinkles, brightens the skin, and de-puffs by boosting blood circulation.</p> \n<p>Caffeine demand is also increasing in haircare and fragrances due to its stimulating and energetic properties. It stimulates hair growth by strengthening hair roots.</p> \n<p>Caffeine-infused productsare particularly versatile, and can be used around the eyes, face, and body. It\u2019s become especially favored by eye cream companies, who have harnessed caffeine\u2019s de-puffing properties to be used around this delicate area, helping consumers reduce the effects of salty foods, sun exposure, sleep deprivation, or a lack of exercise.</p> \n<p>Companies making popular caffeine skincare products include Kiehl\u2019s and The Inkey List.</p> \n<h2>Water filtering products</h2> \n<p>Bodycare is another major player in 2024 trends, with consumers putting an increased emphasis on water quality for skin and hair care.

In addition, hard water doesn\u2019t lather properly and can strip the skin and hair of their natural oils, making products cling to the skin and making the scalp, hair, and skin dry.</p> \n<p>Overall, growing consumer preferences for home spas, increasing environmental awareness, and a rise in the understanding of dermatological conditions have increased demand for water filtering products.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The beauty industry in 2024 is shifting towards eco-friendly and personalized products. As such, consumers are opting for items like aluminum-free deodorants, blue light sunscreens, caffeine-infusedskincare products, and zero-waste haircare, reflecting a focus on health and sustainability.

Indeed, maintaining a well-groomed mane is increasingly crucial in today\u2019s image-conscious society, where personal appearance is often amplified by social media.</p> \n<p>Therefore, people are increasingly looking to tools for easy upkeep, like hair wax sticks, offering precise and convenient hair styling solutions to raise hair grooming standards.

As shown in the picture above, this ease of use is facilitated by its innovative tube-like applicator, which directly applies solid wax to the user\u2019s hair, thereby streamlining the styling process.</p> \n<p>In essence, hair wax sticks are designed to act as \u201clipstick for hair,\u201d providing swift styling results by taming flyaways and managing frizz. They also\u00a0 effectively address the issue of avoiding greasy or sticky hands typically associated with traditional hair wax usage.</p> \n<p>While the concept of hair wax has been around since ancient times, with evidence of early forms like beeswax used inGaulandEgypt, the modern incarnation as a hair wax stick has only recently gained momentum. The recent surge in popularity of hair wax sticks can be closely linked to the influence of viral TikTok videos.</p> \n<p>This correlation is evidenced by data fromGlimpse, a trends discovery website, and Google Ads Keyword analysis. Glimpse has tracked a steady increase in monthly searches for hair wax sticks since April 2022, culminating in year-on-year growth of over 130% by January 2024, with monthly search volumes surpassing 20,000 in December 2023.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Google Ads Keyword analysis reveals an even more pronounced trend, showing an average monthly search volume of 78,000 for \u201chair wax sticks\u201d throughout 2023 and a notable, consistent increase starting from August 2023. These growing interests align with the release timeline of severalpopular TikTok videos reviewing and testing hair wax sticks.</p> \n<h2>Guide to choosing the right hair wax stick</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s important for wholesalers to stock a range of hair wax sticks suitable for different hair types. For instance, lighter wax may be more suitable for individuals with fine or thin hair as it doesn\u2019t weigh down the strands and promotes a natural look. Meanwhile, those with thick or coarse hair may require a heavier wax for more increased control.</p> \n<p>Ingredients used in hair wax sticks is another pivotal consideration when determining their saleability, with consumers increasingly looking for a blend of natural ingredients. Avocado oil, for example, rich in vitamins and fatty acids, is a common ingredient that moisturizes and adds shine, counteracting dryness from styling and frizz, while the antioxidant vitamin E protects and nourishes hair, guarding against UV rays and pollution while reducing frizz. In addition, castor seed oil promotes hair strength and growth.</p> \n<p>Kaolin clay is often the key ingredient that helps with texture and volume. Complementing these benefits, ingredients such as shea butter can provide hydration and a healthy sheen, which is particularly useful for dry or brittle hair. Lastly, beeswax, the most common ingredient in hair wax sticks, is the key to solidifying hold, ensuring styles remain firmly in place. It\u2019s generally recommended to steer clear of waxes laden with sulfates, parabens, or other harsh chemicals that can strip hair of its natural oils.</p> \n<p>In conclusion, different waxes are designed to work best with different hairstyles. For a polished, shiny appearance, such as a slicked-back style, a wax stick with a strong hold and glossy finish is often recommended. Conversely, for a relaxed, beachy texture, a matte-finish wax offering medium hold is ideal to allow for natural hair movement.</p> \n<h2>Common varieties of hair wax sticks</h2> \n<h3>Edge control formulas</h3> \n<p>In effect, all hair wax sticks offer a certain level of edge control.

Such masks are hypoallergenic, meaning they won\u2019t irritate the skin. And they can hold a good amount of serum when consumers wear them for their beauty routines.</p> \n<p>Cotton facial masksare also very soft. In addition to fitting well on the face, they\u2019re incredibly breathable, allowing air and moisture to move freely. That way, the skin will stay moisturized and comfortable while the sheet mask is on.</p> \n<p>Speaking more on their hypoallergenic properties,cotton facial maskshave a soothing effect on the skin, making them ideal for calming irritated or inflamed skin.

Although the craze has since died down, hydrogel remains one of the best materials for facial sheet masks.</p> \n<p>Whilehydrogelis not a natural material, manufacturers combine natural polymers, including water, glycerin, and hydrocolloids, to make the material. This combination gives it the famous gel-like structure that gives the skin deep hydration and nourishment.</p> \n<p>Typically,hydrogel masksare highly absorbent (way more than cotton). So they can soak up all the serum, preventing it from running down or evaporating easily. Their porous nature also ensures they effectively deliver active ingredients to the skin.</p> \n<p>Speaking of active ingredients,hydrogel masksare often infused with hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, green tea extracts, and Vitamin C/E.

For this reason, biocellulose masks easily deliver maximum results to every inch of the skin.</p> \n<p>These masks also have the best moisture retention.Biocellulose maskscan hold serums (or water) up to 100 times their weight, making them an excellent material for dry skin.

However, they offer special properties when used infacial masks, which is one of the reasons why consumers love them.</p> \n<p>Charcoal masksare quite different from other facial masks. Instead of washing or peeling off easily, they cling to the skin, helping to pull out blackheads, hair, dead skin, and other pore-clogging criminals. Charcoal masks are also the best options for detoxifying the skin\u2019s surface.</p> \n<p>However,these masksare not the best for consumers with sensitive skin or certain conditions. Sometimes, they can cause excessive skin peeling, resulting in very painful experiences or permanent skin damage.</p> \n<p>Regardless, active charcoal\u2019s ability to absorb toxins and bacteria from the skin makes it one of the best ingredients for face masks.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Facial masks didn\u2019t start as an essential beauty product. Some people saw them as uncomfortable due to their non-woven fabric history, and consumers had to lie down to use them effectively. However, the market changed after 2009 saw the first hydrogel mask hit the shelves.</p> \n<p>Now, a huge chunk of people love facial masks due to the material variety\u2014they\u2019re also starting the year with 110000 searches (based on Google Ads). The five top ones to grab in 2024 include cotton, hydrogel, Tencel, biocellulose, and charcoal facial masks.</p> \n"}]}

Anticipated within the fragmented market structure, the market size is projected to increase by USD 8.38 billion from 2024 to 2028. In this blog, we will delve into the key drivers, trends, and challenges shaping the face wash market, providing valuable insights for businesses looking to capitalize on this burgeoning market.</p> \n<p>Formulated to be mild and gentle, face washes are crafted to cleanse the skin effectively without depleting its natural oils or causing irritation. The growing preference for natural and organic face washes reflects an escalating health awareness among consumers of personal care products worldwide. Additionally, the rising global population of working women, who often invest more in personal care items, contributes to the increasing demand for face washes, propelling the global market throughout the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>Face Wash Market: Key Drivers, Trends, and Challenges</h2> \n<p>Our researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis using 2023 as the baseline, exploring key drivers, trends, and challenges within the face wash market. A thorough examination of the drivers aims to assist companies in refining their marketing strategies to gain a competitive edge.</p> \n<p>Market growth is significantly propelled by the increasing per capita income and evolving purchase behavior. The rise in disposable income, particularly in developing countries, is a primary factor, with China experiencing a notable 13.7% increase in disposable per capita income for Q1 of 2021 compared to the previous year. This heightened financial freedom enables consumers to allocate more funds to non-essential goods like face wash. Emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region witness shifts in consumer purchasing habits, driven by factors such as high discretionary income, widespread brand availability, and diverse product offerings on online platforms, all contributing to the global face wash market\u2019s expansion.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, developed countries like the US demonstrate relative growth in disposable personal income, fostering increased consumer spending on face wash despite higher prices. Notably, the inclination of working women to invest more in personal care products is a global trend propelling the face wash market during the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The growing preference for organic face washes is an emerging trend influencing market growth. Increased health consciousness among global consumers of personal care products has driven demand for natural and organic face washes. Skin-related concerns, such as irritations, allergies, and dark marks, have fueled the desire for face washes devoid of synthetic ingredients.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers are responding by prioritizing the production of natural and organic face washes, often incorporating plant extracts, natural oils, and ingredients like sunflower oil, jojoba oil, aloe vera, turmeric, and olive oil. This focus on natural and organic options helps differentiate products, instills consumer trust, and is expected to drive the global market in the forecast period.</p> \n<p>A significant challenge hampering market growth is the widespread availability of counterfeit products, particularly through e-commerce platforms. The influx of counterfeit goods poses a threat to major vendors, impacting sales and tarnishing the goodwill and image of established manufacturers. The low production cost of counterfeit personal care products, including face wash, is a key factor driving their proliferation, often resulting in contamination with petrochemicals and harmful chemicals during manufacturing.</p> \n<p>Consumers, especially in APAC countries like China, India, and Thailand, as well as Middle Eastern countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, are susceptible to misleading packaging and product names that mimic established brands. Consequently, the presence of counterfeit products is anticipated to negatively affect genuine vendors\u2019 profit margins and impede the overall growth of the global face wash market during the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>What are the Largest-Growing Segments in the Face Wash Market</h2> \n<p>The online segment is estimated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. Personal care products, including face wash, are mostly sold through the online distribution channel, which includes e-commerce platforms, company websites, and online retailers. The shift towards online sales of personal care products, including face wash, has been driven by various factors such as the increasing prevalence of e-commerce, changing consumer shopping habits, and the convenience offered by online shopping.</p> \n<p>The online segment was the largest and was valued at USD 16.88 billion in 2023. Consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms to purchase personal care products due to the ease of browsing and comparing products, access to a wide range of options, and the convenience of doorstep delivery. E-commerce platforms provide a convenient and time-saving alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores, allowing consumers to shop from the comfort of their homes.</p> \n<p>In addition to e-commerce platforms, many personal care brands and manufacturers have their own official websites where consumers can directly purchase products. This direct-to-consumer approach enables brands to establish a closer relationship with their customers, gather valuable feedback, and offer exclusive promotions or discounts. Overall, the online distribution channel has become a significant and growing avenue for the sale of personal care products, with face wash being a notable category benefiting from the convenience and accessibility offered by online platforms. Such factors are expected to increase the adoption of online channels for face wash, which will propel the growth of the market focus during the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The face wash market is on a trajectory of robust growth, driven by rising disposable incomes, changing consumer behaviors, and a growing preference for natural and organic products. However, challenges such as the proliferation of counterfeit products pose a threat to market integrity and vendor profitability. The online distribution channel is emerging as a significant driver of sales, offering convenience and a wide range of options to consumers. As the market continues to evolve, companies must adapt their strategies to navigate the changing landscape and leverage the opportunities presented by this dynamic industry. With a keen understanding of market drivers, trends, and challenges, businesses can position themselves for success in the face wash market during the forecast period of 2024-2028.</p> \n"}]}

But not everyone has the time or ability to visit amassage therapist.</p> \n<p>However, consumers don\u2019t have to make expensive trips for deep-feet relaxation. They can get the same experience from the comfort of their home with afoot massager! Since they can use and enjoy it anytime they want, consumers can enjoy even more benefits and keep their bodies in peak shape after the daily grind.</p> \n<p>Mostelectric foot massagerscome with adjustable intensity, allowing users to achieve their desired comfort level. Foot massagers may also require an outlet or batteries to run. So, if target consumers are always on the go, businesses can offer models with longer battery lives (that are also compact/lightweight).</p> \n<p>One\u2019s feet do need some attention, and many people agree with this sentiment. Google Ads data shows that foot massagers average 555000 searches monthly\u2014and that value increased to 825000 in January 2024.</p> \n<h3>Massage chairs</h3> \n<p>A stressful day might see consumers wanting more than a foot massage. What many turn to in such situations is a full-body massage. That\u2019s wheremassage chairsenter the spotlight.</p> \n<p>Massage chairsare advanced pieces of equipment that mimic the movements of human hands, allowing them to perform various massage techniques, like shiatsu, kneading, rolling, and tapping. In addition to the inner components that make the massage experience possible, these chairs also come with paddings and ergonomic features to keep users comfortable and relaxed.</p> \n<p>The best part is consumers can select and customize theirmassage type, speed, and intensity to target specific body areas or enjoy the full-body experience. And if users don\u2019t want to set it themselves, many massage chairs come with pre-programmed massage sequences.</p> \n<p>These modelsmerge various intensities, techniques, and durations into single sessions, catering to specific preferences like \u201cFull-Body Relaxation\u201d and \u201cBack Pain Relief.\u201d These pre-programmed options allow users to enjoy various massage experiences without manual adjustments\u2014they\u2019re also customizable!</p> \n<p>Massage chairs are the second most popular trend on this list and are hot items now! According to Google Ads data, their search interest boosted by 40%, reaching 450000 inquiries in January 2024 from 301000 in November 2023.</p> \n<h3>Foam rollers</h3> \n<p>Although electric massagers dominate the market, manual variants are not yet out of the picture! One that still holds \u201ctrending\u201d status in 2024 is the trustyfoam roller. Starting the year with 246000 searches (based on Google Ads data), foam rollers don\u2019t seem to be dying out anytime soon.</p> \n<p>Although they\u2019re basically large cylinders made of solid foam,these massagersare the go-to option for relieving tight muscles. Manufacturers make them in different sizes and firmness levels, with many easily handling large muscle groups.</p> \n<p>Some consumers usefoam rollersas a quick solution to after-workout soreness. But others add foam rolling as a warm-up routine to loosen sore muscles before exercising. Foam rollers can come with smooth surfaces or have ridges and knobs (the latter is multifunctional).</p> \n<h3>Neck massagers</h3> \n<p>Although the neck supports the head, it\u2019s not immune to tension.

Models with rechargeable batteries offer attention-grabbing freedom that is impossible with corded variants.</p> \n<p>These massagers have experienced tremendous growth recently. Google Ads data shows that they started 2023 with 90500 searches, dropped to 49500 mid-way through the year, but closed the year with 165000 searches in December (an impressive 100% boost).</p> \n<p>However, that doesn\u2019t compare to their 246000 searches in January 2024, representing a staggering 120% interest growth! Seems like 2024 is looking like a great year for neck massagers.</p> \n<h3>Handheld massagers</h3> \n<p>When it comes to all-around targeted massages, nothing beatshandheld massagers. These handy tools offer convenience and comfort with designs targeting different tense muscles and specific muscle parts with high-intensity and deep-pressure massages.</p> \n<p>Since they\u2019re handheld, consumers can reach even the tightest corners of the body.

Paper makes perfect: the rise of eco-friendly materials</h2> \n<p>In the quest for sustainability, the beauty industry is turning to paper-based packaging solutions that are both eco-friendly and innovative. Advances in monomaterials, which facilitate recycling, and the use of alternative fibers such as hemp, algae, and recycled content, are pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with paper.

Although it sounds concerning, these holes are so small that they\u2019re invisible to the human eye and are not painful.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, these devices are so popular because the micro-injuries they cause can kickstart elastin and collagen production. The results? A plumper and tighter complexion, with no wrinkles or puffiness to be seen.</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global derma roller market</h2> \n<p>According to reports, theglobal derma roller marketreached US $328 million in 2022, with predictions to hit US $560 million by the end of 2030, registering a 7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The market owes its expansion to the rising demand for skin care tools among beauty-conscious customers, who are mostly middle-aged women within the young baby boomers and Generation X. The surge in demand for these tools among middle-aged women and those with rising disposable income is also boosting market growth.</p> \n<p>Specialty stores captured a huge chunk of the global derma rollers market in 2024, and experts predict it will continue holding the largest share over the forecast period. Asia-Pacific also emerged as the largest regional market, while North America follows behind as the fastest-growing region.</p> \n<h2>Do derma rollers help stimulate hair growth?</h2> \n<p>Derma rollerscan stimulate growth in the same way they help rejuvenate the skin. These devices puncture the scalp with tiny needles, pushing it to create more collagen/elastin and circulate blood to the hair follicles.</p> \n<p>Moreso, these devices are ideal for improving nutrient delivery and tropical treatment effectiveness. The microscopic holes serve as channels, creating an easy way for serums and oils to penetrate deeply into the skin. For this reason, many see derma rollers as remarkable, non-invasive hair loss treatment options.</p> \n<h2>4 factors to consider before investing in derma rollers</h2> \n<h3>1. Choose the right needle length</h3> \n<p>Derma rollersoffer different needle lengths, ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 mm. Moreover, choosing the best needle length mostly depends on the target consumer\u2019s goals. Here\u2019s a table showing the different needle lengths and why users may need them.</p> \n<h3>2. Consider the consumer\u2019s skin condition</h3> \n<p>Various skin conditions can push consumers towardderma rollers. But the thing is, the skin condition they\u2019re hoping to fix also determines the needle length they\u2019ll need. So, businesses must understand their target audience\u2019s needs before offering these tools.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the common skin conditions that derma rollers can help fix:</p> \n<p>For treating scars and acne,derma rollersare highly effective. They accelerate the skin\u2019s repair processes, increasing the likelihood of scar healing without leaving permanent marks.</p> \n<p>The recommended needle length for acne scars is 0.75 to 1 mm, while deeper scars may require 1.5 mm. Larger-sized rollers (1.5 mm and above) are suggested for treating scars on areas other than the face.</p> \n<p>With a 0.5-mm-lengthderma roller, consumers can address wrinkles and fine lines. They effectively enhance skin elasticity, helping to conceal wrinkles and prevent discoloration.</p> \n<p>Derma rollers(especially ones with 0.5 mm and below needle lengths) effectively reduce hyperpigmentation, breaking up the melanin clusters causing the issue. These sizes will also enhance skin-lightening cream absorption, helping to quicken results.</p> \n<p>Stretch marks are deeper than regular scars, meaning they\u2019ll need bigger needles (1.5 mm to 2.0 mm) for a fix. These rollers can increase the skin\u2019s derma layer thickness, slowly eliminating the marks and smoothing the area.</p> \n<p>Consumers who want to fix hair loss issues need 0.5- to 1.0-mm rollers. These rollers can easily stimulate the scalp enough to boost hair growth.</p> \n<p>Dermarolling is the go-to treatment for combating enlarged pores, as it stimulates collagen production. This process tightens and plumps up enlarged pores, effectively reducing their size. However, consumers won\u2019t need any more than 0.5 mm rollers to correct enlarged pores.</p> \n<h3>3. Prioritize high-quality materials</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers equip theirderma rollerswith tiny needles made from stainless steel or titanium. Although both materials are incredible, most consumers prefer titanium needles for their longevity and durability.</p> \n<p>And, if consumers want stainless steel needles, prioritize derma rollers with medical-grade ones for the best experience.</p> \n<h3>4. Factor in how often consumers will use them</h3> \n<p>Eachmicroneedlesize requires a different use frequency. Generally, smaller needles mean consumers can use dermarolling more often, while the opposite happens for larger ones.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Undoubtedly,derma rollershave become one of the most popular skincare tools in 2023. In truth, they garnered 450,000 searches in November alone, proving how widespread the device is in the beauty market.</p> \n<p>Whether it\u2019s smoothing fine lines, encouraging hair growth, pushing serums into the skin, or minimizing scar visibility, derma rollers can do it all.</p> \n<p>However, the derma roller\u2019s size determines how quick the results will be. Smaller models (0.20 to 1.0 mm) won\u2019t cause bleeding and will offer mostly painless procedures. However, bigger ones (1.5 mm and higher) may cause bleeding but provide faster results.</p> \n<p>Remember these tips when purchasing derma rollers to curate the best skin care offers in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

The allure of exclusivity in luxury</h2> \n<p>Exclusivity has always been a cornerstone of luxury, but ultra-luxe takes this to new heights. It\u2019s about creating products and experiences so unique that they are only accessible to a select few. This exclusivity is achieved through limited editions, bespoke services, and by ensuring that every aspect of the product or service is meticulously crafted to meet the individual desires of the consumer. The allure lies in the knowledge that one possesses something utterly unique, enhancing the luxury experience.</p> \n<h2>3. Artisan craftsmanship and bespoke services</h2> \n<p>The essence of ultra-luxury lies in its commitment to craftsmanship and bespoke services. Artisanal techniques, passed down through generations, are at the heart of creating products that exude quality and rarity. Personalization elevates the consumer experience, transforming luxury items into personal heirlooms that reflect the individual\u2019s taste and desires. This emphasis on handcrafted excellence and customization not only enriches the product\u2019s value but also strengthens the emotional connection between the brand and its clientele.</p> \n<h2>4. The role of storytelling in ultra-luxe branding</h2> \n<p>Storytelling is a powerful tool in ultra-luxe branding, imbuing products with meaning and heritage. It\u2019s about crafting narratives that resonate with consumers, connecting them to the brand\u2019s legacy, values, and the meticulous process behind each creation. This narrative dimension adds depth to the luxury experience, inviting consumers into a world where every product has a story to tell, enhancing the allure and perceived value of ultra-luxe items.</p> \n<h2>5. Navigating regional preferences for ultra-luxury</h2> \n<p>Understanding regional preferences is crucial for ultra-luxe brands to resonate with global audiences. Different cultures and markets have unique perceptions of luxury, which influences their purchasing behavior. Tailoring offerings to meet these specific tastes and values ensures that brands can connect more deeply with consumers, whether through culturally inspired designs, exclusive local collaborations, or region-specific services. This localization of ultra-luxury not only enhances brand relevance but also allows for a more personalized consumer experience.</p> \n<h2>6. Strategies for brands to capitalize on the ultra-luxe opportunity</h2> \n<p>To succeed in the ultra-luxe segment, brands must focus on differentiation through exceptional quality, exclusivity, and storytelling. Building strong relationships with consumers through personalized experiences and impeccable service is key. Additionally, leveraging digital technology to offer bespoke services and immersive storytelling can further enhance the luxury experience. Brands should also consider sustainability and ethical practices as part of their value proposition, appealing to the growing consumer demand for responsible luxury.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The ultra-luxe market presents a significant opportunity for brands willing to push the boundaries of luxury. By focusing on artisan craftsmanship, bespoke services, compelling storytelling, and understanding regional preferences, brands can create unparalleled experiences that resonate with consumers. As we look towards 2025, the brands that succeed in embodying these values will redefine luxury, setting new standards for exclusivity and personalization in the industry.</p> \n"}]}

Positioned as the ultimate beauty investment, these tools go beyond mere functionality, becoming indispensable components of a self-care routine. The key allure lies in their characteristic features\u2014they are not only endlessly reusable, embodying sustainability and conscious consumption, but they also manifest as aesthetically pleasing objects, adding a touch of elegance to daily rituals. These tools are envisioned as more than utilitarian; they serve as beautiful artifacts that spark inspiration, transforming the beauty routine into a holistic and indulgent experience. As consumers seek to pamper themselves with accessible yet luxurious products, this trend reflects a deeper desire for self-care, well-being, and a touch of everyday opulence.</p> \n<p>In response to the dynamic shifts in the beauty and lifestyle industry, brands are increasingly prioritizing the consumer experience. This strategic focus aligns with the prevailing trend of regarding beauty tools as accessible luxuries. Beyond mere practicality, brands now emphasize the creation of visually appealing, sustainable, and reusable tools, intending to elevate these items into cherished possessions that contribute to holistic self-care rituals. This strategic shift mirrors the industry\u2019s broader trend of delivering a comprehensive and indulgent experience, ensuring that every facet of the consumer\u2019s beauty journey is not only memorable but also deeply satisfying. Tactile hedonism takes center stage as beauty tools seamlessly integrate texture with function, heightening satisfaction for Skintentional consumers.</p> \n<p>An illustrative example is Fara Homidi\u2019s Pochette makeup bag, meticulously handcrafted from a luxurious leather alternative, progressively softening with each use. Another notable instance is seen in the Swiss makeup brush brand Sonia G., which unveiled a Mount Fuji-inspired powder brush and brush holder handcrafted in Japan using traditional yosegi and kumiko woodworking techniques. These examples underscore the industry\u2019s commitment to offering products that blend practicality, aesthetics, and cultural significance for an enriched consumer experience.</p> \n<h2>Embracing Guilt-Free Indulgence and Anti-Wellness Rituals</h2> \n<p>In the realm of guilt-free indulgence and empathetic anti-wellness rituals, consumers grappling with heightened burnout levels are seeking therapeutic solace in the pleasures of laziness. Anti-wellness practices, such as the art of \u2018bed-rotting,\u2019 are poised for an upgrade through beauty products designed to enhance relaxation or encourage the embrace of \u2018doing nothing.\u2019 Care/of (US) exemplifies this ethos with its \u2018Do Less, Feel More\u2019 digital campaign, urging its community to adopt a less-is-more mentality for New Year resolutions.</p> \n<p>In this landscape, the demand for products that deliver more with minimal effort becomes pivotal. Petitfee, a South Korean brand, introduces moisturizing hand and foot sheet masks, seamlessly wearable during sleep, embodying the essence of effortless self-care. Further, the integration of mindful experiences or treatments that harmonize with products gains prominence. Neom Organics (UK) presents Wellbeing Pods, enhancing the \u2018ultimate hibernation mode\u2019 through a breathing guide, providing consumers with a holistic and understanding approach to self-care in the midst of their hectic lives.</p> \n<p>Aligned with this trend, the ascent of anti-wellness and chaotic beauty behaviors becomes evident, as consumers deliberately indulge in \u2018bad\u2019 habits as a nihilistic means of embracing the present moment. Brands can support these habits by offering robust formulations that aid recovery, as seen in Youthforia\u2019s (US) Date Night Skin Tint Serum Foundation, dermatologist-tested for safe overnight wear. To act on this trend effectively, the market will see a surge in products promoting relaxation and recovery, featuring sensorial elements or thoughtful formulations. Consumers seek a judgment-free and supportive narrative that resonates with their overwhelmed mindset. Monster Code, a Korean brand, addresses this with its Copper Peptide Midnight Oil, specifically designed for users who prefer late-night rituals.</p> \n<h2>Dark Comforts \u2013 Beauty in Complexity</h2> \n<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of beauty, a captivating trend emerges \u2014 \u201cDark Comforts,\u201d a paradigm shift born from the Mindful Nihilism trends. This trend navigates beauty narratives into uncharted territories, embracing themes that provide an unexpected sense of solace. As society wearies from the relentless promotion of happiness, consumers now seek beauty products and brands that serve as allies in the exploration and processing of complex emotions, fostering resilience and self-discovery. Within this trend, stimulating products act as conduits for profound contemplation, utilising unconventional fragrances, spellbinding tonalities, and surrealist aesthetics. \u201cDark Comforts\u201d delves into the intersection of pleasure and pain, encouraging consumers to find glimmers of beauty in the complexity of their emotions. In this section, we delve into the key elements and products that define this trend, unraveling the allure of dark aesthetics and the rebellion against conventional beauty standards.</p> \n<p>To implement this trend effectively, incorporating dark aesthetics and surrealist themes becomes essential to cultivate a sense of agency and rebellion against increasingly unattainable beauty standards. This aesthetic shift permeates color cosmetics, as seen in Isamaya Beauty\u2019s Industrial Colour Pigments palette. This palette boasts latex-inspired three-dimensional packaging and a mix of sooty and cosmic eye pigments, encouraging an anti-perfectionist approach to application. Stimulating products become catalysts for deeper contemplation, infusing goosebump-inducing fragrances with rich notes, including unconventional bodily scents or deep, sensual ouds. Akro\u2019s (UK) \u201cSmoke,\u201d described as a \u201ctaboo aroma,\u201d draws inspiration from the unique pleasure associated with the first drag of a cigarette.</p> \n<p>In the realm of \u201cDark Comforts,\u201d an evolution from our Mindful Nihilism trends, beauty narratives delve into themes that offer an unexpected sense of solace. In a society fatigued with the constant promotion of happiness, consumers are now drawn to products and brands that facilitate the processing of complex emotions, fostering resilience and knowledge. Born to Stand Out, a K-fragrance brand contributes to this trend with its \u201cSin & Pleasure\u201d scent, inspired by the notion that \u201cpleasure is sin, and sin is pleasure.\u201d This fragrance encapsulates the exploration of complex emotions, offering a dark and comforting olfactory experience for those seeking depth and nuance in their beauty rituals.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion:</h2> \n<p>In the ever-evolving beauty landscape, consumers are actively pursuing indulgence through products that go beyond mere functionality, transforming into symbols of affordable opulence. Retailers stand poised to capitalize on this trend by skillfully curating collections that seamlessly blend sustainability, aesthetics, and cultural significance.

One such trend that has caught their attention is EMS sculpting.</p> \n<p>This technology offers a non-invasive treatment to shape, tone, and firm the body. For this reason, it\u2019s becoming a popular option for customers searching for safe and effective ways to enhance their physique. This means sellers can leverage this trend by offering the best EMS sculpting machines.</p> \n<p>Read on to learn how to select the best EMS sculpting machines for salon owners in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsEMS Sculpting: what is this new trend?How do EMS sculpting machines work?5 key considerations when selecting EMS sculpting machinesFinal words</p> \n<h2>EMS Sculpting: what is this new trend?</h2> \n<p>EMS sculptingis a new way consumers can shape their bodies without surgery. It uses special technology to make the muscles contract strongly, helping build and reduce fat for a more toned and sculpted physique.</p> \n<p>This procedure differs from regular workouts because it triggers powerful contractions that are impossible with regular exercise. Many consumers prefer using them to boost their fitness or kick-start their journey to a fitter body.</p> \n<p>The best part isEMS sculptingdoesn\u2019t have any recovery time. It\u2019s another reason many clients hold it in high regard\u2014they don\u2019t have to prepare for the treatment or follow any expensive post-care plan.</p> \n<p>Although some clients may experience mild soreness, it\u2019s nothing compared to the pain from regular workouts. But there\u2019s more. Results from this procedure can last anywhere from six months to a year. Consumers only have to maintain a healthy lifestyle, preferably with a good diet and regular exercise.</p> \n<h3>Is EMS sculpting safe?</h3> \n<p>EMS sculpting machinesare the first FDA-approved energy devices for building muscle mass and burning fat. Up to seven independent US-based clinical studies evaluated these machines and generated the following results from healthy patients on average:</p> \n<p>Note: Clients with metal implants near the sculpting area may be at higher risk.</p> \n<h2>How do EMS sculpting machines work?</h2> \n<p>EMS sculpting machinestarget electromagnetic energy on muscle areas, pushing them to contract at 100% capacity and keeping them in that state for six seconds. Such feats are impossible with regular exercises, as the average person can only contract their muscles at 35% capacity.</p> \n<p>The result of these contractions is the muscle adapting and reconstructing itself, eliminating the fat cells in the target area and creating a better build. In addition, the process doesn\u2019t cause pain or discomfort\u2014clients will only feel a pulling sensation. However, aestheticians will always perform these procedures at comfortable levels for their clients.</p> \n<h3>Can EMS work at home?</h3> \n<p>Yes! Businesses can also focus marketing efforts on consumers who want to enjoy EMS sculpting at home. In fact, various at-homeEMS devicesare flooding the market, ranging from simple muscle stimulators to more advanced full-body suits.</p> \n<h2>5 key considerations when selecting EMS sculpting machines</h2> \n<h3>Effectiveness and technology</h3> \n<p>EMS sculpting machinesare only as good as the technologies they feature. One of the best tech to look for in these units is high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology. Currently, it is the most advanced and effective EMS technology for inducing powerful muscle contractions.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, someEMS sculpting machinescan come with awesome tech combos, like HIFEM with RF. Machines with the HIFEM-RF technology combo also deliver heat while causing muscles to contract. Undoubtedly, the extra heat helps stimulate fat cell death and promotes collagen production, resulting in instant face-lifting effects.</p> \n<p>Note: HIFEM-RF EMS machines are not as effective as their non-combo counterparts. While they have the added benefit of tighter, smoother skin for faces, they won\u2019t help for other muscle areas.</p> \n<h3>Safety features</h3> \n<p>Like every other unit,EMS sculpting machinesmust have the necessary safety features to prevent accidents. Things can easily go sideways if EMS units don\u2019t have features like automatic shut-off and overcurrent protection.</p> \n<p>Automatic shut-off ensures theEMS machinesstop after a certain period. It helps prevent excessive muscle stimulation, reduces the fatigue and discomfort risk, and promotes responsible usage.</p> \n<p>Overcurrent protection is crucial as it helps monitor and control the electrical currents transmitted to the muscles. This safety feature acts as a safeguard, keeping things safe in the event of a surge that could lead to injury.</p> \n<p>Lastly, sellers must ensure their prospective manufacturers have approval from relevant health and safety authorities, like the FDA.</p> \n<h3>Ease of use</h3> \n<p>EMS sculpting machinesmust be easy enough for the average user to understand and use. Hence, sellers should focus on machines with user-friendly interfaces and controls. Intuitive designs make navigating different settings and programs easier, ensuring a hassle-free workout experience.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, some consumers may still consider EMS units \u201ccomplex to operate.\u201d So, in addition to user-friendly designs, retailers must choose manufacturers that offer ongoing support and comprehensive training. It ensures buyers can use the machine safely and effectively without asking for refunds.</p> \n<h3>Portability and design</h3> \n<p>These considerations are more relevant for sellers targeting at-home users. Bigger, salon-gradeEMS machinesdon\u2019t need to be moved around often, so they don\u2019t need portability.</p> \n<p>However, those planning to use EMS devices at home or take them to different locations will prefer compact and lightweight designs. Additionally, the machine should also be easy to store.</p> \n<h3>Comfort and fit</h3> \n<p>Although intense muscle stimulation can be uncomfortable, the rightEMS machineshould never be painful. However, the best way to ensure salons offer a comfortable experience is by stocking up on units with adjustable intensity levels, allowing each client to receive a personalized EMS session.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all.\u00a0 Also, check for other parts influencing themachine\u2019scomfort, like the electrode pads or belts. The pads should be comfortable to wear, and the belts should have a snug fit\u2014these will help avoid any discomfort during the procedure.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>People keep finding new, non-invasive ways to improve their bodies\u2014 and now, EMS sculpting is making waves in the beauty and fitness scene. However, choosing the rightEMS sculpting machineis the only way to convert inquisitive buyers into paying consumers.</p> \n<p>In order to do this retailers can consider the factors discussed in this article when stocking up on EMS sculpting machines. They\u2019ll help sellers make informed investment decisions that benefit salon owners and at-home users.</p> \n"}]}

This meant people had to go under the needle to achieve their desired lift or to handle certainskin conditions.</p> \n<p>However, the era of non-surgical cosmetic procedures ushered in fantastic solutions that offer similar results, but without the uncomfortable process and its hefty price tag. And one notable non-surgical procedure is mesotherapy.</p> \n<p>But, before diving into the different mesotherapy devices to sell in 2024, businesses must first understand the concept of this beauty procedure and what it can do.</p> \n<p>This article will explore everything sellers need to know before entering this market in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMesotherapy: What is this beauty procedure?What are the benefits of mesotherapy?Top mesotherapy devices to stock in 2024Does the aesthetic treatment have any side effects?Wrapping up</p> \n<h2>Mesotherapy: What is this beauty procedure?</h2> \n<p>Introduced by Dr. Michel Pistor in 1952, mesotherapy is an effective rejuvenating technique that injects a cocktail of vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes, and plant extracts through microneedles. This technique works on the middle layer of the skin, making it similar to acupuncture.</p> \n<p>Depending on the injection technique, one can choose between three types of mesotherapy: point-by-point, upper skin, and comprehensive mesotherapy. Some technicians also classify mesotherapy based on application area\u2014which means that one can get hair mesotherapy, body mesotherapy, and mesolifting.</p> \n<p>Mesolipo is another form of mesotherapy that targets body fat. Although less potent than surgical liposuction, mesolipo uses natural, active fat-reduction ingredients to stimulate fat metabolism.</p> \n<h3>What is needle-free mesotherapy?</h3> \n<p>While mesotherapy procedures typically involve needles, not everyone can handle the little punctures. For this reason, needle-free mesotherapy became a huge hit, as technicians use ultrasonic machines to inject drug mixtures into the middle skin layer without microneedles.</p> \n<p>But how does this happen? The ultrasonic machine pushes the cell membrane from a semi-permeable state into a fully permeable one for a short time, allowing the skin to absorb the liquid treatment.</p> \n<p>Although needle-free mesotherapy has less successful results than their needle variants, it\u2019s still an amazing alternative for people sensitive to needles.</p> \n<h2>What are the benefits of mesotherapy?</h2> \n<p>Mesotherapy offers various benefits. For starters, the beauty procedure instantly improves dull, tired-looking skin and straightens superficial wrinkles. It can also help boost blood circulation and help the body remove aging toxins.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s only the start. Mesotherapy can also help consumers treat hyperpigmentation, acne, and \u201clit-from-within\u201d skin glow. The vitamin cocktail popular with mesotherapy can also stimulate the skin to produce more collagen\u2014making it an effective way to combat various aging signs.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s an interesting fact: typically, mesotherapy cocktails can contain over 50 active ingredients, all helping to nourish, rejuvenate, and repair the skin.</p> \n<h2>Top mesotherapy devices to stock in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Mesotherapy gun</h3> \n<p>Mesotherapy gunsare handheld devices that deliver vitamin cocktails to the skin through multiple fine needles, allowing for precise and even distribution. Manufacturers design these devices to minimize discomfort and maximize efficiency during the procedure.</p> \n<p>Typically,mesotherapy gunsfeature adjustable needle depths and injection rates, allowing practitioners to customize the treatment to each patient\u2019s needs. These guns also use controlled pressure systems to ensure accurate and consistent injected substance delivery.</p> \n<p>But, if consumers want something less invasive, they\u2019ll love needle-freemesotherapy guns. These non-invasive devices use electrical pulses to temporarily create tiny pores in the skin, allowing them to deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin.</p> \n<p>Mesotherapy gunsare the go-to devices for reducing cellulite, improving skin texture/elasticity, promoting hair growth, and reducing localized fat deposits. Although meso gun therapies are generally safe and well-tolerated, sellers should only offer the devices to trained/experienced professionals.</p> \n<h3>Mesotherapy needles</h3> \n<p>Mesotherapy needlesoffer the most basic way to apply mesotherapy procedures. Usually, they look like regular syringes with thin, short needles (typically ranging from 4mm to 13mm in length). However, some variants ditch the traditional design and use a pack of microneedles to inject various substances.</p> \n<p>These needles typically come from stainless steel, with their size depending on the area to be treated and the client\u2019s desired results.Mesotherapy needlesare also very thin, meaning they cause minimal discomfort during procedures.</p> \n<p>But unlike meso guns, usingmesotherapy needlesinvolves multiple injections in the affected area.</p> \n<h3>Dermal rollers</h3> \n<p>Dermal rollersoffer a different way to dish out mesotherapy cocktails. These handheld tools offer tiny needles that create controlled micro-injuries on the skin\u2019s surface, triggering the body\u2019s natural healing response and promoting collagen/elastin production.</p> \n<p>Whiledermal rollersare not technically the same as mesotherapy, they can help achieve similar results. For this reason, many practitioners consider them effective ways to infuse serums into the skin deeply.</p> \n<p>More importantly, despite micro-needling treatments being famous for targeting the skin\u2019s first layer, modern advancements have made it possible to target the middle layers (more common with mesotherapy) withdermal rollers.</p> \n<p>Unlike meso guns and needles,dermal rollersare consumer-friendly, meaning they don\u2019t need expert hands to use them effectively. So, businesses can offer them to at-home consumers to improve the appearance of the face, neck, and body.</p> \n<h2>Does the aesthetic treatment have any side effects?</h2> \n<p>Like any other cosmetic injection procedure, mesotherapy may have the following side effects (albeit in rare cases):</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Gone are the days when consumers had to visit surgeons for all cosmetic procedures. While the deeper cosmetic treatments (like liposuction and plastic surgery) still require surgical procedures, they\u2019re not the only way to achieve desired looks in this era.</p> \n<p>Consumers can now turn to treatments like mesotherapy to rejuvenate their skin, target excess fat, combat hair loss, and fix aging signs without breaking the bank for surgeries. Businesses can offer mesotherapy guns and needles to professionals qualified to handle this beauty procedure and dermal rollers for at-home use.</p> \n"}]}

However, some cases may see these dead cells overstay their welcome, resulting in consumers having flaky skin and an uneven texture.</p> \n<p>While that sounds like something out of a horror movie for beauty-focused individuals, it has an easy solution: exfoliation. Facial scrubs are one of the most popular (and effective) exfoliators available today.</p> \n<p>But with this immense popularity comes a scary variety that makes it tricky to choose the best ones for target consumers. Luckily, this article will shed some light on what businesses must look for when selecting facial scrubs in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsIs now a good time to enter the facial scrub market?3 factors to consider when purchasing facial scrubsDo consumers need other products with facial scrubs?Final words</p> \n<h2>Is now a good time to enter the facial scrub market?</h2> \n<p>According to reports, theglobal facial scrubmarket had a US $1.7 billion value in 2022. However, marketing experts project the market will touch US $2.8 billion by 2031, growing at a 5.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The market is booming due to rising awareness of the importance of skincare, the increasing popularity of natural and organic products, and the growing prevalence of DIY beauty.</p> \n<p>North America is the largest facial scrub market, followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. The increasing awareness of skincare benefits also drives the regional market\u2019s growth.</p> \n<h2>3 factors to consider when purchasing facial scrubs</h2> \n<h3>1. Mode of action (type)</h3> \n<p>Exfoliation is simple. All it does is give the skin a nudge to shed skin cells faster and more efficiently. But unlike other physical exfoliants,face scrubscombine abrasion and chemical ingredients to provide the best results.</p> \n<p>The physical side offace scrubshelps smooth the skin instantly by focusing on the visible skin layers. They often contain abrasive materials, like ground apricots, sand, and silicone microbeads, that require interaction and friction to rid the skin of flakiness or uneven texture.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the chemical side targets the deeper layers of the skin while consumers scrub. These ingredients add antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and collagen-boosting benefits to face scrubs, allowing them to accommodate different skin types.</p> \n<p>However, if target consumers want more of the scrubbing action, businesses can stock up on more physical-focused face scrubs. While consumers who focus more on ingredients in their beauty products will gravitate toward scrubs that combine physical and chemical exfoliants.</p> \n<h3>2. Consumer\u2019s skin type</h3> \n<p>The consumer\u2019s skin type is the most important aspect when stocking up on facial scrubs. Although manufacturers don\u2019t labelfacial scrubsaccording to skin compatibility, some are more appropriate for certain skin types. For instance, consumers with sensitive skin can\u2019t use the same face scrubs as those with oily skin.</p> \n<p>Dry skin needs water-soluble ingredients, while oily skin prefers oil-soluble ingredients in beauty products. Someface scrubstarget aging signs and acne effectively, too. So, knowing the target consumer\u2019s skin type can help sellers pick the right scrub for them.</p> \n<h3>3. Product\u2019s concentration</h3> \n<p>Like coffee, everyface scrubhas strength. Consumers with sensitive skin prefer mild scrubs, while those with more tolerant skin prefer stronger exfoliants. Remember that face scrubs combine physical and chemical exfoliants, meaning they have concentration levels for each side.</p> \n<p>The type of exfoliant used in scrubs determines their physical contraction. For instance, perfectly round jojoba beads are mild, while exfoliants like crushed pumice, sand, and sugar are strong.</p> \n<p>Facial scrubchemical concentration is more straightforward. The more chemical percentages the formula has, the stronger the effects.</p> \n<p>Face scrubs with a 2% salicylic acid concentration can help balance oil production and work with other ingredients (like charcoal and Kaolin clay) to help combat acne-prone skin.</p> \n<h2>Do consumers need other products with facial scrubs?</h2> \n<p>Facial scrubs make the skin more sensitive than usual. Since they use physical abrasion, scrubbing can leave the skin with less moisture and make it more susceptible to environmental irritants like UV rays.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why consumers will need other products with their face scrubs. They\u2019ll need cleansers to remove any remaining dirt, toners to restore the skin\u2019s pH balance (and remove residual exfoliators), serums to provide nutrients and antioxidants, and moisturizers to hydrate and protect the skin.</p> \n<p>The best part is that this opens more opportunities for businesses to create value on special occasions or gifting seasons. All these products can make an irresistible exfoliation set and even be the perfect way to ease beginners into beauty regimens.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Skincare is exploding in 2024! Even men are now sticking to some kind of beauty routine to keep their skin looking fresh and great (but women still dominate the market!). Facial scrubs are integral to these beauty regimens, as many consumers prefer using them for exfoliation.</p> \n<p>The numbers don\u2019t lie! Facial scrubs started in 2024, with 201,000 people searching for them (based on Google Ads). However, selling these products needs much consideration to avoid selling the wrong product and making consumers angry.</p> \n<p>So, before jumping into the face scrub market, consider the product\u2019s mode of action, ingredient concentration, and target consumer\u2019sskin type. It\u2019ll help point toward the perfect scrubs for more sales in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

These tools have also gained popularity (a 20% search interest boost from 246,000 in October to 301,000 in November 2023) in a market filled with supplements, herbal extracts, and alternative beauty equipment.</p> \n<p>This article will explore red light therapy machines and how sellers can choose profitable ones for their niche in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsUnderstanding the concept of red light therapy5 factors to consider when choosing red light therapy machinesLast words</p> \n<h2>Understanding the concept of red light therapy</h2> \n<p>Red light therapy is an emerging non-invasive cosmetic treatment that utilizes low-wavelength red light to enhance the user\u2019s skin appearance. It helps to reduce acne, scars, wrinkles, redness, and other medical conditions.</p> \n<p>Initially, NASA explored red light therapy for promoting plant growth in space and helping to heal astronaut-related wounds. But like other advancements, research expanded into exploring additional potential applications, like skin care.</p> \n<p>The idea behind red light therapy is to impact mitochondria, often called the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d within the body\u2019s cells. Providing more energy enables other cells to function more effectively, including repairing skin, promoting new cell growth, and enhancing skin rejuvenation.</p> \n<p>In other words, red light therapy allows specific cells to absorb the light wavelengths, stimulating them to perform their functions. Remember that no evidence supports RLT\u2019s effectiveness, but it\u2019s been gaining enough attention to warrant multiple beauty devices flooding the market.</p> \n<h2>5 factors to consider when choosing red light therapy machines</h2> \n<h3>1. Red, near-infrared, or combo?</h3> \n<p>Usually, businesses can choose between three types ofred light therapy machines: red light, near-infrared light, and a combination of both. Some people often mistake them for the same thing, but these light types differ despite their similarities.</p> \n<p>For instance, infrared light is not visible to the human eye. Instead, users will feel heat on their skin, with longer wavelengths penetrating deep into the cells. Conversely, red light is visible because it has shorter wavelengths.</p> \n<p>Also, red light can\u2019t get deeply into the skin, so most consumers use it to treat the skin\u2019s surface. For this reason,red light unitsare the go-to for combating surface issues like acne, wound healing, sunburns, yeast infections, and hair loss.</p> \n<p>Since near-infrared light can penetrate three times deeper than red light, it extends these benefits to the muscles, joints, and bones. So, such units are perfect for consumers searching for something more intense than surface skin issues.</p> \n<p>However, if consumers want skin surface and deeper tissue treatments but only want one device, businesses can offer themcombo units\u2014manufacturers design them to meet a wider range of requirements.</p> \n<h3>2. Optimal wavelength</h3> \n<p>Remember that science measures light in nanometers (nm) based on wavelength. Typically, red light falls between 600 and 700 nm, which is visible and bright. On the other hand, infrared or near-infrared light falls in the 700\u2013900 nm range, which isn\u2019t visible to the naked eye.</p> \n<p>Studies indicate that light wavelengths between 660 and 670 nm and 830 and 850 nm significantly impact cellular respiration while offering the highest light absorption level.</p> \n<p>Opting forred light therapy machinesthat can deliver these optimal wavelength ranges will offer consumers maximum benefits for their skin health.</p> \n<h3>3. Light intensity & irradiance</h3> \n<p>These two factors work hand-in-hand to ensurered light machinesoffer maximum effectiveness. Light irradiance represents the unit\u2019s power density, signifying the quantity of energy reaching the user\u2019s skin. This measurement is expressed in milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2), indicating the amount of photons flowing through an area and absorbable by the cells.</p> \n<p>While irradiance is important,\u00a0 it would mean nothing without the right intensity. A low-powered unit won\u2019t be able to generate sufficient red light energy for the necessary irradiance, meaning consumers won\u2019t get the maximum benefit.</p> \n<p>But when the light is more intense, the user can absorb it in less time, providing a more efficient therapy session. Check the table below for the different irradiance levels and light intensity needed to generate it.</p> \n<h3>4. Total number of LEDs</h3> \n<p>Biggerred light therapy deviceswith more LEDs are the most effective as they shorten treatment time. More LEDs mean more red and near-infrared light than devices with fewer bulbs.</p> \n<p>In simple terms, the more LED bulbs, the better the device. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different number of LEDs and their effectiveness.</p> \n<p>Note: These are only average values. The actual number of LEDs depends on the manufacturer. Some devices can contain 1,800 bulbs, while others can go as high as 10,500 LEDs.</p> \n<h3>5. Treatment coverage area</h3> \n<p>Will the treatment be for the whole body or only the face? While many consumers may opt for smaller devices to treat stretch marks, wrinkles, and other aging signs, others may shift toward bigger ones to maximize the red light therapy for hair loss, joint pain, muscle recovery, and hormone balance.</p> \n<p>Consumers with flexible budgets will seered light therapy machineswith maximum coverage as a better investment. These larger devices, like panels andbeds, will generate more energy and perform better than smaller ones.</p> \n<p>But don\u2019t throw away the thought of smaller devices. Models like handheld wands and masks are portable and lightweight, allowing consumers to take them on trips\u2014sothese devicesare the better option for target consumers who want to access red light therapy anywhere, anytime.</p> \n<h2>Last words</h2> \n<p>With technology advancing beyond what most people expect, new ways to enhance the skin are popping up\u2014andred light therapy machinesare topping the list.</p> \n<p>Originally explored to help plant growth and promote quick healing, this light technology quickly made a name for itself in the cosmetic industry. Now, various devices, like wands, beds, and handheld variants, are available to give consumers a rejuvenating experience.</p> \n<p>However, before grabbing this market\u2019s various opportunities, businesses must consider the factors discussed in this article. It\u2019ll ensure sellers only choose the ones that resonate with their target audience for more sales.</p> \n"}]}

Additionally, the trend of incorporating natural, derived from nature, and organic ingredients into skin care products across a wide range of price points is making these products accessible to consumers from all financial backgrounds, further fuelling market expansion. The value of the worldwide skin care products market stood at $170.7 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to climb to $241.5 billion by 2025, with an expected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.6% from 2024 to 2025. This article delves into the key factors propelling the skin care products market forward, spotlighting the trends, challenges, and opportunities shaping the future of beauty and personal care.</p> \n<h2>Market Analysis</h2> \n<p>The market for skin care products offers a wide array of items including face creams, body lotions, face washes, and various other products designed for skin care. These specialized products aim to heal damaged skin while enhancing its natural beauty and glow. They play a crucial role in hydrating dry skin, eliminating excessive oil from oily skin, and supporting the overall well-being of the skin. Given their varied functions, it\u2019s essential to use a range of skin care products tailored to meet specific needs.</p> \n<p>Cosmetics have become an essential part of modern life, driven by contemporary standards for personal appearance and social conduct, leading to an increased focus on external beauty. This shift has significantly contributed to the growing demand for skin care products. The expansion of the global population, coupled with rising incomes, has further boosted the consumption of these products. Rapid economic development and higher disposable incomes worldwide are altering consumer lifestyles. People are becoming increasingly conscious of skin care and hygiene importance, prompting them to invest in skin care products. Moreover, not just women but men too are incorporating skin care products into their daily routines, propelling the global market forward. This lifestyle evolution has spurred growth in the skincare and cosmetic sectors globally. Consequently, changes in lifestyle preferences, especially in emerging economies, have played a crucial role in advancing the global skin care products market.</p> \n<h2>Demographic distribution</h2> \n<p>People of all age groups turn to a variety of skin care products, including moisturisers, lotions, skin-lightening creams, toners, serums, sunscreens, body lotions, and body oils, among others, to prevent premature aging, acne, and dark spots, and to boost their appearance. A growing number of individuals are leaning towards these products as a means to protect and care for their skin amidst the challenges posed by environmental changes. Additionally, a significant portion of consumers is taking the initiative to educate themselves about their unique skin types and their specific care requirements.</p> \n<p>This informed approach is leading to an increased demand for skincare products tailored to individual skin needs, thereby contributing to the expansion of the market. Younger consumers in particular are showing an increased interest in skin care products, aiming to establish healthy skin care routines early on. This trend is playing a significant role in driving the growth of the skincare products market.</p> \n<h2>Challenges and pricing dynamics</h2> \n<p>The increase in raw material costs significantly affects the manufacturing expenses of products, leading to higher prices for the end products. This issue poses a major challenge to the growth of the global skin care products industry. Higher product prices are likely to reduce demand in price-sensitive developing countries like India and China. While high costs will have a more pronounced impact on emerging economies compared to developed ones such as the U.S. and the UK, price-conscious consumers in these developed regions will also feel the pinch as product prices escalate. This situation imposes a constraint on the skin care products market. Moreover, innovations in packaging materials for skin care products, such as the use of recycled plastics and cardboard, further contribute to a rise in product prices as manufacturers seek to maintain their profit margins. The increased cost of both ingredients and packaging materials adversely affects the skin care products market.</p> \n<h2>The rise of ethical and inclusive beauty</h2> \n<p>Active participants in the skin care products market are introducing innovative products to attract consumer interest. They are developing advanced face creams and body lotions with higher Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and skin-soothing ingredients like aloe or coconut butter to protect against sun damage. Additionally, to cater to the growing demand for ethical skin care, numerous brands are incorporating natural and derived-from-nature ingredients into their offerings, ensuring that many products are completely vegan. Furthermore, a significant trend among skin care product manufacturers is the creation of gender-neutral cosmetics suitable for men, women, and non-binary individuals alike. This approach is anticipated to further drive the growth of the skin care products market in the future.</p> \n<h3>Trends analysis takes out</h3> \n<h2>Future trends and market predictions</h2> \n<p>Leading company executives report that skin care products are among the most commonly used cosmetics and personal care items globally. A vast majority of individuals worldwide utilize these products frequently to rejuvenate or repair skin damage caused by environmental factors such as sun exposure, pollution, and dust. The extensive variety of brands and products in the skincare market offers consumers ample choices, fostering the market growth.</p> \n<p>Affordable skincare items have emerged as the preferred choice for consumers with middle to lower incomes, attributed to their accessibility and budget-friendly prices. As these products are in high demand, major skin care product manufacturers primarily target the economic segment. However, with the global rise in living standards, there is an increasing demand for high-end products. Many brands are now creating premium versions of their budget-friendly products, aiming to deepen customer loyalty and facilitate a smooth transition to more luxurious options, all while maintaining their presence in the budget-friendly range.</p> \n<p>The future will see a surge in the popularity of organic and natural skin care products as consumer preference shifts towards eco-friendly, green, and vegan options. Companies are moving away from synthetic ingredients to safeguard skin health. The growing demand for serums, scrubs, face packs, toners, and other skin care items in developing nations is expected to drive market expansion. Additionally, continuous innovation by manufacturers to deliver superior products will further fuel the growth of the skincare products market.</p> \n"}]}

Like styrofoam variants, the canvas material can absorb moisture and odors over time.</p> \n<h3>Polyethylene mannequin head</h3> \n<p>PE mannequin headsare like the all-around champions in the wig-styling world. They perfectly balance toughness/durability and moisture resistance, making them the go-to for keeping wigs safe and looking great.</p> \n<p>Note: thesemannequin headsare more expensive, so they\u2019re only great for consumers who don\u2019t mind the extra cost.</p> \n<h2>What to look for when purchasing mannequin heads for wigs</h2> \n<h3>Color</h3> \n<p>One amazing thing aboutmannequin headsis that consumers can get them in their favorite colors. While skin tones are an option, there are many more shades ladies can choose from, just like in real life. They may want a red, blue, yellow, or green mannequin head!</p> \n<p>However, wig stores needmannequin headcolors for reasons more than personal preference. For instance, they\u2019ll want display heads that match their store\u2019s branding.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, wig stores with enough space could go all out, creating a vibrant rainbow of mannequin heads for a striking theme. Depending on the target\u2019s vision, color might be more crucial than size.</p> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>Choosing amannequin headsize is often overlooked because the standard (21-22\u201d in circumference) is suitable for most situations and accessories. Nevertheless, wig stores must consider various size ranges to accommodate diverse customer needs.</p> \n<p>While they can get adjustable mannequin heads for flexibility, it\u2019s easier to display various sizes at all times\u2014that way, stores will always be ready for the larger or smaller-than-average customer.</p> \n<p>But what if consumers are not selling wigs? Their choice of size will depend on other factors. Do they need something portable? Or something easy to store? For such consumers, the smaller the mannequin head, the better the chances of them picking it up.</p> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>Themannequin head\u2019smaterial could be more important to consumers than its size. If target users prioritize portability, opt for polystyrene or plastic instead of heavy wood.</p> \n<p>Fiberglass is another popular material for mannequin heads, as it easily adds detailed facial features to mannequin heads. Conversely, glass may be heavier, but it is the perfect material for elegant display heads.</p> \n<h3>Style</h3> \n<p>The variety of mannequin head styles is impressive. Are consumers leaning towards realistic features or a smooth, versatile canvas? There\u2019s amannequin headavailable that suits their needs and preferences.</p> \n<p>For instance, some manufacturers even offer skull-shaped mannequin heads for gothic stores and artistic displays. Even if consumers have preferences that steer away from traditional head shapes, sellers can find the perfect offer.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Consumers need the right mannequin head to maintain their wig shape, stop pesky tangling, allow proper airflow, and make styling easier. With their importance, it\u2019s no surprise that mannequin heads will be a profitable market in 2024.</p> \n<p>But before investing in these wig accessories, consider color, size, material, and style. This will help ensure businesses choose mannequin heads their target consumers will love!</p> \n"}]}

The market is also benefiting from increased economic empowerment of women and the widespread establishment of shopping malls and department stores, making it easier to introduce and popularize imported brands among the youth.</p> \n<h2># Recent Updates in the Body Lotion Industry</h2> \n<h2>Looking forward</h2> \n<p>Furthermore, the evolution of distribution channels incorporating technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and smart sensors enhances the shopping experience across both physical and online platforms. These technologies enable brands to offer personalized products and recommendations, catering to a variety of skin types and concerns, and to gather valuable data on skin health for the development of more effective skincare solutions.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The body lotion market is experiencing a period of significant transformation and growth, reflecting broader shifts in consumer behavior and technological advancements.

Some people also call them breast prostheses.</p> \n<p>These products are popular among breast cancer survivors who go through a single or double mastectomy. While most healthcare services offer reconstructive breast surgery with the breast removal procedure, only a select few can handle the aftercare costs and effects.</p> \n<p>For this reason, many of these women prefer going flat and using the moreaffordable breast formto regain confidence.

This proves a lot of women worry about their bust shape and size.</p> \n<p>But since everyone can\u2019t afford such procedures, breast forms are an incredible alternative that satisfies their needs. Such consumers could hope to fill out a particular outfit\u2014as long as it involves increasing the bust, breast forms can handle it.</p> \n<h2>An overview of the breast form market</h2> \n<p>According to reports, thebreast form market\u2019ssize will boost from US$ 161.18 million in 2022 to US$ 312.93 million by 2030. Research also suggests the market will register an 8.11% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Here are some key market statistics to note:</p> \n<h2>Everything sellers must know before buying breast forms</h2> \n<h3>Type</h3> \n<p>The breast form market offers up to four variants. Each offers something different, with the choice depending on the consumer\u2019s preference. Here\u2019s a brief overview of each breast form type.</p> \n<p>Full breast formsare the standard for consumers without or with minimal breast tissues, including those with removed breast tissues or natural flat chests.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers designfull formsto sit against the chest wall\u2019s skin, making them feel more natural. The best part is that this type offers various backing options and matches the user\u2019s skin tone.</p> \n<p>This typeis ideal for anyone who wants more padding on one (or both) side or has part of their breast tissues removed. They\u2019re similar to full breast forms material-wise. However, consumers wear them with support garments, not on the skin.</p> \n<p>Shell forms are for women with noticeable asymmetrical natural breast tissues. Thisbreast formhelps these women by sitting over the smaller breasts like a cap.</p> \n<p>It features a soft shell that covers the smaller breast, giving it the same volume as its twin. Women also wear shell forms with bras.</p> \n<p>These formsare perfect for active women\u2014or those willing to rock outfits that require less supportive bras. True to their name, these breast forms come with adhesive backings that stick to the user\u2019s skin like glue.</p> \n<p>Stick-on forms will stay on regardless of the activity. Consumers can dance around in a strapless dress or hit the gym without worrying about the prostheses falling off.</p> \n<h3>Shape</h3> \n<p>Like natural breasts, these products come in multiple shapes. Nevertheless, some shapes can work on both sides while others can\u2019t without feeling and looking off.</p> \n<p>Here are some of the most common breast form shapes:</p> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>Usually, breast forms fall under three material categories: silicone, leisure, and custom-made. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each one.</p> \n<p>Silicone breast formsare the classic options. They usually have enough weight to replicate the feel of natural breasts.</p> \n<p>Further, these weighted forms can help avoid unwanted posture changes after breast removal. Hence, if consumers need only one form, they can match the weight with the remaining breast to aid overall balance.</p> \n<p>Basically,these formsare variants void of silicone. The most common materials under this category include:</p> \n<p>Leisure forms are lighter than the classic silicone, making them cooler and more comfortable. They\u2019re also the go-to for consumers with fresh scars from surgery.</p> \n<p>Note: leisure foam can also be weighted or unweighted.</p> \n<p>Custom-made forms(which can feature any material) are the perfect options for most consumers, whether they have mastectomy scars or naturally flat chests. These breast forms hug the body\u2019s curves and grooves naturally.</p> \n<h3>Ease of use</h3> \n<p>Breast formscome in different types ranging from variants that stick to the skin, fit into bras, and garment pockets.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers make breast-form bras with the necessary pockets. And the best part is these pockets are often enough to host different form sizes, allowing consumers to make easy swaps.</p> \n<p>Conversely, mostsilicone breast formshave designs that adhere directly to the skin. However, consumers can use additional adhesives if required.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Losing breast tissues to cancer should not be the end of a woman\u2019s confidence. Many options exist to help them simulate the feel and weight of their naturalbreasts, preventing negative side effects like phantom limbs and changed postures.</p> \n<p>Ladies with asymmetrical breasts also see breast forms as an amazing alternative to reconstruction surgeries. Retailers can therefore use the factors discussed in this guide to make sure they are stocking the best options for their buyers in 2024!</p> \n"}]}

But if consumers have glamorous salon interiors, businesses can offer tables with stone components and white/gold color styles.</p> \n<h3>3. Check various sizes and structural options</h3> \n<p>Do target consumers have a lot of salon space? Or do they run something more compact?

And clients will also have easy access to charge their phones\u2014it\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone.</p> \n<p>Manicures can take a while which may make clients uncomfortable. That\u2019s whymanicure tablesneed padded headrests.</p> \n<p>This feature provides an area for clients to rest comfortably while nail technicians work on their hands. It also helps keep the client\u2019s hands in an easy-to-work-with position.</p> \n<p>Consumers need various tools to perform a worthwhile manicure procedure. They can use everything from cuticle cutters and nail cleaners to lotions/towels.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s whymanicure tableswith extra storage spaces are a no-brainer. It\u2019ll help nail techs keep their necessary tools within reach. Additional storage spaces also help reduce the number of items on the table\u2019s surface, helping to keep things organized and clutter-free.</p> \n<p>Would consumers want portability on their manicure tables? If yes, offering variants with built-in wheels would make it easier and safer to move the bulky furniture around.</p> \n<p>Sellers can offer manicure tables with add-on wheels if target users want semi-stationary builds. That way, consumers can throw on the wheels to try new salon layouts.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Manicure tables have evolved into beauty essentials for every salon.

Ingredient Innovations: The Allure of Modern Woody and Gourmand Notes5. Call to action</p> \n<p>As we embrace 2024, the fragrance world is witnessing a remarkable shift, marked by a striking statistic: a staggering 93% of global consumers now demand higher-quality, more potent scents. This surge in preference for full-bodied, enduring fragrances is not just a fleeting trend but a defining movement in the global fragrance market.</p> \n<p>In 2023 the iconic \u2018Savage Elixir\u2019 by Dior, a reinvention of the already popular Sauvage, is leading the charge, epitomizing the global shift towards fragrances that are not only intense but also richly composed. This global trend, increasingly embraced by both men and women, especially in the Gen Z demographic, signifies a deeper yearning for authenticity, luxury, and personal expression in a world that\u2019s rapidly evolving post-pandemic. In this exploration, we delve into the nuances of this olfactory revolution, uncovering why robust, enduring scents are shaping the new era of perfumery, a journey underscored by innovation, emotion, and a remarkable 6.24% annual growth forecast in the high-end fragrance market in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> \n<h2>TikTok\u2019s Fragrance Revolution: Gen Z\u2019s Quest for Bold, Status-Defining Scents</h2> \n<p>According to a recent study in 2015, by Allen, Havl\u00ed\u010dek & Roberts, a full-bodied, notable scent can significantly enhance and highlight an individual\u2019s unique personality. Under the influence of TikTok, Gen Z & younger Millennials are on the hunt for stronger scents, with fragrance emerging as a new symbol of status. Gen Z is the most potential consumer keen on distinguishing themselves from the norm, gravitating towards bold fragrances that establish a strong scent identity.</p> \n<p>TikTok\u2019s trending fragrances share characteristics like pronounced sillage, distinctive scent profiles, and evocative storytelling. Phlur\u2019s sensual musk EDP, Missing Person (18.8 million views), from the U.S., is renowned for its ability to evoke the subtle scent of a loved one\u2019s skin, often moving TikTok creators to tears. From Paris, Parfums de Marly\u2019s Delina EDP (48.7 million views) stands out as a sensual, rosy floral fragrance, especially favored by brides.</p> \n<h2>The Growing Appeal of Concentrated Fragrances in Designer Brands</h2> \n<p>More and more famous perfume brands are developing concentrated fragrances. The first one the market would mention is Coty\u2019s new EDP-strength Boss Bottled Parfum is making waves as one of its top global scents. Research shows consumers are willing to pay more for fragrances that last longer and use higher-quality ingredients. Maison Crivelli, a French luxury perfumery, offers its Hibiscus Mahaj\u00e1d extrait with a 32% concentration, boasting a 10-12 hour scent life. In the U.S., D.S. & Durga\u2019s unique EDP 40 Million-Year-Old Amber is crafted using rare, carefully aged materials.</p> \n<p>This trend towards more concentrated fragrances is likely driven by inflation, leading consumers to seek more value and luxury in their purchases. Instead of constantly seeking new products, many are turning to stronger versions of their favorite fragrances. These luxury variants are not only popular among consumers but also offer a more financially sustainable option for brands compared to constant new product development.</p> \n<h2>Enhanced Wellness through Advanced Functional Fragrances</h2> \n<p>The evolving fragrance industry is now intertwined with the wellness movement, leading to the creation of functional fragrances designed for more than just their scent. These innovative fragrances are formulated to offer a prolonged sensory experience, enhancing personal well-being and allowing individuals to savor their favorite scents for longer durations. Central to this trend is the concept of \u2018scent-scaping,\u2019 a practice where consumers thoughtfully craft their personal scent environment. This involves the strategic layering of fragrances \u2013 starting with a base of rich, concentrated extrait scents and then adding lighter Eau de Toilettes or solid perfumes to suit varying needs throughout the day. A prime example of this trend can be seen with Edeniste\u2019s Lifeboost fragrance shots in the United States, offering a customizable scent experience tailored to individual preferences and moods.</p> \n<p>This wellness-centric approach extends beyond traditional perfumes. For instance, in China, brands like Arome Manpo are at the forefront of integrating aromatherapy-infused scents into skincare products, seamlessly incorporating wellness into daily routines. These products offer a multifaceted fragrance experience, blending sensory pleasure with health benefits. This new direction in fragrance design is transforming how people use and perceive scents. It goes beyond the usual uses of fragrance, highlighting its importance in enhancing overall well-being. This approach positions scents as an essential part of our everyday life and signifies a major shift in how the fragrance industry operates.</p> \n<h2>The Allure of Modern Woody and Gourmand Notes</h2> \n<p>With the rising popularity of full-bodied perfumes, the market is rapidly expanding, especially with the growing acceptance of Woody and Gourmand Notes in Middle Eastern and Asian cultures. For instance, in the U.S., Ellis Brooklyn is making waves with their \u2018Vanilla Milk,\u2019 while Dubai\u2019s Kayali is captivating the senses with \u2018Yum Pistachio Gelato,\u2019 both of which are innovative takes on rich vanilla gourmand scents.</p> \n<p>In South Korea, the fragrance brand \u2018Born to Stand Out\u2019 is redefining the classic rose and oud combination with their \u2018Unholy Oud.\u2019 This fragrance uniquely blends bright citrus, delicate florals, and smooth tonka bean, offering a fresh perspective on a traditional scent.</p> \n<p>In addition, younger fragrance enthusiasts are particularly attracted to these modern interpretations of gourmand scents. They appreciate the creative use of food-inspired ingredients that move away from overly sweet profiles. Instead, these fragrances incorporate drier, nuttier notes such as almond and pistachio, along with hints of burnt fruit. This approach not only provides a unique twist but also adds a novel character to these fragrances, making them more appealing to a diverse audience.</p> \n<h2>Action points</h2> \n<p>As we navigate through 2024, the fragrance world is not just evolving; it\u2019s revolutionizing. E-commerce retailers, this is your moment to capitalize on a market where a staggering 93% of global consumers are clamoring for high-quality, full-bodied fragrances. The message is clear: people are seeking scents that resonate with authenticity, luxury, and personal expression. There are several ways that how you may ride this wave and meet the rising demand: First, emphasize the value of stronger, long-lasting fragrances and justify their premium cost with solid evidence. Second, offer unique and bold scents that appeal to Gen Z\u2019s love for distinctive, niche fragrances. Third, focus on wellness, ensuring fragrances are long-lasting and fit seamlessly into broader wellness routines while addressing emotional needs.</p> \n"}]}

The consumer\u2019s skill level</h3> \n<p>Factor in the target consumer\u2019s expertise level in makeup application. If sellers want to cater to beginners, they must stock kits that include all the essential products. These kits should also have basic tutorials or instructions to help them get started.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if experienced users are the targets, then opting for advanced kits is the better option. These makeup kits offer a wider range of finishes and shades, allowing consumers to try whatever technique they\u2019ve mastered.</p> \n<h3>2. Think about the consumer\u2019s needs</h3> \n<p>What products would consumers use regularly? Or what would they like to experiment with? The answers to these questions will also help businesses determine the best makeup kit.</p> \n<p>For instance, consumers who only apply products to their eyes and lips will want kits focusing on those areas. But if they prefer full facial procedures, they will want kits that include various products for a complete look.</p> \n<h3>3. The customer\u2019s skin tone and type</h3> \n<p>After deciding what target consumers would most likely focus on, the next thing to consider is their skin tone and type. First, the makeup kit should cater to the target consumer\u2019s skin type. If they have oily skin, the products in the kit should be mostly dry and oil-absorbent.</p> \n<p>If they have dry skin, the kits should have more liquid products to moisturize the skin. Lastly, if target users have sensitive skin, products with hypoallergenic properties and natural ingredients are a sure bet.</p> \n<p>Skin tone is the second important aspect here. Using the wrong color will only make consumers look funny. So, ensure that the foundation and other complexion products in the kit match the target consumer\u2019s skin tone\u2014let them enjoy a seamless and natural look.</p> \n<h3>4. The quality and ingredients of the products</h3> \n<p>A makeup kit is only worth it if the products inside are good enough. For this reason, sellers must pay close attention to the quality of the items inside their prospective makeup kits.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a surefire tip: always go for makeup kits offering products made from high-quality ingredients. That way, sellers can guarantee their effectiveness, longevity, and compatibility with the target\u2019s skin.</p> \n<h3>5. Additional tools and accessories</h3> \n<p>Makeup kits must always come with essential tools and accessories\u2014how else would consumers apply their favorite products?</p> \n<p>Prioritize kits with brushes, sponges, or applicators. It makes them more convenient, especially for beginners or users who don\u2019t have all the tools necessary for makeup application.</p> \n<h3>6. The kit\u2019s packaging and portability</h3> \n<p>The packaging of a makeup kit determines its travel-friendliness. So, if target consumers plan on making frequent trips, opt for kits featuring compact and sturdy designs.

Nevertheless, many people, including celebrities, are embracing the ugly beauty trend via interesting and unconventional looks.</p> \n<p>As of fall 2023, the hashtag#UglyBeautyhas over 14 million views on TikTok. Here, we\u2019ll take a look at the ugly beauty movement, why it\u2019s popular, and what tells us about future makeup trends.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat is the \u2018ugly beauty\u2019 movement?What trends define the ugly beauty movement?Why ugly beauty is on the riseWhat ugly beauty tells us about the future of makeup</p> \n<h2>What is the \u2018ugly beauty\u2019 movement?</h2> \n<p>The concept of \u201cugly beauty\u201d refers to a form of aesthetic appreciation that challenges traditional notions of beauty. It suggests a certain allure or attractiveness in things usually considered unconventional, strange, or even traditionally unattractive.</p> \n<p>This idea often manifests in art, fashion, and design, where creators intentionally deviate from conventional beauty standards to create something that evokes a different aesthetic pleasure. Ugly beauty can be about embracing imperfections, asymmetry, or unconventional elements that challenge the viewer\u2019s expectations. For example, in fashion, designers may challenge traditional standards by incorporating unconventional materials, shapes, or patterns that challenge the viewer\u2019s expectations.</p> \n<p>The concept of ugly beauty is subjective, and what one person finds appealing, another may not. It often invites individuals to reconsider their preconceived notions of beauty and appreciate the unconventional and unexpected.</p> \n<h2>What trends define the ugly beauty movement?</h2> \n<p>Below, we delve into some makeup-based looks associated with the ugly beauty trend:</p> \n<h3>Mismatched or asymmetrical makeup</h3> \n<p>Mismatched or asymmetrical makeup can include uneven eyeliner, intentionally asymmetrical eyebrows, or different-colored eye makeup that brings attention to the look because it \u201clooks off.\u201d Sometimes, this can be subtle, which makes a person unsure about what is strange about the look, or more aggressive, like the photo above.</p> \n<h3>Bleached or shaved eyebrows</h3> \n<p>Many people have embraced the no-eyebrow look by bleaching or shaving off their eyebrows, which creates a startling and potentially unsettling look to many.#NoEyebrowMakeuphas over 152 million views on TikTok, while#BleachedBrowshas over 126 million views.</p> \n<h3>Simulated crying</h3> \n<p>On TikTok, people are also embracing the#CryingMakeuptrend, which uses makeup to capture what it looks like after the person has been crying. This look goes against traditional beauty norms and fully embraces the messy makeup aesthetic.</p> \n<h3>Overdrawn lips or exaggerated features</h3> \n<p>Embracing exaggerated features, such as overdrawn lips or intentionally overdone contouring, also challenges traditional notions of subtle and natural makeup.</p> \n<h3>Unconventional color choices</h3> \n<p>Unconventional color choices can also be a feature of ugly makeup, which may involve using clashing color combinations or applying makeup in unexpected areas.</p> \n<h3>Messy or grungy aesthetics</h3> \n<p>Ugly beauty also incorporates a messy or grungy aesthetic, which might involve smudged eyeliner, intentionally disheveled hair, or an overall \u201cundone\u201d appearance. \u201cMessy\u201d can also be achieved in a more intentional and artistic way, like in the photo above.</p> \n<h3>Highlighting imperfections</h3> \n<p>Rather than concealing perceived flaws, ugly beauty practitioners have taken to highlighting or embracing so-called imperfections. This might include everything from showcasing acne and scars to other unique features.</p> \n<h3>Clashing textures</h3> \n<p>Experimenting with textures that might be considered unconventional adds to the overall ugly beauty trend aesthetic. This can include over-applying jewels, stickers, or other objects to the face.</p> \n<h2>Why ugly beauty is on the rise</h2> \n<p>Ugly beauty is not just another social media trend but a reflection of current cultural trends. A big part of the recent popularity of ugly beauty comes from an over-saturation of beauty online and how overwhelmingly focused it is on perfection.</p> \n<p>Ugly beauty is therefore seen as a way to reclaim individualism and self-expression. And, for many, ugly beauty is a way to intentionally make people uncomfortable as a means to challenge traditional beauty norms.</p> \n<p>The result is a refreshing and new take on what beauty can be, paving the way to make people who may not feel particularly supported by conventional beauty standards and who instead embrace beauty in a way that makes them feel comfortable.</p> \n<h2>What ugly beauty tells us about the future of makeup</h2> \n<p>Beauty standards are changing, and more and more people are embracing their individuality and challenging norms.</p> \n<p>While the products consumers use aren\u2019t necessarily different from what they\u2019ve always sought out, the way that they use them may differ. This trend is therefore helping to drive innovation in product development and pushing brands to design makeup that enhances unconventional or unique features, such as makeup that emphasizes freckles or skincare products that celebrate natural textures and variations in skin.</p> \n<p>It then pays for businesses to offer a wider variety of makeup products, celebrate unique features, and avoid a one-size-fits-all approach tobeauty.</p> \n<p>But the most crucial takeaway is that to be successful a brand\u2019s marketing must also adapt. Businesses must think about diversity and embrace individuality when it comes to marketing strategies, taking special care to engage with their target consumers through social media. This could involve featuring models and influencers who do not fit traditional beauty standards, showcasing the beauty of imperfections, and promoting authenticity over idealized images.</p> \n<p>Ugly beauty is also likely to impact the design and packaging of beauty products. Brands might opt for unconventional and bold designs that challenge traditional notions of beauty, helping to create a unique identity for the brand that resonates with consumers looking for something different.</p> \n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for makeup, packaging, or an overview of the products currently taking over the market, you\u2019ll find everything you need onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

Experts predict the market will register a steady 3.56% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2028. The United States generated the highest revenue when comparing global figures, contributing a whopping US$ 5.029 billion.</p> \n<p>Here are the key market drivers responsible for the global eye beauty market\u2019s growth:</p> \n<h2>Five amazing eyelid tools consumers will love in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Eyelid primer</h3> \n<p>Theseliquid or cream-based productsare the go-to for making shadows and eyeliners on eyelids look smoother and last longer. They\u2019re like double-sided tapes that secure the eye makeup to the user\u2019s lid, ensuring the artistic creation doesn\u2019t budge.</p> \n<p>Moreover, they can also help enhance the consumer\u2019s makeup hues and make them look more vibrant.Primerscreate a base on the eyelids, which absorbs excess oils and provides an even surface for customers to run wild creatively.</p> \n<p>Withoutprimers, consumers with greasy eyelids won\u2019t have a fun time with their eye makeup. For instance, any eyeshadow they apply without primers will quickly get the pesky \u201ccreased\u201d effect. The look may also become patchy and uneven.</p> \n<p>Eyelid primers have been getting some attention lately. Based on Google Ads reports, these products have registered a 20% boost in the past month, from 18100 in October to 22200 in November 2023.</p> \n<h3>Eyeshadow brushes</h3> \n<p>Eyeshadow brushesperform one function excellently\u2014helping consumers sweep eye shadow across their lids and upper eye areas. These tools come in various types, and they handle primer applications conveniently.</p> \n<p>The classic shaders are must-haves as their design offers perfect coverage over the entire lid. The best part is theseeyeshadow brushescan hold a good amount of shadow. Combined with their wide semi-circle edge, these brushes make applying the perfect eyeshadow amount as easy as a few swipes.</p> \n<p>Small shaders are variants that excel more at blending eye makeup. They have short, tightly-packed bristles, ideal for smudging and applying shadows or creams along the lash lines. Similarly,precise shadersare also available, with round brush heads for incredible precision.</p> \n<p>While othereyeshadow brush typesexist, these three are the most common ones in most eye makeup kits. Eyeshadow brushes hold a significant search interest on Google Ads, which has recently increased. In October, they had 27100 searches. But come November, interest in them boosted to 33100 inquiries\u2014a 20% uptick in one month.</p> \n<h3>Eyeliner applicators</h3> \n<p>When creating a sharp winged eye or anyeyeliner style, the kind of applicators consumers use is important. While getting free brushes in makeup kits is nice, most consumers will prefer purchasing high-quality ones for their stronger and neater bristles.</p> \n<p>Like eyeshadow brushes,eyeliner applicatorsalso have various types. First on the list are classic eyeliner brushes. They have thin, narrow designs with fine tips, great for drawing precise lines. However, their tapered, pointed tip is ineffective for filing in or creating thick lines.</p> \n<p>Next aresemi-flat brushes. They feature rounded shapes and often come with gel eyeliners because these brushes effectively pick up eyeliner products. Semi-flat brushes are somewhat dense, making it easy to create moderately thick lines and fill in wings/angels when necessary.</p> \n<p>Lastly, angled benteyeliner brushesare handy for drawing super thin lines without smudging, giving a natural, almost \u201cno-eyeliner\u201d look. Their angled designs are also perfect for creating winged eyeliners, thanks to the bent side that allows users to draw curved lines and wings easily.</p> \n<p>While each type offers something different, they\u2019re more effective in pairs. In addition, search interest for these products has been consistent since April 2023, at 14800 inquiries per month.</p> \n<h3>Eyelash curlers</h3> \n<p>Lashes may have a beauty world of their own, but they\u2019re still technically part of the lid. So, taking care of the eyelid would also involve touching up lashes. Interestingly,eyelash curlersare among the most popular tools for beautifying natural lashes.</p> \n<p>True to their name, these tools are the perfect solution for straight, natural lashes.Their clamp designcan easily hold the user\u2019s lashes and make them curl upwards, providing the much-needed lift. The best part? The results are instant!</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier,eyelash curlersare incredibly popular in 2023. Google Ads data shows that these tools average 135000 searches monthly.</p> \n<h3>Eye massagers</h3> \n<p>Makeup is not the only way to dazzle eyelids\u2014sometimes, they also need some TLC (tender loving care). While consumers can keep their eyes comfortable and relaxed in many ways,eye massagersoffer one of the best methods.</p> \n<p>These handheld devices cover and wrap around the users\u2019 eyes, helping to massage and relax the delicate areas around them. Someadvanced variantsmay come with various massage techniques and options, allowing consumers to choose their preferred massage and pressure levels\u2014they may even offer calming music or sounds.</p> \n<p>Eye massagersusually come in two types: some work like masks covering the wearer\u2019s eyes, while others require manual hand movements. Regardless of type, these devices will stimulate the consumer\u2019s eyes using vibrating motors, airbag compression, or heating/cooling mechanisms\u2014an incredible way to enhance the eyelid\u2019s natural look.</p> \n<p>Eye massagers are enjoying steady popularity levels in 2023. They rounded up November with 49500 searches, boosting up from 40500 in June 2023.</p> \n<h2>Invest in these trends</h2> \n<p>Makeup has seen a massive popularity surge lately, thanks to consumers shifting toward DIY beauty procedures and becoming more interested in cosmetics.</p> \n<p>But consumers don\u2019t need to break the bank to start expressing their creative and artistic looks, especially on the eyelids. However, they will need a few must-haves to ensure their eyelids look phenomenal for everyday and special events.</p> \n<p>Businesses can profit from this need by stocking on eyelid primers, eyeshadow brushes, eyeliner applicators,eyelashcurlers, and eye massagers to make sure they meet the demand for this growing market in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Here, we\u2019ll detail everything you need to know about what consumers are looking for in nose strips in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are nose strips, and are they effective?Are nose strips safe for the skin?Six factors to consider when choosing nose strips in 2024Final words</p> \n<h2>What are nose strips, and are they effective?</h2> \n<p>Nose stripsare a bit like a magnet for the skin, extracting accumulated oil, dirt, blackheads, and whiteheads from the user\u2019s pores. Thanks to an adhesive that sticks them to the nose, they take all the icky stuff away with them when they are removed.</p> \n<p>Nose stripsare therefore a straightforward way to temporarily exfoliate the skin, providing fast and evident revitalization without breaking the bank.</p> \n<h2>Are nose strips safe for the skin?</h2> \n<p>After years of research, it\u2019s clear thatnose stripsare a completely safe means of cleaning the skin. Sticking to the top layer of the skin via skin-kind adhesives,nose stripspull away any dead skin or unwanted substances once hardened. Unlike other skincare treatments, this purification method is non-invasive and does not involve harsh chemicals.</p> \n<h2>Six factors to consider when choosing nose strips in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Skin type</h3> \n<p>Nose strips, while they can benefit every skin type by cleansing pores, may work better on certain skin types than others. Therefore, nose strips are made using different formulas, meaning that consumers can always find the perfect variety for them.</p> \n<p>For example, consumers with dry skin will appreciatenose stripsthat contain hyaluronic acid because they can help to simultaneously moisturize the skin. Conversely, super absorbent nose strips work best to help suck out sebum for consumers with oily skin. For consumers with sensitive skin, fragrance-free, non-abrasive nose strips will reduce the chances of skin irritation.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>Now more than ever, consumers are interested in the product\u2019s ingredients. No one wants to purchase a product that could adversely affect their health or harm the environment. For this reason, businesses must ensure that thenose stripsthe stock contain 0% toxic materials.</p> \n<p>Always read the manufacturer\u2019snose stripingredients list, noting that aloe vera, bamboo charcoal, hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and witch hazel are generally considered safe, gentle on the skin, and boast hydrating effects.</p> \n<p>Businesses should also invest in hypoallergenicnose stripsto avoid consumers encountering allergic reactions and irritations. Nose strips containing artificial colors, parabens, and sulfates should also be avoided as they may be detrimental to the user\u2019s skin.</p> \n<h3>Application process</h3> \n<p>Nose strips are a DIY piece of beauty kit that help exfoliate and clean the surface layer of the nose\u2019s pores. The keyword here is \u201cdo it yourself!\u201d So, when choosingnose strips, businesses should consider how easy they will be for consumers to use. Anything with too many steps may be a major turn-off for consumers who want a quick fix.</p> \n<p>The best rule of thumb is to picknose stripswith a simple design and application process. How do you know that that is the case? The answer lies in the packaging, which is where you\u2019ll most likely find details of the application process. In addition, look for nose strips whose drying time does not exceed 20 minutes.</p> \n<h3>Size and shape</h3> \n<p>Nose stripscome in different shapes and sizes so as to suit the various nose contours. This ensures that they are easy to apply and remove comfortably.</p> \n<p>Even in the case where the wearers\u2019 facial features vary significantly,nose stripswork best when covering the entire nose. However, they shouldn\u2019t extend beyond the nose area, as removing them might cause discomfort and leave other areas of the skin red.</p> \n<h3>Adhesion and removal</h3> \n<p>The whole point ofnose stripsis for them to stick to the nose and remove blemishes. This process is seriously devalued if the strip\u2019s adhesive doesn\u2019t work properly; nose strips that don\u2019t stick won\u2019t remove anything, while those that are too sticky may prove difficult to remove, potentially damaging the skin.</p> \n<p>Hydrocolloid is the best adhesive fornose stripsto use. Hydrocolloid is a gel-like substance that sticks to the skin and gently extracts sebum, promoting the quick healing of acne on the nose. Other healthy adhesive options include polyvinyl acetate and acrylate-based adhesives.</p> \n<p>We\u2019d recommend avoidingnose stripswith adhesives that contain sulfates and phthalates as they often contain fragrances and preservatives that may be toxic to the skin.</p> \n<h3>Additional benefits</h3> \n<p>Nose stripsprimarily cleanse the nose of dirt, oil, blackheads, and whiteheads. But they wouldn\u2019t be so popular if that\u2019s all they did.</p> \n<p>Below are just some of the other benefits that businesses can use to promotenose strips:</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Nose strips are making waves in the beauty market as instant tools for achieving bright and healthy skin. However, their efficiency is only as good as their quality.</p> \n<p>To provide consumers with the best nose strips, you should consider the consumer\u2019s skin type, ingredients, application process, shape, size, adhesion, removal, and additional benefits. Prioritize these factors to find greater success in selling in 2024.</p> \n<p>For a massive range of nose strips and other beauty products, head toAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

Although they may have more friction, material blend cotton pads are the go-to products for removing makeup.</p> \n<p>Lastly, non-woven fabric pads come in with a different purpose.

It\u2019s one of the reasons why theglobal market for makeup spongesis experiencing success, with experts predicting it will grow from US $638.58 million in 2022 to US $1.2 billion by 2032, with a 7% CAGR over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>The increasing demand for natural and eco-friendly beauty products has also led to the introduction of organic makeup sponges, further driving market growth. North America is currently leading as the biggest regional market, with experts predicting it will hold its dominance over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>3 things to consider when choosing the perfect makeup sponge</h2> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>The material used to make a makeup sponge matters for two major reasons: performance and safety. Makeup sponges are mainly used to set, blend, and apply cosmetics. However, accomplishing that can be difficult if the makeup sponge is made of hard or non-pliable material.</p> \n<p>Consumers are also increasingly concerned about the materials they use \u2013 especially on their skin. It may therefore pay you to invest in makeup sponges made from more biodegradable materials, making them easy on the skin and friendly to the environment.</p> \n<h3>Foundation type</h3> \n<p>Are makeup sponges excellent at applying foundation? Yes. Do all makeup sponges work with different foundation types? Certainly not! Some makeup sponges work better with specific foundations.</p> \n<p>For instance, makeup sponges with flat edges are great for cream foundations because the pointed ends help with precise application. On the other hand, round makeup sponges are ideal for stick foundations because they are versatile enough for blending. Finally, a slightly less absorbent makeup sponge does wonders with powder foundation because the application is more controlled.</p> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>We all have different face shapes and features, so it\u2019s important that businesses stock up on different sizes of makeup sponge to suit each consumer\u2019s specific needs. For example, smaller faces and more exact applications may require smaller sponges, etc.</p> \n<h2>Different types of makeup sponges to leverage</h2> \n<h3>Disposable makeup sponges</h3> \n<p>While not the most eco-friendly option,disposable makeup spongesare super convenient, saving consumers the hassle of washing their makeup sponge after use.</p> \n<p>Typically, manufacturers makedisposable makeup spongesfrom foam, making them suitable for heavy foundation applications. Although these sponges are relatively cheap, they don\u2019t have the best absorbency, limiting them in terms of the range of what they can achieve \u2013 especially for liquid products.</p> \n<h3>Air cushion puffs</h3> \n<p>When it comes to versatility,air cushion puffsstand at the top of the ladder. Consumers can use them for everything, from applying concealers to working with powders and foundations. Air cushion puffs are also lightweight and can easily slip into a bag for on-the-go use.</p> \n<p>The best part is thatair cushion puffsare ultra-soft, providing seamless foundation coverage. Air cushion puffs are usually friendly to sensitive skin, so there\u2019s no need to worry about possible irritation.</p> \n<h3>Powder puffs</h3> \n<p>Powder puffsare small, malleable sponges most suitable for powder complexion products. They are gentle on the skin and provide an even foundation distribution. Seeing as they\u2019re reusable, powder puffs are also a cost-effective option for consumers who do not wish to repeatedly buy and replace makeup sponges.</p> \n<p>Standardpowder puffsare made of satin, velour, and synthetic fibers. These materials absorb excess oil on the skin, reduce mess caused by stray powder, and help to create the perfect matte finish.</p> \n<h3>Silicon sponges</h3> \n<p>Silicon spongesare a unique type of makeup sponge made entirely of silicon. Compared to other makeup sponges, silicone sponges are non-porous, meaning they don\u2019t absorb cosmetics. And whilethese productsmay not be \u201csponges\u201d per se, they are used in the same way.</p> \n<p>Better yet?Silicon spongesare durable, less prone to tearing, and super easy to clean. However, keep in mind that not all consumers prefer their harder texture, feel, and the streaky look that they can sometimes cause.</p> \n<h3>Cleaning sponges</h3> \n<p>Finally,cleaning spongesare not designed for the application of cosmetics, but rather, for removing makeup following a facial cleanse.</p> \n<p>Thesespongesare incredibly soft and made from stretchy, bouncy cellulose, making them great at removing makeup and cleansing the user\u2019s face effectively.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Makeup sponges are a crucial addition to any beauty kit. When stocking up on disposable makeup sponges, air cushion puffs, powder puffs, silicone sponges, and cleaning sponges, remember to keep in mind material, size, and what your consumers are most likely looking for.</p> \n<p>With thousands of makeup products and accessories from trusted sellers,Alibaba.comis your one-stop-shop for wholesale beauty items.</p> \n"}]}

Experts predict theglobal tanning bedmarket will experience a 6.0% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to reach US $7.4 billion by 2027.</p> \n<p>The benefits of tanning beds, including enhanced mood, improved appearance, and increased vitamin D levels, are helping to drive market growth. The rising demand for personal/luxury care treatments and advancements in tanning tech are also boosting market growth.</p> \n<p>Europe generated the largest market share, and experts say the region will remain dominant over the forecast period. However, North America follows closely behind due to the widespread indoor tanning in the region.</p> \n<h2>Types of tanning beds</h2> \n<p>After their debut in the 1920s, tanning beds have gone through a necessary journey to provide the services consumers enjoy today. From the first tanning salon opening in Berlin, Germany, in 1977 to tanning beds becoming popular in the late 70s and 80s, they are now all over Europe and America.</p> \n<p>Although tanning beds were originally salon exclusives, variants now exist for home use. For this reason, businesses can sell two types of tanning bed: commercial and residential.</p> \n<h3>Commercial tanning beds</h3> \n<p>Commercial tanning bedsare what people mostly see in tanning salons. Large designs accommodate various consumer heights, shapes, and sizes.</p> \n<p>These units may even offer appealing advanced tech features, like air conditioning and aromatherapy. More importantly,commercial tanning bedsare powerful, making them the best option to glow up in a few minutes.</p> \n<h3>Residential tanning beds</h3> \n<p>Althoughcommercial tanning bedswere a big hit, they had a major issue. Not everyone could afford frequent salon visits to keep their beautiful tans.</p> \n<p>And commercial variants are big units that simply won\u2019t fit in a regular home setting.

While they may not be as powerful as their commercial counterparts,residential tanning bedsmore than make up for them with convenience and comfort.</p> \n<h2>6 factors worth considering when searching for tanning beds</h2> \n<h3>1. Durability and space required</h3> \n<p>One of the most important things to watch out for is material and durability\u2014these factors depend on the unit\u2019s purpose. While consumers may usehome tanning bedsa few times a week, commercial variants can work several shifts daily at different wattages, making them more durable.</p> \n<p>For this reason,commercial modelsare heavy-duty, with manufacturers making them from thicker acrylic parts to ensure durability. However, this aspect also makes them larger than what\u2019s required for homeowners.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, residential tanning beds come with slimmer designs that take up less room. But here\u2019s the catch: they sacrifice some durability to achieve their smaller sizes, meaning they need more delicate care to work effectively for longer.</p> \n<h3>2. Power consumption</h3> \n<p>Tanning beds are machines that draw significant power, but both types do it differently. For instance, manufacturers designcommercial tanning bedsto power up fast since salons will turn them on and off several times daily.</p> \n<p>The downside is that they\u2019ll need a lot of power to complete this feat, so they\u2019re restricted to salons. Commercial tanning beds average 1,500 to 2,500 watts of power, meaning they can use up to 2.5 kilowatts per hour.</p> \n<p>In contrast, residential tanning beds may take longer to power up, but they\u2019re not power-hungry units. Using commercial tanning beds at home can send the consumer\u2019s electricity bill through the roof, so offering them a residential version is the better choice.</p> \n<p>Ideally, residential tanning beds should consume between 1,000 and 1,500 watts. The most energy-efficient range provides enough power for a safe and effective tanning session. Anything higher than that won\u2019t be fit for home use.</p> \n<h3>3. Tanning bed shape</h3> \n<p>Usually, tanning beds come in two popular shapes: horizontal lie-down andvertical stand-up options. Horizontal tanning beds are the most common types available, and they offer an incredibly comfortable, convenient tanning experience\u2014consumers can relax while the machine does its thing.</p> \n<p>Whilehorizontal bedsare perfect for long tanning sessions, vertical variants are the go-to for quick and easy tans. While they take up less space, they can get very uncomfortable if consumers use them for long periods of time.</p> \n<h3>4. Number of lamps</h3> \n<p>The number of lamps in atanning unitdetermines its UV-ray strength. In this case, higher isn\u2019t the best. Consumers don\u2019t need tanning beds with higher lamp counts to rock their desired bronze level\u2014and more lamps mean higher power consumption.</p> \n<p>On this note,commercial tanning bedsoffer between 24 and 48 lamps, while the most anyone can see in residential models is 36. Thankfully, most residential tanning beds offer 24 lamps, with some going as low as 16.</p> \n<h3>5. High or low-pressure bulbs</h3> \n<p>Tanning bedsoften offer different pressure levels, determining their UVA ray intensity. For instance, levels 1 and 2 units offer low-pressure bulbs with higher UVA emissions.</p> \n<p>Conversely, levels 3 to 6 models use high-pressure bulbs that generate lower UVA rays. Low-pressurebulbsare ideal for infrequent users, while high-pressure variants are the best for maintaining tans over extended periods.</p> \n<h3>6. Consumer skin type</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s common knowledge that consumers have different skin types, so naturally, some users will see better results undertanning bedsthan others. Moreover, it depends on the UV lamp\u2019s strength.</p> \n<p>Consumers with more sensitive skin or those susceptible to burns will see home tanning beds as a better offer\u2014especially models with fewer lamps and lower UV lights.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Tanning beds are fantastic machines that transform something once restricted to the outdoors into a thrilling indoor experience. However, the type of products businesses should purchase depends on the target consumers.</p> \n<p>If retailers prefer selling to salons, they must stock up on commercial tanning beds. They have all the requirements to provide the best experience for multiple people. But if the focus is on homes, residential models are the way to go.</p> \n<p>Consider these tips to give consumers the bronze they desire in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

And while non-surgical hair loss therapy and hair transplants are great ways to improve it, what happens when consumers don\u2019t see them as options?</p> \n<p>Thankfully, they can turn to toupees to help recover their lost esteem, especially when men can\u2019t have a hair transplant. But a lot is considered when choosing toupees, meaning businesses must think properly before purchasing bulk.</p> \n<p>This article will provide everything businesses need to offer excellent toupees for men suffering from hair loss.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsA brief look at the global toupee market5 factors to consider before choosing the ideal toupeeSumming up</p> \n<h2>A brief look at the global toupee market</h2> \n<p>Toupees are part of theglobal hair wig and extension market, which experts currently value at US $6.83 billion. Forecasts suggest the market will reach US $12.27 billion by 2030, growing at an 8.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p> \n<p>The sudden surge of social media platforms created a wave of hairpiece-related content, exposing people to the endless possibilities of hair wigs and extensions. Experts designate this trend as the primary growth driver for the global market.</p> \n<p>In addition, the increasing presence of hair-related conditions and the effects of chemotherapy are also driving the growth of the hair wig industry. North America reigned supreme as the regional leader in 2022, capturing over 40% of the overall market revenue.</p> \n<h2>5 factors to consider before choosing the ideal toupee</h2> \n<h3>1. Understand the target consumer\u2019s needs</h3> \n<p>Understanding the target consumers\u2019 requirements is crucial before diving into the world of toupees. In this regard, sellers must consider the following factors:</p> \n<p>First, check if the target consumer\u2019s hair loss is permanent (like pattern baldness) or temporary (like the effects of chemotherapy). Consumers with temporary hair loss may not need toupees, but those with permanent issues will need them as they\u2019re designed for long-term use.</p> \n<p>After deciding if it is permanent or temporary, factor in the consumer\u2019s preferred look and hairstyle. Do they want hairpieces that look and feel like natural hair? Or will they prefer experimenting with different styles and colors?</p> \n<p>Finally, consider the daily activities target consumers do or evaluate their lifestyle. If they are more active, offer options that stick to their heads during physical activities.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose the right material</h3> \n<p>Materials also determine the toupees\u2019 comfort and appearance. Sellers can choose from these options:</p> \n<p>If consumers want the most natural appearance possible, they\u2019ll lovehuman hair toupees. Men can even style, color, and treat these hairpieces like natural ones.</p> \n<p>But here\u2019s the catch: their similarities also extend to maintenance. Men will have to wash them to maintain their good appearance. They break down fast, meaning consumers will replace them after a few years. Plus,human hair toupeesare a bit on the pricey side.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, these hairpieces are the most comfortable to wear for extended periods. Consumers can also choose based on the hair\u2019s ethnicity and sewing direction, though it may affect the cost.</p> \n<p>If human hair is too expensive for consumers, they can opt for synthetic hair toupees. They\u2019re affordable, low-maintenance, and come in various styles/colors.</p> \n<p>Thesesynthetic hairpiecesretain their shape regardless of the weather conditions. Also, they don\u2019t need washing or styling and can handle more abuse.</p> \n<p>However, they may not offer the same feel and look as their human-hair counterparts.

Scent trends forecasting helps retailers curate products aligned with consumer olfactory preferences. Analysis indicates shoppers will gravitate toward multifunctional fragrances supporting winter wellness and mood, affordable indulgences through everyday premium scents, and unexpected aromas inspired by folklore and nostalgia. Retailers can capture interest by exploring healing sage notes, grown-up gourmands evoking festive cocktails, and woody profiles with a Nordic forest twist. Product applications span across bath and body, candles, and personal care. monitoring emerging trends while investing in those with established appeal.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Bring back festive oranges in beauty and body care2. Heal and uplift with medicinal fragrances3. Indulge in grown-up boozy gourmand scents4. Infuse everyday products with opulent noble notes5. Explore folkloric fragrances with Nordic woodland scents6. Final thoughts</p> \n<h2>Bring back festive oranges in beauty and body care</h2> \n<p>Fragrance profiles featuring bright citrus notes nod to long standing traditions and bring a cheerful scent option compared to heavier winter accords. Beauty brands can explore tangerine, clementine, kumquat and other mandarins to develop products leveraging customs around Lunar New Year and Christmas celebrations. These festivals represent opportune moments for retailers to connect scents with gift-giving across categories like bath and body, skin care, and hair care.</p> \n<p>Shopper interest persists for classic yet modern citrus scents symbolizing luck and prosperity. By blending floral and spiced accents like ginger or tea with main citrus notes, retailers can deliver the nostalgic factor while preventing flat single-scent products. Brands might convey vivid sensory details through naming and descriptions highlighting visions of ornamental fruit bowls or customary house visits bearing mandarin gifts. Consumers seek not only fragrance but also function out of winter wellness items, so positioning citrus as an ingredient providing antioxidants and a bright sensory experience proves strategically wise. Promoting citrus scents in formats like body mists, candles, and diffusers enables affordability amid bigger seasonal purchases.</p> \n<p>Overall, reinventing mandarin notes from a from-the-past mentality to forward-facing interpretations can help retailers captivate shoppers through multicultural holidays while making citrus scents feel new.</p> \n<h2>Heal and uplift with medicinal fragrances</h2> \n<p>Come the new year, consumers typically set wellness intentions like supporting winter health or managing low moods amid post-holiday fatigue. Retailers can provide uplifting product solutions through traditionally healing and purifying scents. Profile notes might encompass clary sage, holy basil, cannabis, benzoin resin, vetiver, and crystal extracts for their ties to ancient medicinal practices or modern alt-sciences.</p> \n<p>Though slightly more earthy or herbal on initial sniff, these wellness-linked fragrances connect with consumers prioritizing inner calm and restorative self-care. Brand messaging could reference cleansing negative energy or kickstarting on a blank slate. Retailers might explore medicinal smoking bundles akin to Native American sage rituals and translate the concept into products like room sprays and reed diffusers. For beauty, body, and bath retailers, scent applications present in massage oils, bath soaks, or moisturizers to unwind the body.</p> \n<p>With some nostalgic and spiritual slants, this trend allows for imaginative yet functional storytelling. Retailers can focus on creating ambiences where people relax through lighting, space design, and soundscapes. By imbuing products with intention versus just aroma, brands enable shoppers to ritualize using medicinal scents as conduits of winter healing on physical, mental, and emotional levels.</p> \n<h2>Indulge in grown-up boozy gourmand scents</h2> \n<p>Among winter\u2019s sweet seasonal fragrances, retailers can look to adult-inspired gourmand scents alluding to cocktail culture. Profile inspirations stem from festive nibbles and drinks like bourbon, rum, gin, whiskey sours, mulled wines, and spiked cranberry punch. By focusing on the indulgent nights in or out during the holidays, fragrance notes can capture nostalgia and sophistication compared to typically juvenile candy cane or cookie scents.</p> \n<p>Retailers might explore fragrance translations of signature cocktails served at in-store or online launch events. Brands could creatively title products after drinks like Pom Cosmos or Gingerbread Martinis. Gourmand fragrance accords also adapt well to self-care rituals through products like scented lip scrubs, bath melts, body butters, and shimmer mists. For home and gifting, candles and reed diffusers enable customers to infuse party atmospheres.</p> \n<p>As the \u201cit\u201d gourmand, retailers should note rising interest in pistachio fragrances, with increased consumer searches and TikTok hype. Pairing the nutty pistachio and tonka bean with light florals or vanillas creates a more gender-neutral scent solution. Ultimately, grown-up gourmands allow retailers to pivot typical holiday-themed products to Adultland.</p> \n<h2>Infuse everyday products with opulent noble notes</h2> \n<p>Retailers have an opportunity to democratize ultra-luxury fragrances by infusing the precious oils and resins used in ceremonial traditions into everyday products. Accords like oud, rosewater, saffron, frankincense, and myrrh exude affluence yet tend to concentrate in fine fragrance. By exploring smoky, floral, spiced interpretations of these noble notes across body care, hair care, and home care, retailers cater to consumers manifesting royalty in daily life.</p> \n<p>Brand storytelling could reference ancient practices in places like Ancient Egypt where figures like Cleopatra indulged in beauty rituals still considered posh today. Descriptive copy might highlight golden flecks signifying precious souks or silk garments with fine embroidery befitting nobility. From body creams infected with musk and patchouli to laundry products eliciting spiced chai, base notes typically reserved for high perfume take on new dimension in products focused on small indulgences versus big-ticket items.</p> \n<p>Affordability proves essential here, as does multi-use functionality. Mass formats like deodorant sticks, shower gels, reed diffusers expand who can access and enjoy regal scents. By focusing on senses of sight, touch, and sound too through gold accents, velvety textures, and mystical playlists brands enable full immersion into fragrant fantasies of peasantry life leveling-up.</p> \n<h2>Explore folkloric fragrances with Nordic woodland scents</h2> \n<p>Nature-inspired fragrances endure when it comes to consumer demand, especially profiles connected to fantasy and folklore. As such, retailers should note interest in transportive woodland scents alluding to Nordic forests and mythical winter creatures. Consumers, especially those already drawn toward Protopian ideals of protecting the environment, will connect with icy notes like pine, cypress, birchwood balanced by uplifting herbs and florals like fir, thyme or snowdrop.</p> \n<p>Evocative naming and storytelling helps immerse customers into the scene through sensory details and imaginative accords. Branding might reference hikes among snow-covered pines or dried twigs cracking underfoot in an elf-inhabited forest. Retailers could have fun devising proprietary ingredients like \u201csnow berry\u201d or \u201cfrost flower\u201d to pique curiosity. Including vivid visual cues on packaging and marketing also enables stronger associative memory between scent and source.</p> \n<p>For beauty and body care, this trend allows for magic-infused formulations like shampoos to \u201creveal your inner warrior goddess\u201d or lotions \u201cenchanted by the Northern Lights.\u201d Candles and room sprays provide a literal atmosphere when burning notes like basalm fir or frosted pinecones. And gifting potential persists in tactical sets themed to wood nymphs, frozen landscapes, and flowing capes.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Overall, the winter 2024 fragrance trends offer exciting avenues for retailers to explore innovative scents while delivering on classic consumer expectations. By covering healing notes to holiday gourmands, affordable opulence to imaginative nature-based profiles, brands can imbue function and emotion across beauty, body, and home formats. Monitor emerging interest in citrus and medicinal fragrances, while investing in proven demand for Nordic-inspired and gourmand trends. Most importantly, focus on the full experience from naming to packaging, samples, sound and visuals. Curating immersive and meaningful scent-based products guarantees sustained relevancy.</p> \n"}]}

Both the \u201cHealthy Glow\u201d and \u201cSunburnt Blush\u201d trends spotlight radiant, multi-dimensional complexions with a light flush of color. At Chanel and MSGM, models wore ultra-sheer skin tints and foundations to reveal their natural luminosity. Flushed cheek colors in bright pops or soft diffusions added dimension.</p> \n<p>When developing complexion products for the warmer months, lean into illuminating formulas that mimic light within skin. Sheer tints with buildable coverage, satin finishes and \u201cyour skin but better\u201d claims should take priority over full coverage matte foundations. Prioritize luminosity and transparency. For cheeks, creamy gel and liquid blush formulas blend seamlessly into the complexion\u2019s radiance. Add sun-kissed warmth through bronze and coral shades.</p> \n<p>The no-makeup makeup look relies on prepping skin effectively and matching seamless base products for an even, naturally vibrant finish. Sheer coverage helps retain the complexion\u2019s healthy glow without needing to overload on highlighter. For blush, use a dampened makeup sponge to softly press onto the high points of cheeks and blend out any edges. Summertime beauty embraces effortless, light-reflecting radiance.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Spring/Summer 2024 beauty trends cover a wide scope, from barely-there subtlety to vivid graphic statements. Connecting the extremes, flawless skin paves the way for versatility across markets. Buildable color cosmetics, multi-textural hair care and ocean-inspired accents also bridge wearability from real life to runway. As retailers evaluate seasonal assortments, strong crossover potential stands out through products promoting healthy-looking luminosity, touchable lived-in texture and unexpected pops of aquatic color or geometric liner. Vibrant yet achievable beauty offers something for everyone headed into sunny S/S 2024.</p> \n"}]}

They are fantastic for adding loose powders, body shimmers, powder foundations, and blushes.</p> \n<h2>What to consider when choosing which makeup brushes to sell</h2> \n<h3>Quality over quantity</h3> \n<p>Consumers don\u2019t need many brushes to achieve the perfect look (unless they\u2019re beauty professionals), so it pays for retailers to prioritize quality over quantity. In addition, expensive brushes don\u2019t always offer the best quality.</p> \n<p>Sellers must however ensure that the brushes they choose are durable enough to withstand constant use, including secure bristles that won\u2019t fall out after prolonged use.</p> \n<p>The brushes should also be easy to clean and maintain, which helps to ensure longevity. Remember that brushes are a long-term investment for consumers, so make sure they are getting the best quality for their money.</p> \n<h3>Bristle type</h3> \n<p>You could argue that a makeup brush\u2019s bristles are the most important part of the brush, significantly impacting the user\u2019s application and overall look.</p> \n<p>Bristles come in in two main types: natural and synthetic bristles. Natural bristles are made from animal hair, typically squirrel, goat, sable, or horse. They\u2019re popular for their softness, which helps to perfectly blend and diffuse makeup products.</p> \n<p>In contrast, consumers who are concerned about allergic reactions may want to opt for synthetic bristles. Usually made out of nylon or taklon, they\u2019re popular for their affordability and durability, which is not to say that their effect can\u2019t match that of natural bristles.</p> \n<h3>Avoid sets</h3> \n<p>Although it\u2019s tempting to stock up on brush sets, most consumers opt for individual products instead, so they may not be the most profitable investment. Many consumers avoid sets because they believe that they contain brushes they won\u2019t need during their makeup journey.</p> \n<p>So, it\u2019s safer to focus investing efforts on single brushes or pairs, which have a higher chance of catching your target audience\u2019s attention. If sellers are looking to sell to younger, less experienced users, they\u2019ll likely want to stock these brushes:</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Makeup brushes are an absolute must-have for consumers interested in cosmetics. However, the type of products they\u2019ll need slightly depends on their experience level and type of look they want to achieve.</p> \n<p>For example, professionals and makeup enthusiasts will want to stock as broad a range of tools as possible. Meanwhile, beginners or casual makeup lovers are more likely to buy a few key brushes and will avoid sets.</p> \n<p>Regardless, makeup brushes are a profitable investment if done right.

Consumers are now seeking out gentler hair cleansers, washes, rinses, and co-washes that use ingredients like apple cider vinegar, honey, and rice water. These products promise to clean hair without stripping it of natural oils. The trend presents an opportunity for brands to offer simpler, non-harsh formulas that still effectively cleanse hair. Shoppers want healthy hair and scalps without compromising efficacy or convenience. New adjacent categories like hair wipes and dry conditioner powders are also emerging to meet demand for effortless upkeep and flexibility between washes. Products that embrace the hair-health-first mindset and creativity of the no-poo movement stand to thrive.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. No-poo 1012. From the pantry formulas3. Hardworking hybrids4. No-wash innovations5. Final words</p> \n<h2>No-poo 101</h2> \n<p>So what exactly is no-poo? It refers to completely skipping shampoo and embracing gentler ways of cleansing hair. The no-poo movement breaks down into three main approaches: no-poo, low-poo, and co-wash.</p> \n<p>True no-poo involves using just water or homemade cleansers like apple cider vinegar or baking soda to wash hair. It originated in the curly hair community, which found that sulfates and other harsh shampoo chemicals caused more frizz and dryness. No-poo devotees believe that scalp oils naturally cleanse hair over time without stripping agents.</p> \n<p>Low-poo takes a moderate stance \u2013 lathering hair care is still used but without sulfates or other drying ingredients. The goal is to cleanse gently while retaining some moisture.</p> \n<p>Finally, co-washing relies on conditioners that can double as cleansing agents. These 2-in-1 products let consumers skip shampoo while still washing hair. Co-washes are often thicker, creamier conditioners that emulsify and dissolve dirt, oil, and product buildup when massaged into the scalp.</p> \n<p>While no-poo has recently gained traction in the mainstream, these techniques have long been used, especially among consumers with texture-prone hair. No matter the specific method, the rise of no-poo signifies a shift towards hair care that nourishes over stripping. Brands have an opportunity to think beyond traditional shampoos and offer products that speak to healthy hair and scalps.</p> \n<h2>From the pantry formulas</h2> \n<p>The no-poo movement takes inspiration from home pantries and kitchens. Natural cleaning staples like apple cider vinegar, honey, and baking soda are now starring in hair care formulas too. These ingredients offer gentler cleansing than typical shampoos \u2013 removing dirt and buildup without lathering agents or sulfates.</p> \n<p>ACV cleansers provide antimicrobial properties and can increase shine. Honey moisturizes hair while taming unwanted oils for cleaner-feeling locks. And baking soda works to absorb excess oils, lift dirt, and soothe scalps.\u00a0 Brands like R+Co and Gisou build entire formulas around these natural all-star ingredients.</p> \n<p>Beyond pantry basics, brands also look to time-tested beauty products used globally for generations on hair and skin. For example, oriental beauty company Inala features rice water sourced from Italy in a signature rinse. And packaging and branding for products like these lean into the theme of centuries-old beauty remedies passed down through cultures.</p> \n<p>There is still room for innovation though. Instead of delivering all action topically, supplements could nourish locks from within with hair-targeted vitamins and nutrients. It provides a more holistic approach \u2013 balancing external care with internal repair. Shoppers continue seeking healthier scalps and strands, so no-poo adjacent innovations will likely receive interest too.</p> \n<h2>Hardworking hybrids</h2> \n<p>Hybrid products are essential to streamline routines amidst the no-poo movement. With consumers washing their hair less frequently, each step must maximize results. Two-in-one co-washes for cleansing and conditioning lead the charge as heroes here.</p> \n<p>Brands like Arkive sell concentrated co-wash products specifically for the no-poo consumer who still wants clean, nourished hair. These creams, gels, oils, and balms emulsify when applied to the scalp \u2013 dissolving dirt and buildup like a shampoo. Then, additional emollients in them smooth and hydrate the lengths and ends.</p> \n<p>Some innovative formulas even push the limits of \u201chybrid\u201d to perform more actions in one step. Take Oasis:skin\u2019s powder wash that cleanses and conditions hair while also rinsing away as a body and face cleanser. This and other hybrid hair care formulations help streamline grooming routines substantially. They save consumers time while still caring for all their needs in one fell swoop.</p> \n<p>For brands though, achieving this is a delicate balancing act. No-poo products must first and foremost cleanse hair excellently. So performance should trump extraneous benefits in importance. Still, creative hybrids that simplify regimens will find interest from the convenience-seeking shopper.</p> \n<h2>No-wash innovations</h2> \n<p>The no-poo movement goes beyond shampoo replacements \u2013 it\u2019s also driving innovation in products that help consumers extend time between washes. Brands are getting creative with formats like hair wipes, dry shampoo alternatives, and other wash-extending necessities.</p> \n<p>Hair wipes provide targeted cleansing of dirt, oil, and product buildup between washes. Brands like Hair by Sam McKnight offer biodegradable hair cleansing cloths with ingredients like witch hazel and aloe vera. These wipes refresh hair on the go, whether after the gym or before a night out.</p> \n<p>Dry shampoo alternatives similarly refresh hair but via novel formats like loose powders or creams. Batiste\u2019s dry conditioner allows for lightweight moisturizing between washes without an aerosol spray. And I Dew Care\u2019s powder format with a built-in puff applicator caters to active, busy lifestyles.</p> \n<p>Supplements also help bolster hair health between washes by delivering nutrients internally. Brands like Nutrafol and The Mane Choice offer hair-targeted vitamins to complement their cleansing products.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the no-wash innovations let consumers better care for their hair on their own terms. Shoppers now demand flexibility and customization of routines instead of following prescribed product regimens. Brands would do well to provide solutions that give control back to the consumer \u2013 letting them decide when and how to enhance their hair\u2019s health.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The no-poo movement shows no signs of slowing down. As a retailer, be sure to stock gentler hair cleansers, washes and rinses to meet this demand. Seek out natural ingredient-based formulas free of harsh sulfates. Also consider carrying co-wash options which cover cleansing and conditioning in one efficient step. And don\u2019t forget convenient no-wash adjacents like hair refreshing wipes or dry conditioner powders. Catering to hair-health-focused shoppers rejecting traditional shampoos presents a meaningful opportunity right now.</p> \n"}]}

Targeted solutions that tackle the skin effects of everyday stressors are appealing to wider mainstream and Gen Z audiences. This article explores key trends driving the growth.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Supplements augment skincare routines2. Ingestible suncare for year-round protection3. Creative formats draw new consumers4. Intimate care fosters health and happiness5. Stress and skin: The mind-body link</p> \n<h2>1. Supplements augment skincare routines</h2> \n<p>Beauty supplements are shifting from a niche add-on to a normal part of skincare and wellness routines. No longer viewed as an extra step for the ultra-committed, ingestibles now have mainstream appeal as consumers take a more holistic, inside-out approach to beauty and self-care.</p> \n<p>This is being driven by several interconnected trends. With growing awareness of the gut-skin axis and how nutrition impacts skin health, supplements are now seen as a logical extension of topical skincare. The COVID-19 pandemic also accelerated usage as consumers sought new wellness solutions amid lockdowns. And above all, modern lifestyles are taking their toll \u2013 consumers are tackling more daily stress, and looking to supplements to mitigate the effects.</p> \n<p>Brands now have a real opportunity to leverage supplements to complement their skincare offerings. But education remains vital \u2013 consumers need clear messaging that ingestibles augment topical care rather than replace it. Fun formats and targeted, stress-busting formulas also help to draw new audiences. Overall though, supplements now interlock with beauty routines for many consumers seeking to care for their whole self \u2013 inside and out.</p> \n<h2>2.Ingestiblesuncare for year-round protection</h2> \n<p>UV damage was once seen as a seasonal skincare concern, but with climate change extending sunny days and consumers more informed about sun risks, suncare has become a daily essential. While mineral sunscreens form an important protective barrier, mess-free suncare supplements are emerging as a convenient way to provide additional defense against sensitivity and premature aging.</p> \n<p>Ingestible suncare works by supporting the skin\u2019s natural mechanisms. Supplements like ORBIS\u2019s Sun Period contain antioxidants that protect skin cells and DNA against UV damage. Others like Wild Nutrition\u2019s Natural Glow stimulate melanin production for a lasting golden glow. Next-generation ingredients even shield against issues like sun allergies \u2013 Dr. Barbara Sturm\u2019s oral supplement Sun Skin helps prevent reactions like prickly heat.</p> \n<p>Suncare supplements should augment sun protection routines, not replace them \u2013 education on safe sun practices is still vital. But for consumers looking for a low-maintenance backup to topical SPF, ingestibles represent an easy way to defend skin health year-round. And the category has room to grow as climate change continues to intensify.</p> \n<h2>3. Creative formats draw new consumers</h2> \n<p>While capsules and powders once dominated beauty supplements, creative new formats like gummies and jellies are helping attract younger, mainstream audiences. With their playful, candy-like appeal and lower commitment bar, these innovative delivery methods are less intimidating for supplement newbies.</p> \n<p>East Asian brands have pioneered jellied supplements packed with collagen and hyaluronic acid. Singapore\u2019s Avance says their jelly format appeals to hesitant younger consumers, turning a functional health product into a tasty treat. The US is now following suit \u2013 personalized brand Nourished recently added sour gummy \u201cSkinStacks\u201d to make supplements more fun.</p> \n<p>Even quicker-acting options are emerging \u2013 edible dissolvable films and chewable tabs provide a hit of nutrients on the go. And transdermal vitamin patches allow consumers to \u201csignal\u201d self-care to others. With designs ranging from lightning bolts to mushrooms, these visible statements help remove the stigma around supplements.</p> \n<p>While ingestible beauty remains relatively new, playful formats dispel reservations some consumers may harbor. And by turning self-care into a joyful, low-stakes experience, they allow a wider audience to explore the category.</p> \n<h2>4. Intimate care fosters health and happiness</h2> \n<p>An emerging subset of supplements aims to enhance sexual wellness and vaginal health. As intimate care sheds longstanding taboos, consumers are exploring products tailored to needs downstairs \u2013 both for confidence in the bedroom and general well-being.</p> \n<p>Stress and hormonal shifts impact vaginal ecology, causing conditions like irritating yeast infections. Probiotic supplements can restore balance, as with April\u2019s VJJ Hero capsules formulated for the vulva and vagina. Libido-lifting supplements are also taking off \u2013 Dame\u2019s Desire gummies and Maude\u2019s nightly supplement both use natural aphrodisiacs to increase arousal and satisfaction.</p> \n<p>The intimate care category offers holistic beauty opportunities too. ZitStika\u2019s Mood Food gummies tackle monthly acne flares by soothing PMS symptoms and regulating hormones. While Equi London\u2019s menopause formula aids issues like hormonal aging and vaginal dryness during this transition.</p> \n<p>So supplements supporting underserved intimate needs represent huge potential as consumers embrace sexual self-care. Those offering both reproductive and aesthetic benefits also align with the rising psychodermatology trend. Partnering with medical experts helps validate claims in this sensitive space while increasing trust.</p> \n<h2>5. Stressandskin: The mind-body link</h2> \n<p>Modern lifestyles are taking a toll on mental well-being, and consumers are making the connection between stress and its effects on the skin. This has led to rising interest in psychodermatology products that care for both the mind and complexion.</p> \n<p>Chronic stress contributes to various skin issues like accelerated aging, acne, eczema, and hair loss. It impacts hormone regulation and interrupts cellular renewal processes. So beauty supplements are evolving to address root causes by supporting the nervous system and stress response.</p> \n<p>Nootropic supplements feature adaptogens and calming amino acids to manage cortisol spikes from daily pressures. Herbar\u2019s Skin Pearls ward off damage from fatigue and anxiety this way while improving mood. Targeted solutions like Veracity\u2019s cortisol-lowering formula also help consumers cope with modern demands.</p> \n<p>Stress-busting supplements ultimately bridge the mind-body link increasingly acknowledged in dermatology circles. As lifestyles show no signs of slowing, consumers need multi-pronged self-care that attends to both mental and skin health through this psychodermatology approach.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>With targeted benefits that complement topical routines and bridge the mind-skin connection, beauty supplements are gaining mass appeal as consumers embrace holistic self-care.

That\u2019s why nursing pads exist as a solution to help mothers control leaks and maintain hygiene throughout the lactation process.</p> \n<p>On top of this, nursing pads have caught the attention of consumers with a consistent monthly following of 22,200 search queries since 2022.</p> \n<p>So if you want to learn how to pick the best nursing pads, then read on for how to source\u00a0 nursing pads that are set to boost profits in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are nursing pads, and why do mothers need them?What are the different types of nursing pads?4 factors to consider when stocking up on nursing padsFinal words</p> \n<h2>What are nursing pads, and why do mothers need them?</h2> \n<p>Nursing pads, or breast pads, are little pieces of fabric placed inside a bra to absorb milk leaking from the breast. They work the same way as towels do. But instead of soaking up sweat, nursing pads soak up breast milk.</p> \n<p>Below are a few reasons why consumers need nursing pads:</p> \n<h2>What are the different types of nursing pads?</h2> \n<h3>Disposable nursing pads</h3> \n<p>Nursing mothers already have their hands full, and laundry is the last agenda on their busy schedule. Withdisposable nursing pads, consumers have a convenient single-use option.</p> \n<p>So when the pad is soaked, consumers don\u2019t have to struggle with the washer. They can simply throw out the used pad and pull another one from the pack. Althoughdisposable nursing padsare grade A in low maintenance, they are not the most environmentally friendly choice.</p> \n<h3>Reusable nursing pads</h3> \n<p>Not all consumers can afford to dispose of and buy nursing pads constantly\u2014soreusable onesoffer a pocket-friendly alternative!</p> \n<p>After a one-off purchase, consumers can wash and storereusable nursing padsfor daily use. However, some consumers may find reusable nursing pads labor-intensive due to the need for regular washing.</p> \n<h3>Silicone pads</h3> \n<p>These nursing padsoffer something different. Instead of being absorbent, they apply gentle pressure to reduce the chances of leaks. Silicone nursing pads also have sticky surfaces so mothers can wear them with or without a bra.</p> \n<p>Some women prefersilicone nursing padsbecause they fit perfectly under fancy clothing and work for swimming. Some variants also come with designs to help collect breast milk if it spills.</p> \n<h2>4 factors to consider when stocking up on nursing pads</h2> \n<h3>Comfort</h3> \n<p>Retailers must prioritize comfort when choosingnursing padsbecause women wear them for long hours\u2014so anything less than comfortable will irritate the sensitive breast skin. The ideal comfortable nursing pad should be soft, breathable, and cushioned enough to support the breasts.</p> \n<p>The best materials to prioritize for comfort include cotton, bamboo, microfiber, and silicone. They\u2019ll help ensure mothers enjoy a relaxed breastfeeding experience when using nursing pads made from them.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Women with a busy schedule will find comfortable nursing pads more adaptable. In general, nursing pads with plastic liners, non-breathable materials, harsh chemicals, and adhesive backing will make wearing them uncomfortable. So, businesses must avoid stocking up on such nursing pads to offer issue-free experiences.</p> \n<h3>Absorbent</h3> \n<p>The main reason consumers purchase nursing pads is because they want to prevent the visible embarrassment of clothes getting wet from leakage. But nursing pads can\u2019t do that if they aren\u2019t absorbent.</p> \n<p>When sourcingnursing pads, businesses must ensure that they have moisture retention capabilities to protect clothes and bras from unexpected milk flow.</p> \n<p>Absorbent nursing pads utilize good layering to lock in moisture. For example, nursing pads have a hygroscopic inner layer that helps maintain dryness and prevent stains.</p> \n<h3>Coverage</h3> \n<p>Nursing padsdo not come in universal sizes. They must offer enough coverage to shield the breast and prevent leakage. For such situations, businesses must provide nursing pads that fit perfectly in their target consumer\u2019s bra size.</p> \n<p>For example, nursing pads designed for sports bras must provide enough coverage without sticking out.\u00a0 And if they\u2019re for lace bras, nursing pads should be smooth enough to provide discreet coverage.</p> \n<h3>Contoured design</h3> \n<p>Women will always gravitate toward nursing pads with contoured designs for a more natural feel. Since breasts are round, offering flat nursing pads would be unconventional.</p> \n<p>Contoured nursing padscup the wearer\u2019s breasts like bras and will sit flush on their skin without moving around or bunching. As a result, such nursing pads are completely discreet\u2014no one would know mothers even have them on.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Lactation is challenging to manage. Like changingdiapers, mothers must be conscious of leakages to avoid embarrassment or other health issues from keeping breasts in moist bras.</p> \n<p>Luckily, nursing pads are the perfect hygiene aid to help lactating women control leakage, deal with discomfort from sensitive nipples, and boost confidence. However, offering nursing pads requires more than choosing the types.</p> \n<p>Businesses must also consider all the factors discussed in this article. That way, they can rest assured that their inventories will be ready to handle the surging demand when sales kick off in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Meanwhile, salons and beauty parlors, spas, health and wellness centers, hospitals, and homes make up the majority of the market by application.</p> \n<p>Market growth is being driven by thriving online beauty and wellness content, a greater awareness of the benefits of facial steaming, and increased spending on luxury skincare products.</p> \n<p>According to revenue generated in 2019, North America dominates the global facial steamer market, followed by Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.</p> \n<h2>Top 5 at-home facial steamers to consider</h2> \n<p>Ideal at-home facial steamers must encompass a number of indispensable features to make the \u201ctop\u201d cut. Here are five functionalities and features to consider:</p> \n<h3>1. Nano steam</h3> \n<p>Nano steamerscan increase blood circulation by up to 10 times, giving users glowing skin. The tiny steam particles penetrate the skin deeper than regular-sized steam, hydrating it more deeply. As a result, skin looks dewy and refreshed, with reduced fine lines.</p> \n<p>Each nano-steaming session makes the skin softer and opens the pores, making it a beneficial foundation for other skincare routines.</p> \n<p>Choose a nano facial steamer that provides consistent steam for at least five minutes, giving your customers control over how long each steam session lasts.</p> \n<h3>2. Hot and cold facial mists</h3> \n<p>Hot mists help to soften blackheads for easy removal. It also opens pores, allowing serums, masks, and other beauty products to cleanse more effectively.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, cold steam soothes inflamed or sunburned skin by cooling the outer layer of the skin. This then allows application of aftersun cream on dampened skin. The cold feature also tightens pores after cleansing, resulting in a smoother skin tone.</p> \n<p>When choosing afacial steamer with these features, try to opt for one that heats up rapidly, as this is a sign of quality. However, it should be noted that steamers with a larger water capacity may also take longer to heat up.</p> \n<h3>3. LED therapy spa treatment</h3> \n<p>Facial steamerswith blue and red LEDs can offer users anat-home therapy spa experience.</p> \n<p>Red light therapy stimulates collagen production, giving the skin strength, elasticity, and structure. Blue light therapy treats acne and soothes the skin, making it suitable for use after rigorous skincare routines.</p> \n<p>This combination of therapies provides comprehensive skincare benefits, making facial steamers a valuable addition to any skincare routine.</p> \n<p>Also, look for facial steamers with a biowave massager. This helps to tighten the skin and aids a youthful appearance.</p> \n<h3>4. 6-mode smart steam technology</h3> \n<p>At-home facial steamers with smart steam technology havesix different modes:</p> \n<p>Facial steamers with these features combine a rich cleansing routine with a great sensory experience.</p> \n<p>Smart steam technology is perfect for customers who want to customize their skincare routines based on their skin\u2019s needs and existing regimen.</p> \n<h3>5. Aromatherapy and humidifiers</h3> \n<p>Customers can enhance their at-home facial steaming experience with essential oils like lavender, chamomile, and more. This simple addition offers aromatherapy benefits like helping to relax the user\u2019s eyes after prolonged screen time.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that not all aromatherapy steamers have a dedicated water chamber. Some facial steamers come with aromatherapy, many come with facial humidifiers, and some have both.</p> \n<p>Facial humidifiers specifically add moisture to the air, making steaming more comfortable and providing additional moisture for dry and itchy skin, which is particularly useful during the cold winter months.</p> \n<h2>Other considerations when choosing at-home facial steamers</h2> \n<p>After choosing the functions and features that will best serve your customers, you\u2019ll want to recommend specific models based on their lifestyle and preferences. Below are three other factors that customers will look for according to their skin type and needs.</p> \n<h3>1. Size and portability</h3> \n<p>The right size face steamer for your customer will depend on their lifestyle and preferences. Travelers will benefit from smaller and lighter models, while heavier models are better suited to the home, where mobility is less important.</p> \n<h3>2. Water capacity and runtime</h3> \n<p>A facial steamer\u2019s capacity to produce steam depends on how much water it can hold. In addition to providing longer runtimes, larger tanks allow for longer steaming periods before the need to refill.</p> \n<p>However, smaller tanks are likely sufficient for customers who prefer shorter sessions or have limited time for their skincare routines.</p> \n<p>Ask customers about their routines and usage patterns to recommend the perfect steamer and appropriate water capacity.</p> \n<h3>3. Temperature control</h3> \n<p>Steamers with various settings and temperature controls allow customers better flexibility to choose options that suit their skin types and preferences. For example, steamers with a mild steam option are more suitable for sensitive skin types.</p> \n<p>However, higher temperature settings will benefit congested and oily skin types. Choose steamers that offer various temperature settings so that they better meet the needs of different users.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Besides increasing the effectiveness of skincare products, at-home facial steamers also rejuvenate the skin.</p> \n<p>When purchasing facial steamers for your store, be sure to look for those that include LEDs, aromatherapy, or humidifiers. These features can help customers achieve their desired results faster and more effectively.</p> \n<p>Additionally, look for steamers with adjustable speeds and timers so customers can personalize their treatments.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re on the market for cutting-edge facial steamers like those listed above, look no further than the thousands of options onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

By utilizing advancing technology like AI and machine learning, companies can formulate customized skincare serums, fragrances, cosmetics and more based on factors ranging from skin type and tone to lifestyle and preferences. This approach also boosts inclusivity, with underserved demographics receiving products tailored specifically for them. As consumers increasingly demand hyper-personalization and conscious consumption, made-to-order solutions present an opportunity for brands across categories to reduce excess inventory while providing efficacy, sustainability and an elevated customer experience.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Innovations in custom skincare solutions2. Slow fragrance for conscious consumers3. Promoting inclusivity through personalization4. The potential of customizable cosmetics5. Final thoughts</p> \n<h2>Innovations in custom skincare solutions</h2> \n<p>The skincare category is seeing exciting innovations in made-to-order products powered by advancing tech. AI-driven customization allows brands to formulate hyper-personalized serums based on individual skincare needs and preferences. By analyzing selfies and questionnaires, algorithms can detect factors like skin type, tone, and sensitivity to design bespoke products. Brands like South Korean conglomerate Amorepacific\u2019s Custom.me and Proven in the US are utilizing this tech to take the guesswork out of skincare and deliver maximal, targeted results.</p> \n<p>Dermatologist-designed brands are also expanding into prescription skincare custom-made for each user. These planet-friendly solutions come in minimal, waste-reducing packaging aligned with the made-to-order ethos. UK-based Skin + Me packages its tailored daily serum in an aluminum bottle containing the exact monthly dose. The unique twist-click dispenser releases just the right amount of product needed per day.</p> \n<p>Beyond topicals, brands are exploring holistic inner-outer skincare through personalized supplements. Neutrogena and UK supplement brand Nourished have partnered on SkinStacks \u2013 3D-printed gummies with skin-enhancing nutrients tailored to each user based on their unique Skin360 app analysis. DNA testing takes customization even further, with brands like Belgium\u2019s Nomige and UK\u2019s DNAfit formulating one-of-a-kind supplements to address genetic nutritional deficiencies. As technology unlocks new opportunities in bespoke beauty, skincare is leading a revolution in efficacy and sustainability.</p> \n<h2>Slow fragrance for conscious consumers</h2> \n<p>In the fragrance category, natural and indie brands are capturing eco-conscious Gen Z and Millennials through made-to-order scents produced in limited batches. This appeals to younger generations who view fragrance as an expression of identity and crave differentiation. Brands are embracing seasonality and exclusivity to align with shifting attitudes.</p> \n<p>UK-based Ffern epitomizes this through its ledger program \u2013 customers receive four seasonal fragrances yearly, blended and barrel-aged on-site in Somerset. Production is capped based on ledger enrollment, selling out when inventory is depleted for an aura of scarcity. Belgium\u2019s Kamila Aubre also produces micro-batches of botanical perfumes, never exceeding 10 units to retain artisanship.</p> \n<p>Allowing direct consumer participation, Experimental Perfume Club empowers shoppers to mix their signature scent either with perfumers or in at-home kits. Users select from preexisting fragrances to combine into a custom formula that can be reordered.</p> \n<p>Brands are also harnessing tech to attach sentimental meaning to smells via memory. NoOrdinary in Sweden captures highly personal recollections through an AI robot that evaluates images to design one-of-a-kind perfumes. As younger generations demand products resonating with their identities, indie fragrance brands are positioning made-to-order as the future of sustainable, emotional and evocative scent.</p> \n<h2>Promoting inclusivity through personalization</h2> \n<p>Made-to-order beauty allows for greater diversity and inclusion by expanding product ranges to serve demographics overlooked by mainstream brands. Through customization, companies can increase shade offerings for BIPOC consumers and cater to a multiplicity of hair types and skin tones. AI-powered personalization also improves accessibility by mitigating unsuitable product choices.</p> \n<p>Yuty demonstrates this by matching users to their ideal items after analyzing genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. The algorithm scans products to provide tailored picks that regularly update with the user\u2019s changing needs. This technology removes barriers and simplifies product selection.</p> \n<p>In color cosmetics, inadequate foundation shades continue plaguing inclusion. However, brands like UK\u2019s Dcypher are addressing this through made-to-order custom blending. Users submit images of their skin which are run through a patent-pending mixer to create the perfect match per their coverage and finish preferences.</p> \n<p>Beyond products, platforms are also employing personalization to better serve marginalized communities through education and advice. Carra offers hair coaching for those with afro and curly textures, while Oak has an in-depth hair profiling tool specifying care instructions and compatible products for different hair types.</p> \n<p>By tapping into inclusive customization, brands can severely reduce excess inventory from unsuitable shades while making beauty more welcoming for all. Putting diversity and self-expression first is imperative.</p> \n<h2>The potential of customizable cosmetics</h2> \n<p>Cosmetics present a major opportunity for waste reduction through made-to-order customization. With 120 billion units of packaging generated yearly, enabling consumers to purchase only what they need could significantly lower excess inventory. The more a product resonates with user preferences, the less likely returns or non-use also become.</p> \n<p>Refillable packaging incentivizes repurchasing customized products. F.S. Korea\u2019s It\u2019s Go Brush features replaceable components in the user\u2019s choice of colors. MOB Beauty takes a different approach, allowing shoppers to build their own refillable, biodegradable palettes showcasing ethical ingredients.</p> \n<p>French brand La Bouche Rouge brings custom color cosmetics to lip products \u2013 clients pick from hundreds of shades for their lipstick case. Adding a personalized name provides a playful final touch. Stateside, Lip Lab offers in-store consultations to test and name custom lip colors that can then be reordered directly.</p> \n<p>Looking ahead, tech-based solutions could provide unlimited customization opportunities and give consumers creative license. YSL Beauty\u2019s Rouge Sur Mesure device houses a patented system turning three pigments into over 4,000 potential shades using proprietary cartridges. As formulations, packaging, naming and more become customer-driven, cosmetics brands embracing imaginative made-to-order solutions will futureproof growth.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Made-to-order allows brands across beauty categories to offer exceptional personalization and efficacy while eliminating excess inventory and waste. By harnessing advances in customization technology and reusable packaging, companies can formulate products catering to individual consumer preferences for skin type, hair texture, scent profiles and more. While sustainability remains a key driver, made-to-order also unlocks newpossibilities for self-expression, inclusivity and emotional resonance through beauty. As consumer values continue shifting towards conscious consumption, bespoke products provide an innovative solution seamlessly aligning business, experience and environmental interests.</p> \n"}]}

From lazy, glowing skin to colorful graphic eyeliner shapes, there were plenty of exciting new looks. As an online retailer, being aware of these trends will allow you to curate products aligned with what will be popular over the next several months. This will keep your inventory fresh and appealing to customers looking for of-the-moment beauty inspiration. Read on for an overview of five key trends straight from the catwalks that you can start bringing into your product mix today.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. LazyBeauty continues its reign2. Graphic liners transform eyes3. Hair sculptures defy gravity4. Short nails make a comeback5. Winter Brights add color6. Final words</p> \n<h2>LazyBeauty continues its reign</h2> \n<p>The \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup trend shows no signs of slowing down, as fresh-faced, effortless beauty was once again a prominent aesthetic across the A/W 23/24 runways. Dubbed LazyBeauty, this look focuses on glowy, dewy skin with barely-there makeup that appears hastily applied. Models and designers seem to be saying goodbye to intricate routines and embracing the freedom of imperfect yet natural beauty.</p> \n<p>This season\u2019s LazyBeauty vibe centered on muted tones that subtly enhanced rather than drastically altered features. Cheeks were warmed ever so slightly with soft terracotta and skin was perfected not covered with light-diffusing tinted moisturizers and hydrating foundations. Eyes focused on fluttery mascaras, smudgy eyeliners, and shimmering champagne lids that catch the light. Lips took on organics hues with just-bitten stains and balmy glosses. Even hair reflected the low-maintenance attitude with undone textures, middle partings, and effortless waves.</p> \n<p>To help your customers easily achieve LazyBeauty\u2019s simplifed aesthetic for A/W 23/24, stock lightweight complexion enhancers, multi-use gel pot rouges, clear or tinted brow gels, creamy shadow crayons, and nourishing lip oils. Market these products with messaging around enhancing natural beauty and freeing up time previously spent on intricate beauty routines. Emphasize the trend\u2019s focus on self-acceptance rather than chasing perfection. LazyBeauty\u2019s fresh-faced radiance is about feeling comfortable in your own skin.</p> \n<h2>Graphic liners transform eyes</h2> \n<p>While lazy, low-key makeup may have dominated the recent catwalks, graphic liner was also going strong for A/W 23/24. Dramatic feline flicks, bold abstract shapes, and unexpected pops of color around the eyes contrasted with pared back skin and lips to create major focal points. This playful trend transforms the eye area into a canvas for self-expression.</p> \n<p>Many designers embellished models with rounded cloud-like loops, angled checkerboard prints, and geometric doll-like designs using liquid and pencil liners. Both monochromatic and multi-colored looks added artistic flair. Negative space was also utilized to make empty areas pop as much the graphic lines themselves. Uma Wang, Act N.1, and Priscavera were among the runways spotlighting these creative liner applications.</p> \n<p>To help your customers experiment with graphic liner shapes for A/W 23/24, offer a curated selection of vivid liquid and retractable liners that glide smoothly onto lids and rims. Matte and metallic finishes in unexpected hues like seafoam green, candy pink, and cyber yellow are ideal. Market these graphic liners as quick, commitment-free ways to explore self-expression. Suggest layering colors and using stencils to achieve different patterns. Creative liner looks are all about having fun while making a personal style statement.</p> \n<h2>Hair sculptures defy gravity</h2> \n<p>Gravity-defying hair sculptures brought an avant-garde edge to the A/W 23/24 catwalks. Structured shapes that seemingly floated atop models\u2019 heads added drama and a futuristic feel. From crimped mohawks at Junya Watanabe to teased crown-like spirals at Act N.1, hair was molded, twisted, and tucked into artistic forms.</p> \n<p>Many of these sculptural styles seemed inspired by creations only possible with wigs or extensions. However, innovative styling products let fashion fans achieve similarly bold looks without commitment or damage. Over the past year, TikTok tutorials have spotlighted techniques for faking a short haircut or sculpting hair using clips, ribbons, and temporary coloring.</p> \n<p>To help your customers recreate sculptural hair trends at home, provide all the necessary tools. Think thermal sprays for volume, boar bristle brushes for smooth styling, wide-tooth combs to set shapes, bobby pins to tuck in strands, and reusable velvet scrunchies to achieve an elegantly undone finish. Also offer clip-in hairpieces that instantly add lengths for dramatic silhouettes without cutting. Capture the creativity of the trend in your marketing messages and positioned sculptural hair as a way to take self-expression to new heights.</p> \n<h2>Short nails make a comeback</h2> \n<p>Though long, embellished nails still captivated at Fashion Week, one of the biggest nail trends was a return to short nails. Spotted on the runways of designers like Mark Fast, Naeem Khan, and Off-White, closely trimmed tips often sported black and brown polish for an edgy yet practical look.</p> \n<p>For the past couple years, lengthy talons have been popular across social media and influenced many to embrace high-maintenance salon routines. However, short nails are currently surging on TikTok and Instagram as people praise their convenience and neat appearance. Some influencers even claim shorties help them better type, text, and go about daily activities.</p> \n<p>To appeal to those embracing short nails for A/W23/24, curate polish shades that feel fresh and modern with this pared-back length. Go for darker, moodier tones like emerald, wine, and charcoal as well as eye-catching metallic rose gold and silvery lavender. Also stock nourishing base and top coats to keep short nails healthy and strong. Capture the benefits of this fuss-free trend in your product copy and suggest short nails as the perfect way to experiment with bold colors without the upkeep. Celebrate short nail looks as a symbol of confidence and practicality.</p> \n<h2>Winter Brights add color</h2> \n<p>Though fall and winter often inspire darker, moodier palettes, the A/W 23/24 runways demonstrated that vivid brightness never goes out of style. Pops of eye-catching color on eyes, lips, cheeks, and nails contrasted with black apparel and brought energy to cold weather ensembles. Standout hues included zingy orange at Kiko Kostadinov, seafoam green at Shuting Qiu, and bright fuchsia in multiples shows.</p> \n<p>Color psychology suggests vibrant shades can lift spirits and inspire happiness even on the dreariest days. As many regions face shorter daylight hours and cooler temps, a swipe of vibrant shadow, a dab of cheerful blush, or a mani featuring fun tones reflects optimism. Plus, contrasting bright accents against neutral clothing and coat palettes makes a major style statement.</p> \n<p>Offer your customers ways to incorporate uplifting winter brights with products in jewel tones, icy pastels, and punchy primaries. Suggest single bold lips or nails so color doesn\u2019t overwhelm. Also, curate small shadow and blush palettes with bright pops so people can switch up looks. Capture the mood-boosting magic of winter brights in your marketing messages. Consumers will appreciate you helping them spark self-expression this coming chillier season.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The recent Fashion Week runways revealed an array of exciting and innovative beauty trends for the upcoming A/W 23/24 season. By keeping these top five trends on your radar and stocking aligned products, you\u2019ll appeal to customers looking for cutting edge inspiration. Focus on multi-use makeup hybrids that simplify routines as well as vivid colors that enliven neutral winter palettes. Most importantly, encourage playful experimentation \u2013 the overarching vibe from the catwalks celebrated creativity, self-expression and embracing the unexpected. Let your product mix and messaging reflect that adventurous spirit.</p> \n"}]}

An interesting development is deodorant mists that allow perspiration while combating odor-causing bacteria. Brands like Athletia Beauty offer refreshing deodorant sprays to encourage \u201ccomfortable sweating.\u201d These provide odor protection without curbing natural perspiration needed to cool the body during exercise.</p> \n<p>All-over deodorizing lotions are also gaining ground, designed to glide onto areas prone to sweat like the back and chest. Superdrip\u2019s 5-in-1 Sweat Rescue lotion promises to dry quickly without stickiness, making it ideal for vigorous workouts. Stick and spray deodorant formats are also on the rise for their ease of application on the move.</p> \n<p>Another major opportunity is supplements that provide an extra boost pre-workout. Asystem creates \u201cscience-forward supplements for active lifestyles\u201d with ingredients like cordyceps to enhance energy.</p> \n<p>For retailers, consider exploring new deodorant formats beyond traditional sticks, as convenient application is key. Also look into the fast-growing supplement space for pre-workout enhancers. With the right innovations in formulas and formats, there are exciting possibilities to help consumers power through their fitness regimens in comfort.</p> \n<h2>Speedy skin and hair post-gym</h2> \n<p>With busy, active lifestyles on the rise, convenient products that quickly refresh skin and hair after workouts are in demand. These new innovations save time for on-the-go consumers seeking seamless post-gym routines.</p> \n<p>Skin spritzes and mists are proving popular for their portability and fast application. OffCourt\u2019s aluminum-free body sprays function as deodorant and cologne in one, with sophisticated scents and deodorizing properties. Lumion\u2019s Miracle Mist can be spritzed on as a facial cleanser to instantly calm irritation and replenish hydration after breaking a sweat.</p> \n<p>For hair, no-rinse and towel-dry solutions eliminate showering.

These items provide soothing relief for overworked muscles, turning recovery into a ritual.</p> \n<p>Topical pain relief and muscle care brands lead the way in effective solutions. The use of aromatherapy also provides comfort \u2013 the brand\u2019s Rest Nightly Lotion combining lavender, geranium, and Epsom salts aims to ease muscles and improve sleep quality.</p> \n<p>Niche items treating skin side effects from frequent exercise are also desirable.

Consider unique applicators that provide massaging benefits, plus aromatherapy and bath products that soothe both body and mind. The ath-beauty market allows for innovative solutions that unite recovery with pampering.</p> \n<h2>Designing solutions for all bodies</h2> \n<p>An exciting shift in the category is more diverse and inclusive ath-beauty products. Previously taboo issues like sweating and chafing are now being addressed for all body types.</p> \n<p>Brands are offering solutions tailored to specific body parts prone to sweating or rubbing. Hiki makes \u201cStop Odor Anywhere\u201d products for folded skin areas like the underarms and thighs. The marketing depicts models of all races and sizes, normalizing issues around sweat.</p> \n<p>Suncare is also becoming more inclusive. Tennis pros Naomi Osaka and Venus Williams have launched sun protection suited for melanin-rich skin. Their brand formulas claim to leave no white cast and stay put through sweat and movement. This helps promote suncare\u2019s importance for all skin tones.</p> \n<p>The position that fitness is only for the already active is fading too. Megababe\u2019s product range tackles problems like chafing \u201cfor those being intentionally active or not\u201d, making self-care approachable. Brands embrace that movement comes in many forms, not just hardcore exercise.</p> \n<p>As ath-beauty expands, retailers have an opportunity to choose brands that speak to a wide range of consumers. Consider suncare that caters to diverse skin types and products addressing issues once deemed unattractive. Alongside function, be sure to evaluate inclusive marketing and branding when curating assortments. The category\u2019s message must resonate with all who see fitness as self-care rather than hardcore performance goals.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>As interest in health and fitness reaches new heights, the ath-beauty category is innovating to meet emerging consumer demands. From convenient performance boosters to muscle recovery rituals, brands are uniting beauty with active lifestyles in creative ways. Alongside function, inclusivity and diversity are becoming integral in targeting products and messaging. With formulations, formats, applicators and more undergoing an evolution, retailers have an exciting opportunity to expand offerings.

It\u2019s all about that wonderful feeling of calm, rejuvenation, and relaxation, pushing many consumers towards facial and spa packages.</p> \n<p>But now, consumers can enjoy that rejuvenating feel from the comfort of home with an ice globe face massager tool. But what is it? An ice globe massager is like a magic wand for facial skin.</p> \n<p>They often consist of a small, handheld globe filled with a gel or liquid that users can freeze and unfreeze easily. Although manufacturers mostly craft the globes from glass, businesses can find variants made from stainless steel (a better solution to the spoon DIY therapy).</p> \n<h3>What benefits do ice globes offer?</h3> \n<p>Ice globes offer many more benefits apart from soothing the user\u2019s skin. They can help reduce the puffiness under their eyes while minimizing any inflammation of their face. But that\u2019s just on the surface. Here\u2019s a deeper look at their benefits:</p> \n<h2>What are the types of ice globes available on the market?</h2> \n<h3>Traditional ice globes</h3> \n<p>Meet the good old classic ice globefacialmassagers. Traditionally, they\u2019re crafted from glass, but businesses can also find them in aluminum, especially newer models. Although they work similarly, both types of traditional ice globes have their subtle differences.</p> \n<p>For instance, most businesses often find glass when searching forclassic ice globes. They\u2019re built to last with tough glass and a non-toxic gel that can freeze without cracking the globe.</p> \n<p>Although the second player in the game (aluminum) is a bit less common, they\u2019re way tougher. In addition to their super durability,aluminum ice globesare more hygienic because they\u2019re easier to clean.</p> \n<p>Traditional ice globescome in various fun shapes\u2014businesses can find them in spheres, cubes, or even hearts. The cool thing is that their shape doesn\u2019t affect how well they work. It\u2019s more about what consumers fancy, so they pick the one that speaks to them the most.</p> \n<p>Google Ads data reveals that classic ice globes hold a significant interest. Consumers have searched for them 14,800 times since 2022, and that figure is the same even in October 2023.</p> \n<h3>Electric/rechargeable ice globes</h3> \n<p>Now, here\u2019s something even better\u2014electric ice globefacial massagers. These are a more recent addition to the ice globe family, and they bring a little extra oomph to the cooling and massaging game using vibrations.</p> \n<p>Consumers can usually pick from two or three vibration settings to set the intensity just how they like it for a comfortable experience.Electric ice globefacial massagers might pinch consumers\u2019 wallets more than traditional ones, but they come with various perks.</p> \n<p>For instance,electric ice globesdraw power from batteries or come with a rechargeable base, allowing them to stay frosty for longer stretches than their old-school counterparts.</p> \n<p>Another great thing about electric ice globes is that consumers don\u2019t have to store them in a freezer\u2014they\u2019re always ready to roll whenever needed.</p> \n<p>Electric ice globesare a very new addition to the market but are getting some attention regardless. Consumers started searching for them in June 2023, with search interesting starting at 50 monthly\u2014to October 2023.</p> \n<h2>How to choose the perfect ice globe</h2> \n<h3>Prioritize good quality</h3> \n<p>When choosing ice globes, select a pair made from high-quality glass and aluminum. And consumers should be able to chill them in a freezer and not the fridge\u2014which is impossible with low-quality materials.</p> \n<p>More importantly, choosing high-quality materials is necessary to keep allergic reactions or irritations at bay and give consumers\u2019 skin the tender loving care it deserves.</p> \n<h3>Consider antifreeze liquid</h3> \n<p>Here\u2019s a pro tip: go for ice globes with antifreeze liquid\u2014they\u2019re the cream of the crop. Such ice globes are the easiest to use and can maintain their chilly goodness for longer, giving consumers an extra indulgent massage experience.</p> \n<h3>Check the condensation collection</h3> \n<p>Another thing to factor in when choosing ice globe facial massagers is condensation collection. Many ice globe manufacturers cut corners using low-quality glass in the stems, leading to annoying condensation. It\u2019s not a fun experience, especially if consumers want to use ice globes and creams or serums.</p> \n<h3>Consider the size</h3> \n<p>Size is another factor that matters for ice globes. They shouldn\u2019t be too tiny or oversized as that would make them a handful to manage\u2014and consumers won\u2019t get the right pressure they\u2019re after.</p> \n<p>The key to a fantastic facial massage is applying even pressure with smooth rolling movements, and it\u2019s only possible with the right ice globe size. Typically, the best ice globe sizes range from 1.5 to 2.5 inches in diameter for most consumers.</p> \n<p>However, others may choose based on their preference and face size. Consumers with a smaller face will prefer 1.5 or 2-inch diameter ice globes as they\u2019re easy enough to maneuver and won\u2019t feel bulky.</p> \n<p>Conversely, consumers with larger faces will need only 2.5-inch diameter ice globes. They\u2019ll provide enough coverage and be more effective at reducing puffiness and inflammation than smaller ones.</p> \n<h2>What massages can consumers do with ice globes?</h2> \n<h3>Lifting massage</h3> \n<p>Facelift massages are gentle, non-surgical versions of more intense lifting treatments. The idea is to give consumers a few minutes of pure relaxation and, as a bonus, keep their skin looking youthful for the long haul.</p> \n<p>However, an ice globe facelift massage is a consumer\u2019s ticket to revitalizing those tired eyes, smoothing out pesky wrinkles, tightening up sagging spots, and infusing their face with a new lease on life.</p> \n<h3>Lymphatic drainage massage</h3> \n<p>Lymphatic massages, also called lymphatic drainage, have been a cornerstone of Asiaskincaretraditions for ages. In recent years, they\u2019ve stood the test of time and turned into a highly Instagram-worthy #BeautyGoals moment.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s the deal: the massage is like a wake-up call for lymph nodes, helping them flush out toxins and give the consumer\u2019s skin a boost of essential nutrients. When they team it up with ice globes, it\u2019ll dial the skin care glow up to 11, leaving consumers with a radiant complexion.</p> \n<h2>What products should consumers use with ice globes?</h2> \n<p>Ice globe facial massages are a pure delight by themselves. But when consumers toss in their favorite beauty product, it\u2019s a match made in heaven.</p> \n<p>Beyond their direct perks, ice globes help the skin soak up the effects of masks, serums, oils, or creams more effectively. So, teaming them with skincare products is a brilliant move. Oils, in particular, play well with ice globes.</p> \n<p>However, consumers should avoid something super greasy or ultra-absorbent. It should create a silky glide for the ice globes while doing its magic on the user\u2019s skin. Some of the top picks areargan,jojoba, avocado, and sea buckthorn.</p> \n<p>But teaming up the ice globe with abio-cellulose cooling maskis the ultimate move. It combines the super hydrating magic of bio-cellulose with cooling masks\u2019 chill vibes, resulting in an unbeatable spa-like experience.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Ice globes offer a superior facial massage experience with many benefits. They can help smoothen wrinkles, remove puffiness, and revitalize the skin. While there are only two types (traditional and electric) available in the market, they\u2019ve been gaining more attention in recent years.</p> \n<p>Businesses not sure where to start can leverage this guide. It provides everything they need to make profits from ice globes in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Recent developments are working to serve BIPOC consumers within the expansive suncare industry. Barriers like assumptions that darker skin requires less protection and the unwelcome white cast left behind by many products have hindered inclusion. However, small beauty brands are spearheading accessible formulations to meet this demographic\u2019s skincare and suncare needs. Textures cater to specific concerns while ingredients provide additional benefits. Moving forward, further understanding this underserved audience will be key for brands to make lasting change.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Debunking myths about sun protection for darker skin2. Solutions for removing white cast on darker skin3. Combining sun protection and skincare4. Celebrities championing inclusive sun care5. Conclusion</p> \n<h2>Debunking myths about sun protection for darker skin</h2> \n<p>Prevailing myths that darker skin tones require less sun protection continue to prevent inclusion. The assumption stems from the increased protection melanin provides compared to lighter skin. However, the highest possible defense for very dark skin still only equates to SPF 13. Most experts recommend a minimum of SPF 30 daily. Though rare, skin cancer risks also exist. Those with darker skin tones are overall less likely to get skin cancer but four times more likely to receive an advanced-stage melanoma diagnosis.</p> \n<p>Beyond risks, sunlight still causes damage like hyperpigmentation. A common refrain insists skin must visibly burn to necessitate protection. In reality, unseen genetic mutations happen with UV exposure that accumulate over time. Ultimately a lack of visible damage now does not preclude issues down the line. Everyone benefits from daily protection.</p> \n<p>These misconceptions partially result from historical exclusion of darker skin in dermatology research and education. Many professionals admit feeling undertrained to properly treat conditions in melanated skin. Consequently, sun protection is prescribed less often. An increase in diverse voices on social media provides more representation dispelling myths. Beauty brands also share facts on protection needs for all skin tones. Debunking dated assumptions with modern research encourages more consumers to incorporate sun safety.</p> \n<h2>Solutions for removing white cast on darker skin</h2> \n<p>The white residue many sun protection products leave behind deters use, especially in deeper skin tones. Both chemical and mineral formulas can result in visible buildup. In mineral sunscreens, ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide physically deflect UV rays but show up opaque on melanin-rich skin. New innovations balance and disperse these non-nano particles to limit clumping and white cast while retaining efficacy. Chemical filters absorb rays instead, often proving easier to formulate without a cast.</p> \n<p>When minerals or chemicals are unbalanced, light reflects unevenly off skin resulting in white buildup. Advances control dispersion and absorption to transmit light smoothly. Japanese brand Shiseido uses a chemical formula with ingredients like alcohol-free hyaluronic acid for invisibility. Fenty Skin relies on a reef-friendly chemical filter combo for a universal tint. Bliss\u2019s mineral sunscreen incorporates fruit stem cells to create a sheer, vanishing tint.</p> \n<p>Beyond formulas, lightweight skin care-makeup hybrids cater to women seeking protection plus complexion benefits. Multitasking tinted mineral options like Ilia\u2019s serum skin tint even out skin tone with a dewy glow while preventing damage. Education also reduces hesitation using mineral blockers. Assuring skeptics about safety and quality through scientific explanations and clean ingredients helps conversion. Overall product adjustments and improved understanding make SPF more welcoming for excluded demographics.</p> \n<h2>Combining sun protection and skincare</h2> \n<p>Innovations go beyond basic protection to provide skin-loving ingredients that also shield from damage. Formulas tackle concerns like hyperpigmentation through added brightening components. Antioxidant and vitamin-rich additives treat existing uneven tone and discoloration while preventing future dark spots.</p> \n<p>Catering to melanated skin in need of moisture, brands infuse hydrators like glycerin, shea butter and squalane. These moisturizing, soothing emollients defend against dryness and irritation that can increase with sun exposure. Nutrients also strengthen skin\u2019s barrier function protecting from environmental aggressors.</p> \n<p>Expanding beyond facial care, hair and body categories bring UV defense to scalp and locks. Formulas with UVA/UVB filters specify safety for styled textures from straight to coily. Some brands move into color cosmetics with lip glosses, serums and tints incorporating protection. Even make-up removers feature cleansing oils with SPF filters for full oversight.</p> \n<p>This fusion of care and coverage reaches new audiences unaccustomed to daily sun defense. Making protection less clinical and more cosmetic enhances its standing as a non-negotiable step. The skincare association frames proper UVA/UVB safeguards as essential self-care rather than just medical advice. Multitasking products provide value-added skin nutrition on top of damage defense to compel consistent use. Combining care and protection makes SPF more appealing.</p> \n<h2>Celebrities championing inclusive sun care</h2> \n<p>High-profile names advocate for increased sun safety inclusion through new product ventures and open dialogue. After personal experiences struggling to find options suitable for her skin tone, model Winnie Harlow launched a line inspired by her Jamaican heritage and vitiligo condition. Her range filled a noticeable gap with items catering to overlooked concerns like unwanted white casts.</p> \n<p>Other famous faces echo similar motivations of making protection more accessible. Tennis icon Venus Williams\u2019 clean beauty collaboration contains reef-safe mineral filters to open sustainable options. Musician Frank Ocean\u2019s mother, Katonya Breaux, started a brand offering mineral tints reducing the appearance of pores while moisturizing without residue.</p> \n<p>Beyond products, public figures openly discuss the need for improved sun defense education and accessibility. Athlete Naomi Osaka\u2019s brand spotlights the importance of protection across skin tones, keeping prices low to combat lack of access she calls \u201csun poverty.\u201d Osaka uses her platform to share facts on properly caring for melanated skin to challenge assumptions.</p> \n<p>Ultimately celebrity interest draws attention while conveying larger social messages on representation and inclusion. Household names and rising stars alike feel emboldened to speak out on holes they see in the market through new business ventures or candid commentary. Their involvement puts pressure on mainstream brands to expand offerings and helps give consumers permission to seek improved solutions.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The growing understanding of sun protection needs across all skin tones shows promise for increased inclusion. Recent innovations address common barriers facing melanated consumers like white casts and assumption minimization through advanced formulas and improved education. As small brands pave the way with novel hybrid products, larger players must follow suit to remain relevant. Similarly, retailers have opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of overlooked groups to provide specialty options catering to their concerns. Overall the expanding dialogue and novel solutions suggest a more equitable sun care landscape ahead.</p> \n"}]}

This article explores five hot trends businesses should leverage in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWill ear wax removal tools be profitable in 2024?5 ear wax removal tool trends to watch out for in 2024Final words</p> \n<h2>Will ear wax removal tools be profitable in 2024?</h2> \n<p>According toexperts, the global ear wax removal tools market was valued at US $2.0 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% from 2022 to 2030.</p> \n<p>The reason for this growth can be attributed to the rising awareness of the effects of ear wax buildup on health and the increase in consumers\u2019 desire for better personal hygiene.</p> \n<p>Based onregion, Asia-Pacific is recorded to hold one of the largest shares in the ear wax removal market.</p> \n<h2>5 ear wax removal tool trends to watch out for in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Ear drops</h3> \n<p>Ear dropsare a chemical solution for various ear issues, including ear infections, itchiness, ear pain, and ear wax removal. They are generally safe for use, but to avoid complications, the user should obtain instructions on proper use from a licensed medical professional.</p> \n<p>Consumers express interest in ear drops because they are a non-invasive way of ear wax removal. They are also seen as the cheaper and most convenient option depending on the product type required by the consumer.</p> \n<p>Althoughear dropsare easy to self-administer, wrongful application can lead to a high risk of ear infection and, in some cases, damage to the eardrum.</p> \n<p>Based on Google reports, the keyword \u201cear drops\u201d records 135,000 average monthly search queries from consumers. The search term has also maintained a 7\u20139% rise from November 2022 to October 2023.</p> \n<h3>2. Cotton buds</h3> \n<p>Cotton budsare the most easily accessible ear wax removal tool available to consumers.</p> \n<p>They are made of plastic or wood with absorbent cotton fixed to both ends. They also come in various colors, the most popular being white.</p> \n<p>Healthcare practitioners do not recommend cotton buds as a good option for ear wax removal because they only do superficial ear cleaning. It\u2019s worth noting that usingcotton budsmay push more ear wax down the ear canal, resulting in hearing loss, infection, and other issues.</p> \n<p>Despite safety concerns,cotton budsare still considered a home toilet cabinet essential by consumers because of their familiarity with the product and the fact that it is a cheaper option. It is important to note that for consumers concerned about the environment, cotton buds are available in biodegradable materials, which reduce pollution.</p> \n<p>Google Ads data shows that this ear wax removal tool has two high-performing keywords: \u201ccotton swabs\u201d and \u201ccotton buds.\u201d The first one has maintained 49,500 searches since 2022, while the second boosted from its average 40,500 queries to 49,500 in October 2023.</p> \n<h3>3. Ear sprays</h3> \n<p>Ear sprays are similar in purpose to ear drops but differ in their mode of application. They are liquids that come in different kinds: water-based compounds (e.g., isotonic solution, saline solution, or sodium bicarbonate), oil\u2010based compounds (e.g., tea tree oil, mineral oil, or olive oil), non\u2010oil\u2010based solutions (hydrogen peroxide or aloe vera), or a combination of the aforementioned.</p> \n<p>Consumers opt forear spraysbecause they are easier to administer than ear drops and do not require a precise hand-in application. Google Ads data proves they are some of the most popular techniques. From May 2023 to August, ear sprays maintained a steady 27,100 search queries. In September, they surged to 33,100 searches, carrying that number over to October 2023.</p> \n<p>Ear spraysare the perfect solution for ear wax removal and prevention of ear infections. However, the type of ear spray administered to a consumer will differ on a case-by-case basis.</p> \n<p>Ear sprays may not be the best choice for some consumers because of ear sensitivity, possible allergies, and existing ear pain or injuries. Consumers continue to purchaseear spraysbecause they have gentle application on the ears.</p> \n<h3>4. Ear syringing/ear irrigation</h3> \n<p>Ear irrigationis an ear cleansing procedure used to eliminate excessive buildup of earwax. It involves using a syringe to flush out the ear with warm water or a solution. Consumers prioritizing their comfort and convenience see ear irrigation as the best choice.</p> \n<p>The increased use ofear syringingcan be attributed to the world tilting more toward disposable supplies. As a result, reports from Google Ads show that ear syringing receives an impressive 368,000 searches monthly\u2014and it has been that way since 2022.</p> \n<p>Forear irrigationto be accurately administered, a trained medicalprofessionalis required because ear irrigation is a strict procedure that requires precision and tests before the consumer can be treated.</p> \n<p>This, however, has not stopped manufacturers from creating ear irrigation tool kits for consumers to buy at a pharmacy. Despite the concerns of carrying outear irrigationprocedures on oneself, some consumers prefer buying the tool kit because it is a more budget-friendly option than seeking medical assistance.</p> \n<p>For either method a consumer deems fit,ear irrigationshould never be carried out on anyone who has just been through an ear surgery, has a perforated eardrum, or has a history of ear infections and ear trauma.</p> \n<h3>5. Micro suction</h3> \n<p>For consumers with ear sensitivity and a tendency toward ear irritation, micro-suction is a great choice for ear wax removal. Before a doctor commences themicro suctionprocedure, an examination is carried out on the patient\u2019s affected ear.</p> \n<p>First, the doctor uses an otoscope to locate the blockage in the ear. Once this is done, they probe the ear and release the ear wax with themicro suction wand.</p> \n<p>Micro suctionis contested to be the best ear wax removal procedure because it is swift and does not introduce moisture into the ear. Because this procedure does not use water and solutions, there is less risk of irritation, catering to consumers with serious ear sensitivity.</p> \n<p>It is also a great choice because, unlike ear irrigation, it is suitable for consumers with a history of ear trauma or those who have undergone ear surgery. The advantages are many, but all that makes micro suction an expensive choice that cannot possibly cater to all budgets.</p> \n<p>Google Ads data shows that micro-suction ear wax removal averages 8,100 monthly searches. Although it increased to 9,000 searches in September 2023, interest returned to 8,100 the following month.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>There are several ear wax removal methods available on the market. However, the use of each technique depends on the severity of the consumer\u2019s ear wax blockage.</p> \n<p>For serious cases of ear wax build-up, ear irrigation and micro-suction seem to be the best options. Consumers who desire quick relief on a budget can always opt for cotton buds or ear drops.</p> \n<p>Statistics prove that this market is bursting with profit potential, so hop onto these trends to leverage their potential in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

In 2024, synthetic formulations will become a must-have for online retailers. Why? As technology advances, synthetic ingredients often perform better with fewer irritants. We\u2019ll explore the consumer demand fueling the trend and how retailers can capitalize on rising synthetic beauty.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Consumers want results, not just natural labels2. Advanced science delivers effective formulas3. Sustainability starts with smart packaging4. How online retailers can ride the next wave</p> \n<h2>1. Consumers want results, not just natural labels</h2> \n<p>Natural and organic labels just don\u2019t carry the cachet they once did in the beauty world. Today\u2019s consumers have matured, seeking products that actually work instead of just featuring buzzwords. They understand that \u201cnatural\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean safer or more environmentally sound. This growing demand for demonstrable results over natural claims is fueling a surge of interest in synthetically formulated cosmetics and skincare.</p> \n<p>Lab-made ingredients offer something that fickle Mother Nature simply can\u2019t: consistency. Synthesized Beauty has pinpointed the active compounds behind extracts like Vitamin C and retinol, allowing them to formulate these precisely each time. The upshot? Products deliver reliably high-performing results. Clinical-style testing also provides proof customers now demand image-centric natural branding.</p> \n<p>As the realities behind natural products tarnish the halo effect, expect to see synthetic formulations take over shoppers\u2019 carts. The more brands can scientifically demonstrate a product\u2019s benefits, the more consumers will glow over effectively enhanced beauty instead of arbitrarily natural claims. We\u2019ve moved into an era where man-made means making visible improvements.</p> \n<h2>2. Advancedsciencedelivers effective formulas</h2> \n<p>Beyond offering consistency, synthetics also allow for better-targeted solutions. Scientists can craft ingredients addressing specific issues in ways no natural extract ever could.</p> \n<p>Take customized peptides for example. These short protein chains provide a hydration punch strengthening skin moisture barriers, and combatting environmental stressors. Synthesized peptide complexes outperform the most luxurious moisturizing creams from big-name natural brands. Brands like OliOla use biotechnology to engineer moisture-binding peptides for boosting hydration up to 70% within four weeks.</p> \n<p>Or consider next-gen retinoids playing whack-a-mole with wrinkles. Natural retinol alternatives often irritate and degrade when exposed to air and sunlight. Enter synthetic retinoids \u2013 stabilized, slowly-released versions that sidestep irritation while smoothly diffusing into the skin over 8 hours. Early lab trials show these sophisticated retinoids erase wrinkles up to 45% better than leading over-the-counter treatments.</p> \n<p>Expect biotech and green chemistry to unlock more targeted synthetic actives for easily-adopted beauty upgrades. Science is helping consumers get noticeable aesthetic upgrades \u2013 not just fuzzy feel-good marketing. As technology unlocks ingredient innovations, synthetics will eclipse natural.</p> \n<h2>3. Sustainabilitystartswith smart packaging</h2> \n<p>Of course, the sustainability of these lab-made formulations remains top of mind. Consumers want demonstrably greener solutions. Thankfully, synthetic ingredients often support cleaner supply chains and conservation efforts.</p> \n<p>Take squalane for example. This moisturizing wonder has traditionally come from shark liver oil. However, biotech breakthroughs allow for brewing pure olive-derived squalane from start to finish in industrial fermentation vats. No sharks were harmed! Bio-based synthesization makes renewable ingredients scalable without ravaging fragile ecosystems.</p> \n<p>Streamlined production also enables better recycling initiatives further reducing waste. Single-source ingredients skip energy-intensive harvesting, extraction, and transportation involved with far-flung natural supplies. Shorter value chains preserve more resources while upholding green standards.</p> \n<p>Brands keen on sustainability credentials are rethinking packaging too. Bulbous bottles overflowing with air take up precious cargo space and pile upon our environmental shame. Smart brands optimize packaging maintaining efficacy without overdoing on appearances. For example, TrueMission\u2019s chic concentrated serum pods reduce packaging by up to 97% for bringing active ingredients home sans waste. Adaptive cartons then return the recyclable empties back to TrueMission closing the loop.</p> \n<p>As consumers scrutinize entire product lifecycles, synthetic ingredients, and innovative delivery formats show greener routes to beauty. Once deemed clinical and cold, synthetics now bloom as thoughtfully crafted sustainable options. Naturalness becomes secondary to doing less harm.</p> \n<h2>4. How onlineretailerscan ride the next wave</h2> \n<p>Forward-looking online retailers have an opportunity to capture rising consumer demand for demonstrably effective and sustainable synthetic beauty. As natural formulations decline in desirability, proactive product selection and messaging will be key.</p> \n<p>Carefully evaluate new brands prioritizing lab-made ingredients with proven clinical results. Seek out novel textures and clinically tested claims backing visible beautifying effects \u2013 not just subjective sensory feels. Partner with emerging biotech developers crafting green chemistries targeting specific skin needs from acne to hyperpigmentation.</p> \n<p>Conduct trials to document the performance of these synthetic solutions on actual customers. Release video testimonials or before and after imagery putting results on display. Quantify improvements around wrinkle reduction, brightness, firmness, or hydration compared to previous natural options.</p> \n<p>Adapt branding and packaging to call out synthetic ingredients and process benefits. Add sustainability seals affirming production ethics and green commitments. Feature labels like \u201cbio-based\u201d and \u201cocean-friendly\u201d guide consumers to greener choices.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, update your value proposition around what matters now \u2013 better beauty through better science and ethics. With the right curation and messaging, online retailers can ride the coming wave of synthetic formulations for more beautiful and sustainable profits. Reap the rewards as ingredients grown in labs harvest consumer delight in 2024.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Consumer priorities are drifting away from vague natural claims and toward proven results and sustainability. Synthetic beauty formulations offer the next wave of opportunity for online retailers catering to these changing preferences. By delivering the enhancements and ethics consumers now demand, synthetic cement status as the must-have ingredient for 2024. To ride the rising synthetic wave, retailers should start adapting their product mixes and messaging and seeking out brands focused on biotech and highly effective synthetics over natural extracts.\u00a0 Ride the wave of synthetic skincare all the way to more beautiful profits. The next era of efficacy is now.</p> \n"}]}

Once viewed as basic soap bars for the natural crowd, solid skincare has shed its hippie reputation thanks to high-tech innovations in formulations and packaging. Skin-quenching serums infused with coveted ingredients, ergonomic in-shower scrubbers, and chic sustainable cases are just a glimpse of what\u2019s to propel these water saving wonders into the mainstream. With superior solids addressing demands for quality, performance and responsible consumption, they present an ever-more appealing option to eco-invested shoppers who don\u2019t want to compromise on self-care. 2024 may prove a breakout year for clever waterless concepts that tend to skin and sustainability with equal dexterity.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Solid skincare gets a glow-up2. Shake up your shower routine3. Lighter footprints: BYOW beauty4. Pretty & protective: Packaging gets an upgrade5. Final words</p> \n<h2>Solid skincare gets a glow-up</h2> \n<p>Skincare solids are seeing a renaissance thanks to sophisticated formulations that mimic the most sought-after liquids. Serums and creams once reserved for droppers and pumps now arrive in hands-free bars and balms brimming with the same coveted ingredients that graced their water-based counterparts.</p> \n<p>Seeking to convert even ingredient-scrutinizing skintellectuals, brands infuse antioxidant and collagen-stimulating vitamin C, smoothing alpha hydroxy acids, and plumping hyaluronic acid into solid creations. Others opt for encapsulated retinoids time-released upon application for a gentler yet still potent anti-aging effect. Even broad spectrum mineral SPF, the final frontier for finicky chemical-averse consumers, makes an appearance in solid form from attentive organic labels.</p> \n<p>Rather than relying solely on plant oils, butters and waxes for skin enhancement, many newcomers take care to clinically validate the same performance as leading liquids in their base formulas. Some supplement with smaller discovery sets boasting their hero offerings to allow trial before committed adoption. Others set up consumer testing groups and publish rave reviews to further underscore comparable, if not better, outcomes.</p> \n<p>The message is clear: solid need not mean subpar. As innovation permits ever more sophisticated recipes highly attuned to efficacy, expect the gap between solids and liquids to narrow dramatically by 2024. Skintellectuals in search of results no longer need to choose between their skin and sea when selecting the most suitable products.</p> \n<h2>Shake up your shower routine</h2> \n<p>Shower staples like shampoo and body wash also receive an elevated solid makeover beyond basic soap bars. Seeking to upgrade the entire routine, brands experiment with novel textures, custom molds, and unexpected lathers previously missing in primarily plant-based personal care.</p> \n<p>Rethinking the conventional bar shape, some offer easy-grip ovals or ergonomic hexagons that contour to palm and fingers for frictionless use. Others imprint or emboss finger ridges into the solid exterior to facilitate handling. Still more house small swiveling balls or pebbled surfaces within plastic-free packaging to allow a singular use per bath or shower without cross-contamination.</p> \n<p>Durable shower caddies crafted from recycled stainless steel, biodegradable cellulose, or fast-growing bamboo permit hanging multiple solid toiletries in one convenient spot. Some brands include these strides in organization and storage free alongside product purchases to ease adoption.</p> \n<p>Further upgrades come in the form of custom molds that add back the foaming action shoppers expect from sudsy liquids. Opting for natural soap noodles or moisture-attracting sugars, solid hair and body washes lather generously once activated by water and friction. The resulting foam consistency mirrors gel and bottled cleansers, thereby checking another box for consumers weighing the switch.</p> \n<p>Along with skin-coddling surfactants and gentle preservatives, the additional TLC solid brands invest into overall experience and continues pulling these offerings into modern bathing routines. More than mere utility, tomorrow\u2019s waterless options may become ones that consumers actively prefer.</p> \n<h2>Lighter footprints: BYOW beauty</h2> \n<p>For consumers seeking a gentle foray into waterless beauty, bring-your-own-water (BYOW) offerings provide a familiar path. Powders, tablets, and concentrate drops activate with H2O at home for liquefied cleansers and creams, reducing shipping emissions and plastic waste compared to ready-to-use options.</p> \n<p>Swedish brand Forgo leads the way with a refillable glass bottle bundled alongside a sachet of dry powder cleanser. Adding water generates a gentle foaming wash, while the streamlined packaging cuts back on transport footprint. Eco-conscious Singaporean label Mono Skincare houses its range of body and skincare in tablet form, asking consumers to dissolve one hyper-concentrated disc per month\u2019s use.</p> \n<p>The concentrated angle also allows for precision dispersion, permitting users to customize product quantity and longevity. Lebanese natural brand Beesline features a deodorizing roll-on with vegan salts that transforms into liquid with a quick splash. Even oral care gets updated with plastic-free toothpaste bits and mouthwash tablets from a prominent UK name that shoppers activate themselves.</p> \n<p>Mindful of excess packaging, BYOW brands rely on recyclable aluminum, glass, and paper whenever possible. Some supplement with plant-based meshes or compostable sachets that protect each water-attracting dose. Single serve items take care to biodegrade quickly and safely once their duty is done.</p> \n<p>Blending both familiar rituals with lighter footprints, BYOW offers a transitional step for the sustainably curious. The emphasis on refillability and reducing waste likewise appeals to seasoned eco warriors seeking ever-gentler options.</p> \n<h2>Pretty & protective: Packaging gets an upgrade</h2> \n<p>While solids succeed in sustainability, their fragile nature poses packaging challenges from production to purchase. Seeking solutions that align with eco values while keeping products protected, brands place particular emphasis on recyclable, reusable and refillable housing.</p> \n<p>Eschewing plastics, many compostable paper cartons and boxes now arrive marked with soil degradation timelines, from as little as 45 days. Durable tins crafted from recycled aluminum also make repeat appearances for their endlessly renewable potential once reclaimed. Still others innovate natural structural materials from fast-growing bamboo stalks or biodegradable algae composites resistant to mold.</p> \n<p>Clever multitasking options see fragrance brands combine two favorite scents within one travel-ready mirrored compact, permitting custom blends on the go. Streamlining further, French suppliers pioneer reloadable lip and cheek sticks designed expressly to permit easy recycling and reduce waste.</p> \n<p>Attentive to end use, effective storage remedies bring these winners home. Recycled stainless steel racks allow multiple solid bars to hang freely, drying between uses. Olympic swimmer-founded Hungarian company Zenescence offers a teak shower caddy with raised ridges to promote airflow along with five adjustable ledges for stacking different toiletries.</p> \n<p>While early unwrapped soap bars certainly saved on packaging, today\u2019s elevated solid options understand the importance of first impressions paired with responsible protection. Marrying good looks with practical safeguarding, they transmit their intended excellence before even revealing enhanced formulas within.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Rather than a passing fad, solid beauty has cemented itself as a permanent player thanks to intelligent innovation. From results-driven formulas that pamper skin to refreshing foams that invigorate the senses, waterless options now compete toe-to-toe with liquids when it comes to self-care. Paired with protective packaging that treads gently on the planet, these concentrated compacts offer care and conscience in one. 2024 sees savvy shoppers appreciating solids that work as hard for the environment as they do to nourish bodies. Sustainable beauty has undoubtedly entered its most sophisticated era to date.</p> \n"}]}

Even better is that many eye creams contain ingredients like retinol, peptides, or hyaluronic acid, helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</p> \n<p>Eye creams also contain vitamin C, kojic acid, and caffeine to help brighten under-eye areas and reduce puffiness/inflammation. More importantly,eye creamsalso offer moisturizing benefits to water down the terrible effects of dry skin around the eyes. Hence, it\u2019s no surprise why more consumers are gleaning towards the eye cream.</p> \n<h3>Eye serum</h3> \n<p>Eye serumsgenerate much buzz around buying consumers as they rake in 27,100 searches monthly (according to Google data). Like eye creams, these concentrated formulations can handle delicate and sensitive skin around the eyes, providing solutions for fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles, and other issues.</p> \n<p>However, some consumers prefereye serumsto creams because of the different consistency. Serums offer a lightweight and thinner consistency as manufacturers craft them from smaller molecules.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all.

In truth, most eye essences focus on hydrating delicate areas, allowing consumers to maintain and boost skin moisture.</p> \n<h3>Under-eye mask</h3> \n<p>Under-eye masks(or eye patches) are eye care products with unique properties. They offer the best solution for under-eye areas, making them more specialized than serums, creams, and essences.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers makeeye masksfrom gel, hydrogel, cloth, or other materials saturated with serums or other active ingredients. Even better is that the gel or hydrogel variants offer cooling and soothing sensations to help refresh the under-eye area.</p> \n<p>Eye patchesalso top the list as one of the most popular eye care products in 2023 (and it seems they\u2019ll remain that way in 2024). Reports from Google Ads reveal they dominate the market with over 201,000 searches monthly.</p> \n<h3>Hydrating eye gel</h3> \n<p>Hydrating eye gelrefreshes tired, screen-stressed eyes. It has a cooling formulation that uses ingredients like antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid to deal with consumers that face puffiness and dark patches under their eyes.</p> \n<p>Even better is thathydrating eye gelsare the go-to products for a noticeable and instant hit of refreshment. They come packed with skin-loving ingredients like collagen, niacinamide, and retinol to attack puffiness, wrinkles, dark circles, and fine lines.</p> \n<p>Eye gelsare raking in impressive numbers in 2023, showing they\u2019ll get even better by 2024. Search interest for this product increased from 12100 in October to 148000 in November 2023.</p> \n<h2>Focus on these trends</h2> \n<p>The landscape of eye care products is evolving, presenting exciting opportunities for retailers to leverage in 2024. Eye creams help moisturize the sensitive area around the eyes, while eye serums appeal to consumers who prefer a thinner consistency.</p> \n<p>Eye essences offer a watery-like alternative to creams and serums, but hydrating eye gels are the go-to for instant refreshment. Lastly, consumers looking to target their under-eye areas will love eye masks.</p> \n<p>Dive into these trends to offer an updated eye beauty inventory in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Final takeaways</p> \n<h2>The rise of multi-step bridal beauty routines</h2> \n<p>Bridal beauty preparations are becoming more extensive and starting earlier than ever before. With the average engagement length increasing, many brides begin planning their skincare and makeup routines 6-12 months prior to their wedding day. They want to allow adequate time to commit to treatments and products that will help them look their best when they walk down the aisle.</p> \n<p>According to recent surveys, today\u2019s brides are especially focused on achieving a natural, effortless glow with clear and radiant skin. To accomplish this, they are investing in clinical skincare ingredients and procedures like microdermabrasion and laser facials. These are often followed by recovery-focused products to soothe skin and minimize redness or irritation.</p> \n<p>Brands have an opportunity to curate multi-step skincare and makeup regimens specifically tailored for the bridal market. For example, a 6-month bridal skincare routine could include clarifying and brightening cleansers and serums for the first few months, followed by plumping and firming products closer to the wedding date. Pairing these with coordinating makeup palettes and lip colors allows for a cohesive, pull-together bride look.</p> \n<p>Kits containing a complete routine are attractive as all-in-one solutions for stressed brides. And enhancing the packaging and marketing to align with the wedding theme makes them suitable for showers and proposal gift giving as well. Tapping into this growing bridal demand by positioning products for wedding prep presents a lucrative possibility for beauty brands.</p> \n<h2>Curating gift sets for wedding parties</h2> \n<p>In addition to the bride herself, bridal parties and wedding guests are also interested in looking their best for the special day. This creates an opportunity for specially curated skin, makeup, and personal care sets that are positioned as the perfect wedding party gifts.</p> \n<p>Attendants often appreciate pampering presents that help them relax and unwind during the traditionally chaotic lead-up to their friend\u2019s big day. So gift sets with a focus on self-care, like scented candles, bath soaks, and facial masks are likely to appeal.</p> \n<p>When it comes to makeup, complementary collections that align with the bride\u2019s own wedding beauty look make for thoughtful gifts. For a romantic, rosy-hued bridal style, include corresponding pink-toned lip glosses, blushes, and eye palettes for the maidens. Tailor shades to a variety of skin tones for the most versatility within the group.</p> \n<p>And don\u2019t forget the men! From the groom to the groomsmen, male wedding gift sets are a relatively untapped market. Kits containing skin-refining facial washes, smoothing shave creams, and hydrating sun protection products instantly upgrade prep for any style wedding.</p> \n<p>No matter the recipient, themed packaging and customization options give wedding beauty gifts a special bespoke feel. Offer engraving, individualized labels, trendy bridal wraps, or clever wordplay names on the sets to capture sales around weddings.</p> \n<h2>Personalized and scented products for the betrothed</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s couples want to infuse their personalities, backgrounds, and even their love stories into their weddings for a meaningful, custom affair. This provides openings for bespoke beauty products just for the bride and groom that hold sentimental value for their special day.</p> \n<p>Customizable fragrances have become quite popular, with workshops allowing couples to create signature scents for their weddings. The personalized process fosters intimacy between the pair while producing unique perfumes and colognes. These can then be gifted to members of the wedding party as meaningful keepsakes.</p> \n<p>Some services even capture the scent of a couple\u2019s venue flowers, bouquet, or favorite romantic meal into one-of-a-kind perfume. Wearing these fragrances after the wedding evokes nostalgic memories for years to come.</p> \n<p>In addition to fragrance, customized vitamin C serums, facial mists, and lip glosses allow couples to develop formulations specifically for their skin needs and makeup looks. Opting for decorative packaging featuring their names, wedding date, or custom logo elevates the bespoke factor even further.</p> \n<p>Proposal boxes and bridal beauty countdown calendars also present fun opportunities for personalization while building anticipation. Showcasing images of each partner alongside coordinated lip and cheek shades makes for playful gifts for the betrothed during wedding prep season.</p> \n<h2>Marvelous approaches for Wedding Prep Season</h2> \n<p>With growing consumer interest in extended wedding preparation, a strategic marketing approach is key to maximizing related beauty sales. The wedding prep timeframe typically ramps up 6-12 months prior to peak summer and early fall wedding dates.</p> \n<p>Leading up to this season, limited edition sets, unique messaging, influencer partnerships, and social campaigns help position your brand as a go-to for bridal beauty solutions. Emails and blog content educating soon-to-be brides on achieving a flawless bridal glow can nurture leads during the long prep phase.</p> \n<p>Unique bridal beauty imagery and copy on website landing pages and product listings also helps grab attention. Consider catchy niche hashtags to tap into social buzz and search around wedding skincare or makeup looks.</p> \n<p>In terms of promotions, compel brides-to-be to lock in multi-step regimens with enticing discounts on full routine purchases. Free customization on certain products also adds value during the wedding lead-up.</p> \n<p>Post-wedding, continue nurturing relationships with thoughtful, personalized email outreach. Provide guidance on transitioning her skincare regimen as needed, along with exclusive savings toward replenishing favorites. Building lasting connections leads to long-term loyalty beyond her special day.</p> \n<h2>Final takeaways</h2> \n<p>With weddings coming back in full force, the months-long preparation process presents tremendous openings for tailored beauty offerings.

Back then, cinnamon and peppers were used to achieve full lips. With the advancement of technology, lip-plumper tools incorporate ingredients like peptides andhydrochloric acidto plump up lips.</p> \n<p>Lip plumper tools are sought after by many consumers because they are a non-invasive way of getting full lips at a lesser cost. Although the results from the extracts in a product may be temporary, they help increase blood flow in the lips to attain the much-desired full lip effect.</p> \n<h2>What are the benefits of lip plumper tools?</h2> \n<h3>No injections</h3> \n<p>Lip plumper tools are ranked high in beauty supply must-haves because they offer consumers plump lips without discomfort or invasive procedures.</p> \n<p>With lip plumper tools, there is no need to worry about injections or await results after a long period. Lip plumper tools provide an instant solution without medical aid.</p> \n<h3>Enhanced hydration</h3> \n<p>Dry lips do more than just affect physical appearance. They are a source of discomfort and leave the lips prone to bacterial infections, affecting overall health. But lip plumpers solve this issue easily with hydrating ingredients.</p> \n<p>Lip plumper tools help upgrade the lip\u2019s moisture retention, preventing annoying cracks. And hydration in lip plumpers also protects the lips from harsh weather conditions.</p> \n<h3>Long-lasting, natural results</h3> \n<p>Consumers want to enhance their lip appearance without a dramatic transformation, and lip plumpers offer the best solution. They subtly improve lip appearance, giving a natural result that does not appear exaggerated.</p> \n<p>Lip plumper tools provide consumers with a kind of luxury lip augmentation can\u2019t. Their flexibility makes up for the temporary results, allowing ladies to enjoy a plump lip without the commitments.</p> \n<h2>What to look for in lip plumper tools?</h2> \n<h3>Plumping effect</h3> \n<p>Lip plumpers are sought after because of their principal function: lip plumping! However, the sort of lip plumper tool used impacts the effect on the lips.</p> \n<p>Some customers desire subtle effects, while others prefer noticeable changes\u2014with some wanting something balanced. Lip plumper tools accommodate these individualized preferences, allowing customers to attain the desired appearance easily and affordably.</p> \n<p>As a reminder, no consumer wants to appear outlandish; the lip plumper tools must always provide a natural result regardless of the appearance they are aiming for.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>Lip plumper tools don\u2019t work like magic; they contain specific ingredients that stimulate the lips to achieve a plump appearance. The ingredients can be classified into two: irritants and hydrating agents.</p> \n<p>Irritants are medically designed to stimulate the lips. Common irritants found in lip plumper tools include peppers, menthol, and capsicum. Lip plumpers that rely on these irritants must have moisture retention capabilities to avoid adverse effects on the user.</p> \n<p>Lip plumper tools that use hydrating ingredients like hydrochloric acid, eliminate the burning sensation caused by irritants. Then, they increase the moisture in the lips, helping to achieve a plump lip effect.</p> \n<p>For consumers with allergies, the safe choice would be hydrating lip plumper tools. This is because irritants not only cause a burning sensation, but users with allergies may face risk through its use.</p> \n<h3>Color</h3> \n<p>Lip colorchange is often a result of some lip plumper tools. It\u2019s usually nothing drastic as their ingredients (pepper extracts or cinnamon) can briefly stimulate blood flow to the lips, creating a faint reddening effect.</p> \n<p>Although consumers sometimes love this effect, they won\u2019t appreciate it if it looks unnatural or shows shades of irritation. Hence, businesses must look for lip plumpers without ingredients that could cause such effects.</p> \n<h2>3 different types of lip plumpers worth investing in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Lip gloss or balms</h3> \n<p>Consumers value convenience, and there is no easier way to get a pouty or fuller lip than with lip balms and/ lip gloss. Lip balms andlip glossonly require a swipe across the lips to give an instant full lip appearance.</p> \n<p>Withboth optionsavailable on the market, consumers need not be concerned about the highly invasive treatment lip surgery offers.</p> \n<p>The table below outlines the advantages and disadvantages of using lip balms and lip gloss as a lip plumper tool.</p> \n<p>Based on Google reports, the keywords \u201clip gloss\u201d and \u201clip balm\u201d record 673,000 and 550,000 average monthly search queries from buying consumers, respectively. Both search terms have also maintained the numbers since August 2023.</p> \n<h3>2. Suction lip plumpers</h3> \n<p>Suction lip plumpersuse a vacuum mechanism to achieve a full lip appearance. And customers can choose between two types of suction lip plumpers.</p> \n<p>First is themanual suction lipplumper. The manual suction lip plumper is typically made of rubber with an open mouthpiece. Its design allows consumers to achieve their desired effect with only a few pumps.</p> \n<p>Second is theelectrical suction lipplumper. Unlike the manual variant, consumers can automate the process with a simple click, allowing the tool to simulate blood flow and create plumper lips.</p> \n<p>The manual andelectrical suction lipplumpers offer the user control. With the manual one, users can press as long as they wish to determine their lip plumpness, while the mechanical ones often come with timers offering the same level of control.</p> \n<p>No matter the choice, it is important to note that the excessive use of suction lip plumpers can result in bruising, swelling, misalignment of the teeth, and, in extreme cases, tooth loss.</p> \n<h3>3. Lip masks</h3> \n<p>Lip masksare popular, and it comes as no surprise given that lip masks are an ideal choice due to their moisturizing effect. Based on reports from Google Ads, they average 201,000 monthly searches. Search interest increased by 10% from 165,000 in May 2023 to the average value in October 2023.</p> \n<p>Lip masksare available in creams and sheets, each boasting a blend of hydrating ingredients such as hydrochloric acid, beeswax, and vitamin extracts (depending on the product). Consumers must place them on their lips for a specific period and will get anatural plumpappearance after removing them.</p> \n<h2>Rounding up</h2> \n<p>Lip plumper tools are considered the ultimate beauty box essential because they offer a non-invasive, low-risk way of achieving natural plump lips. However, purchasing them is not as simple as ordering them in bulk.</p> \n<p>Businesses must consider plump effect, color, and ingredients before offering lip plumping tools in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

Fueled by sophisticated routines and concerns like pollution and mask-wearing, the C-derm category balloons 29% annually, reaching over $8 billion by 2023 per projections. Beyond clinical solutions for urban skin woes, Chinese consumers want the fun factor, leading brands to embed Internet culture and memes into engaging product stories. The market also expands into anti-aging as beauty ideals shift. Brands able to balance scientific formulations with Gen Z-friendly spins are poised to seize opportunities.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Scientific substance over style2. Precision beauty formulas3. Clinical goes playful4. Broadening anti-aging appeal5. Final words</p> \n<h2>Scientific substance over style</h2> \n<p>Chinese skinvestors increasingly prize actual performance over buzzy ingredients when assessing C-derm products. Call it the rise of the evidence geeks. These amateur scientists want to see formulas backed by measurable results, clinical trials, and hard data instead of following fleeting trends.</p> \n<p>Brands respond with actives targeted to skin needs and concerns. Sensitive skincare brand WINONA draws on traditional Chinese medicine, using herbs like physalis calyx and paeonia root bark with published research demonstrating efficacy for aging and sensitive skin. Other brands tap bioengineered ingredients for better bioavailability and sustainability. Human-like collagen brand Collgene claims its lab-created collagen outperforms other sources in compatibility and abundance.</p> \n<p>Ingredient scarcity also propels the shift from natural to nature-identical and sci-tech alternatives. Sourcing rare botanicals strains supply chains while potentially damaging fragile ecosystems. Educating consumers on sustainable, lab-crafted ingredients can overcome perceptions. For its Soothing Cleansing Balm, TIMAGE keeps its formula to 16 ingredients or less, all proven gentle, effective, and allergen-free.</p> \n<p>While exciting novel ingredients grab attention, Chinese skinvestors ultimately care about overall performance. Transparency on sourcing, scientific backing, and environmental impact is now vital. Formulas showcase hero ingredients but shouldn\u2019t overwhelm with superfluous actives that dilute results.</p> \n<h2>Precision beauty formulas</h2> \n<p>Beauty brands can no longer treat Chinese skinvestors as passive consumers, but must engage them as scientific collaborators. These devotees dig into the calculations and lab methodologies behind their cosmetic products. Key trends include multi-phase delivery systems, active ingredient micro-encapsulation, and mimicking natural skin structures.</p> \n<p>Luxe skincare brand PMPM uses a patented four-to-one water-to-oil ratio in its hero serums to reflect skin\u2019s natural water and fat composition. The textures enable deeper penetration paired with time-release of water-wrapped microbeads containing key ingredients. Over in color cosmetics, foundations and concealers spotlight high-performance applicators and builds. JudyDoll\u2019s cloud-touch cream foundation employs an ultra-fine 0.2 micron powder for a seamless, second-skin finish.</p> \n<p>Applications like augmented reality and skin diagnostics are also leveling up. Joocyee developed its inclusive foundation and face palette shades via an AI facial scanner and Chinese skin tone database. Such rigor resonates with skinvestors who take a near forensic interest in product development.</p> \n<p>While clinical precision is expected, aesthetics still matter in beauty. Packaging and textures should align to formulas, enabling precise routines. See how pipette droppers, airless pumps, and twist-click pens figure prominently in new product launches. Ingredient stories andwomen further to life.</p> \n<h2>Clinical goes playful</h2> \n<p>While Chinese skinvestors dig into the science, fun should still anchor every formula. Beauty brands increasingly fuse clinical precision with playful spins to win over Gen Zers and in-betweeners. Product philosophies embed Internet culture, memes, and interactive experiences without sacrificing results.</p> \n<p>See how Aprumu supplements its sensitive skin formulas with neon packaging and cute cartoon mascots. The brand presents complex topics like inflammation triggers in comics-inspired graphics, avoiding jargon. Over at Peterson\u2019s Lab, its Anti-Wrinkle Lip Cream collaborates with internet meme star Pepe the Frog, right down to collectible themed bottle caps. Users can even join Pepe on a digital adventure game while learning about the product.</p> \n<p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al China gets in on virtual idols through mascot Mr. Ou, a handsome French-Chinese avatar presenting ingredient spotlights and skincare advice. His videos draw in millions of followers on social media, helping establish the brand as an approachable authority for Gen Z.</p> \n<p>Brands blend ingredients science with lifestyle and cultural issues close to younger Chinese consumers. Those overlooking fun elements risk being seen as outdated or irrelevant. The sweet spot? Leverage memes and virtual characters while speaking genuinely to modern concerns like sleep health, screen time exposure, and self-esteem. Treat youthful audiences like the beauty experts many aspire to become.</p> \n<h2>Broadening anti-aging appeal</h2> \n<p>Skinvestors increasingly see beauty as skin deep, demanding anti-aging formulas that smooth and plump beyond facial features. From lips and hands to hair and body contours, Chinese consumers scrutinize signs of aging across different touchpoints.</p> \n<p>Eye creams remain a staple, but targeted serums now address areas like the neck, d\u00e9colletage, and nasolabial folds. SimplyThis offers an eye and lip contour cream to specifically minimize wrinkles and lines around the eyes, lips, and smile lines where aging first appears. We also see more products tailored to modern lifestyle factors and beauty bugbears.</p> \n<p>Late night screen exposure is the impetus behind MONSTERCODE\u2019s Midnight Oil serum powered by patented ingredient Synchrolife. The brand touts resetting skin\u2019s circadian rhythms and reversing premature aging inflicted by blue light devices. Over on Douyin, hashtags celebrate slender, delicate \u201cmanga hands\u201d as the emerging ideal \u2014 driving demand for youth-preserving creams and spot treatments.</p> \n<p>While facial care garners lots of play, body care sales surge on Tmall. Body lotions now multitask as anti-agers and barrier helpers. Hair loss treatments likewise gain traction as consumers worry over aging locks. Brands able to sync skin science with modern lifestyle realities and influencer-driven beauty standards can carve out loyal audiences spanning generations.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The C-derm boom reshapes China\u2019s beauty landscape with skinvestors who dig into the science and Gen Zers hooked on function with fun. Online retailers must lead with meticulously formulated hero ingredients in transparent formulas while embedding social currency through meme marketing. Extend into adjacencies like scalp care and body creams riding anti-aging and skin barrier trends. The Middle Kingdom offers outsized rewards for those who get the next-gen mix right. We hope this high-level overview sparks creative ideas to crack the code on China\u2019s explosive C-derm category.</p> \n"}]}

A recent report predicts the global tattoo aftercare market will reach nearly $4 billion by 2030. While most current offerings target tattoo artists, there is a whitespace opportunity around accessible at-home maintenance items. As the number of tattoos continues to grow, skintelligent consumers want solutions that preserve artistic investments. Formulations that leverage cosmetic and skin health claims show particular promise in this emerging category. In just a few sentences, this introduction establishes the rising demand, gaps in the market, and opportunities for beauty brands.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Consumers craving targeted tattoo care solutions2. Healing heroes: Tattoo aftercare essentials3. Preserve the ink: Maintenance must-haves4. 4 ways brands can capture this category5. Final words</p> \n<h2>Consumers craving targeted tattoo care solutions</h2> \n<p>As tattoos shift further into the mainstream, everyday consumers are seeking out products specifically formulated to care for their ink. Key factors driving this demand include changing generational attitudes, social media, and a focus on longevity and protection.</p> \n<p>Tattoos have transitioned from taboo to trendy, especially among Millennials and Gen Z. A 2020 Harris poll found that over 50% of Millennials have at least one tattoo. With negative stereotypes fading, more consumers view tattoos as a form of self-expression. Social media has played a major role, allowing tattoo artists to rapidly grow massive followings. Fans eagerly book appointments with celebrity artists like Doctor Woo who boast over 1.7 million Instagram followers.</p> \n<p>While inspiration thrives online, longevity remains top of mind offline. Consumers understand that sun exposure, friction, and aging can cause tattoos to fade or blur over time. As a result, they want products that preserve and protect their meaningful (and often costly) ink. Targeted skin care that maintains vibrancy is in high demand.</p> \n<p>In sum, society\u2019s shifting attitude toward tattoos combines with social media and preservation concerns to drive consumer interest in specialized care. As more brands enter this blossoming category, portfolio diversification and product personalization will be key differentiation strategies. Formulations catered to inked skin present an exciting innovation avenue.</p> \n<h2>Healing heroes: Tattoo aftercare essentials</h2> \n<p>The initial post-tattoo phase focuses on healing and protection against infection as the skin repairs itself. Consumers want gentle yet effective formulations that aid the healing process at home.</p> \n<p>Cleansing is critical to avoid bacteria that can complicate healing. Antibacterial soaps gently wash away plasma, blood, and excess ink. Next, moisturizing balms create a protective barrier while delivering skin-soothing ingredients like vitamin E, aloe vera, and plant oils. These balms not only hydrate fresh tattoos but also alleviate inflammation and itching.</p> \n<p>Since portability is key, brands offer travel-friendly formats to apply balms on the go. L:A Bruket\u2019s After Care balm comes in a recyclable aluminum tube, while Mad Rabbit\u2019s balm stick allows mess-free application. Consumers also want products that easily integrate into existing routines. Tattoo body washes promote healing through gentle cleansing and hydration.</p> \n<p>Overall, aftercare essentials aid the vulnerable healing stage via antibacterial cleansing paired with protective hydration. Portable formats and everyday body care items promote routine integration. As more consumers embark on tattoo journeys, caring for fresh ink themselves with dedicated products will continue rising in popularity.</p> \n<h2>Preserve the ink: Maintenance must-haves</h2> \n<p>Once healed, the priority shifts to ongoing maintenance to preserve tattoo integrity and vibrancy. Consumers want products that protect from fading while making tattoos look freshly inked.</p> \n<p>Exposure to sun, pollution, and friction gradually extract pigment from skin over time. Specialized formulas counteract these effects with brightening agents and antioxidants. Daily moisturizers hydrate while enhancing vibrancy, whereas serums packed with AHAs gently resurface dull-looking ink. Targeted SPF protection creates a mineral barrier against UV tattoo damage.</p> \n<p>Brands also leverage the familiar lexicon of skin care to promote routine integration. For example, Stories & Ink structures tattoo maintenance across day and night products. Their Brightening Exfoliator aligns with existing regimens as a weekly treatment step. Simplicity helps products seamlessly fit within current rituals.</p> \n<p>Overall, maintenance items allow consumers to safeguard tattoo integrity for the long haul. Leveraging familiar skin care terminology and formulations enables accessibility while underscoring how maintenance helps honor tattoo artistry. As ink continues rising in popularity, caring for it beyond the initial heal will attract consumer investment.</p> \n<h2>4 ways brands can capture this category</h2> \n<p>With this fledgling category demonstrating strong growth potential, how should brands look to capture this opportunity? Here are 4 key strategic plays:</p> \n<p>Spotlight diversity and inclusion.Ink expressing cultural traditions remains prevalent globally. Ensure products suitably cater to needs across skin tones and types. Conduct specialized clinical testing on requirements such as minimizing keloids.</p> \n<p>Co-create with artists.Collaborations, especially with influential tattooers boasting devoted followings, can really bolster credibility. Such partners lend their expertise around formulation and messaging. Their stamp of approval resonates loudly with loyal clientele.</p> \n<p>Travel-ready formats.Portability reigns supreme within aftercare. Single use packets, rollerballs, and pens promote on-the-go application after new ink or before sun exposure. The ease of tossing products into carry-ons appeals greatly.</p> \n<p>Embedded ritual integration.Maintaining tattoos should intertwine seamlessly into daily routines, not create additional steps. Consider how current product formats like body washes could absorb care ingredients. Promote adoption through familiar self-care rituals.</p> \n<p>These four strategies provide diverse innovation springboards to explore within the blossoming tattoo aftercare space. Which approach most aligns with your brand identity and capabilities? Now is the time to assess portfolio fit.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>As tattoos continue permeating mainstream culture, demand rises for specialized products that care for and maintain inked skin. An emerging category now exists for accessible, consumer-friendly aftercare targeting tattoo longevity. However, many whitespace opportunities remain for beauty brands seeking differentiation. By emphasizing inclusion, travel-ready formats, artist collaborations, and ritual-friendly integration, companies can craft compelling solutions. While still in its infancy, the tattoo aftercare segment shows substantial room for growth, innovation, and creative branding. The key is identifying unmet consumer needs around preserving artistic expression. Brands that solve for tattoo care priorities stand primed to ink their position within this promising space.</p> \n"}]}

One key shift is towards regenerative agriculture, which rehabilitates soil health through techniques like cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tilling. Beauty brands are increasingly turning to regenerative practices for their ingredients and products as consumers demand supply chain transparency and more natural, ethically-sourced formulas. This trend provides an opportunity for the industry to make substantive changes that benefit both the planet and product performance. Regenerative farming yields crops with enhanced mineral and phytonutrient levels, allowing brands to offer skin-nourishing, hair-strengthening formulas that also honor the earth. Read on to explore the drivers pushing regenerative agriculture to the forefront of the beauty industry and get advice for leveraging its benefits.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. The rise of regenerative beauty brands2. Scaling regeneration through supply chains3. Honoring local and traditional farming methods4. Offering more potent formulations5. Final words</p> \n<h2>The rise of regenerative beauty brands</h2> \n<p>A new wave of beauty brands are building their businesses around local, regenerative approaches from the ground up. These brands are establishing end-to-end supply chains where they control farming practices directly. For example, skincare company FaTH owns the farms that grow all their ingredients, giving them complete transparency. Meanwhile, French makeup brand Eclo only uses ingredients known for regenerative properties, like rye and hemp, and Italian skincare brand Seed to Skin sources from micro farms around the world.</p> \n<p>A key focus for these brands is collaboration, working closely with farmers and organizations to set regenerative criteria. Seed to Skin uses ingredients from over 50 regenerative farms and partners with groups like Regenerative Organic Certified to establish standards. Similarly, Eclo works with the organization Pour une agriculture du vivant to accelerate the transition to sustainable practices. This community-focused approach allows brands to implement regenerative models while ensuring fair compensation for farmers.</p> \n<p>By taking ownership of sourcing and production, these regenerative brands offer consumers transparency and deliver products that are good for skin and for the planet. Their deep engagement with farmers also preserves invaluable generational and ecological knowledge.</p> \n<h2>Scaling regeneration through supply chains</h2> \n<p>Large established brands are also realizing the benefits of regenerative agriculture and implementing sustainable changes across expansive global supply chains. Beauty industry leaders like YSL, Dior, and Unilever are collaborating with regenerative farming experts and launching long-term programs to transition their ingredient sourcing.</p> \n<p>For example, as part of its partnership with Re:Wild, YSL is reversing desertification in Morocco where it grows botanical ingredients by planting native tree species. Unilever has outlined a set of regenerative principles, like maintaining diverse crops and keeping living roots in the ground, for the millions of hectares of land used for its raw materials.</p> \n<p>These brands are taking a gradual, phased approach to the transition. In 2022, Guerlain reformulated a perfume range using organically grown, regenerative beetroot alcohol. Dior is converting its flower gardens to organic methods by 2030. Partnerships allow brands to identify priority ingredients, gather data, and determine the resources farmers need to adopt regenerative practices.</p> \n<p>While this monumental supply chain shift requires time and investment, it allows large corporations to scale sustainable impact. Monitoring progress and sharing transparent information helps consumers understand the journey. With clearer reporting and incentives for farmers, regeneration can spread across all levels of the supply chain.</p> \n<h2>Honoring local and traditional farming methods</h2> \n<p>When adopting regenerative agriculture, beauty brands must respect local and ancestral knowledge, as many regenerative techniques originate from Indigenous farming practices. Brands embracing hyper-local ingredients and revisiting traditions inherit more sustainable models that nourish both the land and communities.</p> \n<p>For example, Japanese skincare brand DAMDAM uses only heritage ingredients grown by regional regenerative farmers, purchasing whole crops to support local economies dependent on rare native plants. Organizations like the Laikipia Permaculture Centre in Kenya work to preserve pastoral lifestyles by teaching regenerative methods. UK brand Lush sources sustainably harvested aloe from this center to honor its preservation work.</p> \n<p>Maintaining an equitable approach is crucial when partnering with farmers. Brands should ensure fair wages, provide education on techniques, and empower communities to lead regeneration efforts themselves. Costa Rican female farming cooperative Coopecuna, which restores ecosystems, has increased incomes 300% by working with brands like Thrive Natural Care.</p> \n<p>By valuing traditional ecological knowledge as much as modern science, brands can develop innovative solutions in harmony with nature. Sourcing hyper-locally also reduces transportation emissions and stimulates rural businesses preserving generations of wisdom. Through collaboration and compensation, the beauty industry can leverage tradition to create a more sustainable future.</p> \n<h2>Offering more potent formulations</h2> \n<p>Regenerative agriculture provides another major benefit beyond sustainability \u2013 more nutritious ingredients that enhance product performance. Plants grown in healthy, living soil have higher levels of phytonutrients, antioxidants, and minerals. By using regeneratively grown botanicals, brands can create formulations that deliver visible results.</p> \n<p>For example, Belgian brand Terres D\u2019Afrique sources potent African ingredients from regenerative farms for its skincare, including nutrient-dense baobab and kigelia. Italian skincare brand Beauty Thinkers partners with a regenerative olive farm claiming its oil delivers more antioxidant hydroxytyrosol than conventional methods.</p> \n<p>Thrive Natural Care uses botanicals like juanilama and coralillo from Costa Rican farms to create \u201csuperplant oils\u201d full of nutrients that also rehabilitate degraded soil. True Botanicals conducted clinical trials on its calendula cream featuring regenerative calendula oil, proving increased hydration and skin barrier improvement.</p> \n<p>While regenerative ingredients offer formulation benefits, brands must back claims through research. Consumer education is also key, as \u201cregenerative\u201d and \u201csoil health\u201d are new concepts for many. Nevertheless, the opportunity to provide high-performing products with an ethical supply chain is driving more brands to rethink their sourcing.</p> \n<p>With healthier soils yielding more potent botanicals, the possibilities are boundless for developing clean, sustainable formulas that get real results. Regenerative agriculture merges ethics with efficacy in an exciting new chapter for the beauty industry.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Regenerative agriculture represents a true win-win for the beauty industry, allowing brands to implement ethical and sustainable practices while also enhancing product performance. By honoring ancestral wisdom and fostering transparency through localized partnerships, companies can nurture both pristine ingredients and customer trust. While transitioning supply chains requires gradual steps and investment, the opportunity to merge principle with potency makes regeneration well worth the effort. With conscientious brands leading the way, the future of sustainable beauty has healthy soil and even healthier consumers at its roots.</p> \n"}]}

As of October 2023, the hashtag#EyelashExtensionshas over 5 billion views on TikTok and over 20 million posts onInstagram. Whereas#EyelashTintand#BestLashSerumhave 79.5 million views and 122.6 million views respectively.</p> \n<h2>Why the market for mascara is dropping</h2> \n<p>Mascara sales are declining as newer brands struggle to compete in the costly and time-consuming research and development necessary to create traditional mascara products. Despite being a significant US $8.1 billion category in the beauty industry, mascara development often takes years of research and multiple formulations to perfect.</p> \n<p>Instead, emerging brands are focusing on alternative products like lash lifts, lash tinting, and extensions to capture a share of the global eyelash market. Lash lifts, for instance, offer a long-lasting curl without the need for daily mascara application and have gained popularity among consumers looking for a more natural look.</p> \n<p>Does that mean that beauty brands shouldn\u2019t carry mascara?No. There are still over 820k monthly searches for mascara, and it\u2019s still an essential product for many beauty consumers. However, consumer behavior changes drive interest in products like \u201coil-free mascara\u201d compatible with lash extensions.</p> \n<h2>Trending eyelash treatments</h2> \n<p>Common eyelash treatments include lash lifts, lash extensions and lash tints. Let\u2019s talk about what these treatments are:</p> \n<h3>Lash lifts</h3> \n<p>An eyelash lift, also known as a lash lift, is a cosmetic procedure designed to enhance the appearance of a person\u2019s natural eyelashes. It is a popular alternative to eyelash extensions and is often chosen by individuals who want to achieve a more lifted and curled lash look without the use of false lashes.</p> \n<p>During the treatment, silicone pads are applied to the eyelids, serving as a base for the lashes to be secured in their lifted position using a gentle adhesive. A specially formulated lifting solution is applied to soften and reshape the lashes. After the desired curl is achieved, a neutralizing solution sets the lashes in their lifted state.</p> \n<p>The results can last approximately 6\u20138 weeks, providing a natural, wide-eyed appearance that eliminates the need for eyelash curlers and mascara.</p> \n<h3>Lash tints</h3> \n<p>An eyelash tint treatment is a cosmetic procedure in which a specially formulated dye is applied to the eyelashes to darken their color. This process enhances the appearance of the lashes, making them look more prominent and defined.</p> \n<p>Eyelash tinting is popular for individuals with naturally light-colored lashes who want a more noticeable and mascara-like effect without needing daily mascara application. It\u2019s also convenient for people with busy lifestyles or participating in water-related activities, like swimming, as it eliminates the risk of mascara smudging or running.</p> \n<p>Lash tints are often done in conjunction with lifts.</p> \n<h3>At-home eyelash treatments</h3> \n<p>Consumers also use at-home treatments for their lashes, sometimes as an alternative to professional treatments and other times in conjunction with them. Many beauty consumers seek a more natural look \u2014 the#NaturalLasheshashtag on TikTok has 588.8 million views as of October 2023. The biggest trend in at-home treatments is eyelash serums, with 122.6 million views on TikTok.</p> \n<p>The most common at-home treatments include:</p> \n<h2>The rise of eyelash extensions \u2014 2024 trends</h2> \n<p>While a natural lash look is becoming more common with available treatments, many beauty consumers are still using eyelash extensions, often to achieve a more exaggerated look. A few trends have emerged in 2023 that will continue into 2024.

The growing focus on overall wellness and self-care presents an opportunity for beauty brands looking to expand into oral care. As consumers become more interested in the link between oral health and whole body health, they are seeking fresh approaches that make taking care of their teeth and gums feel like an elevated, multi-step skincare routine rather than a boring necessity. Brands that can provide innovative products with a focus on experience stand to benefit from this emerging trend of skinifying and indulging oral care. There is potential to boost health while creating personalized rituals that consumers look forward to.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Oral health as self-care2. Luxe, multi-step routines3. Sustainable innovations4. Engaging Gen Z and alphas5. Final words</p> \n<h2>Oral health as self-care</h2> \n<p>Consumers are gaining a deeper understanding of how oral health impacts overall wellbeing. The mouth is home to millions of bacteria, and the balance of good and bad bacteria makes up the oral microbiome. When the microbiome is thrown off, it can negatively affect areas far beyond the mouth, including the gut, heart, and brain. With this knowledge, people are realizing that caring for their oral health is an important act of self-care with implications for whole body health.</p> \n<p>Beyond just fighting plaque and cavities, consumers want products that proactively support the good bacteria for better long-term oral wellness. We are seeing innovations like toothpastes and mouthwashes that contain probiotics to add good bacteria. There is also growing interest in natural ingredients that have traditionally been used for oral health, like neem, clove, and myrrh. These signal a move away from harsh chemical ingredients.</p> \n<p>The skinification of oral care is also driving growth in areas like oil pulling and gua sha tools for the mouth and jaw. Tools that provide a deeper clean by physically removing buildup hold appeal. As consumers take a spa-like approach to oral care, products that allow them to feel and see results will rise in popularity. Brands have an opportunity to boost efficacy while also providing pampering, multi-sensory experiences.</p> \n<h2>Luxe, multi-step routines</h2> \n<p>Oral care is moving into the beauty space as consumers seek to elevate and indulge in their routines. Brands have an opportunity to make oral hygiene feel special rather than a chore. We see this with luxe ingredients like 24K gold, elegant packaging design, and positioning products as displayed objects.</p> \n<p>Multi-step routines are rising in popularity as consumers treat oral care as an act of self-care rather than a daily necessity. This mimics the extensive Korean skincare regimens that have become popular. Brands can encourage a ritualistic mentality by providing products meant to be used together in a system, similar to skincare\u2019s cleanse-tone-moisturize.</p> \n<p>Mouthwashes with soothing and refreshing properties beyond just targeting germs present an opportunity to create enjoyment. Breath sprays allow for quick freshness between brushing. Teeth whiteners, especially ones formulated with naturals like charcoal, give consumers an aesthetic benefit. Even floss comes in luxury formats like silk.</p> \n<p>There is room to get creative with formulations, textures, flavors, and scents \u2013 to make oral care something to savor rather than rush through. Packaging also matters, as products meant to be displayed on the counter allow consumers to think of oral care as part of their beauty routine. The key is balancing decadent sensorial experiences with oral health efficacy.</p> \n<h2>Sustainable innovations</h2> \n<p>Consumers want oral care solutions that are effective yet environmentally friendly. With single-use plastics like toothpaste tubes contributing to billions of pounds of waste annually, brands have significant room for improvement.</p> \n<p>We are seeing innovations like toothpaste tablets that remove the need for packaging altogether. Bamboo handles on toothbrushes appeal to sustainability-focused consumers. Refillable floss containers reduce waste from single-use plastic floss picks.</p> \n<p>Another eco-friendly approach is using naturally derived ingredients like neem and enzymes rather than synthetic chemicals with a larger carbon footprint. Products certified organic, vegan, or cruelty-free hold extra appeal.</p> \n<p>Technology can also play a role in sustainability for oral care. App-connected electric toothbrushes provide personalized feedback to optimize brushing efficiency and product lifespan. Solar-powered chargers eliminate battery waste.</p> \n<p>The key is ensuring sustainable products do not compromise on performance. Consumers want both ethical impact and oral health efficacy. Clever delivery formats like toothpaste bits or powders can reduce plastic while still delivering a thorough clean.</p> \n<p>Oral care brands have a responsibility to rethink formulations, packaging, and life cycle to reduce their environmental footprint. Those that can appeal to eco-conscious consumers while maintaining function stand to attract brand loyalty.</p> \n<h2>Engaging Gen Z and Alphas</h2> \n<p>Younger generations like Gen Z and Alphas are a major focus for oral care brands. These digital native cohorts get much of their health information from social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube. We see popular handles dedicated to education around products, routines, and conditions like orthodontics.</p> \n<p>While social platforms provide information, there is also opportunity for misinformation without proper guidance. Brands that team up with credible influencers to share advice can earn trust. Creating fun, engaging content is key, as this audience sees oral care as part of a beauty routine for self-expression.</p> \n<p>Collaborations with music artists, gamers, and other talents popular with Gen Z and Alphas gain attention over traditional healthcare endorsements. Brands embracing niche subcultures gain authenticity. Product formats like charcoal whitening powders appeal to DIY, experiential preferences.</p> \n<p>The key is making oral health relatable and approachable. Brands willing to meet younger generations where they are \u2013 on social media and with products suited for short attention spans \u2013 will connect best. There is room to boost care while nurturing a sense of creativity and individuality.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s oral care landscape provides opportunities for beauty brands seeking a new avenue for growth and engagement. By providing education alongside indulgent, eco-friendly products, companies can elevate dental care into a rewarding self-care ritual. With understanding and nuance, oral hygiene can become as addictive as skin care for consumers focused on total wellness and youthful self-expression. Brands that embrace this total body and planet mentality will shape the future routine.</p> \n"}]}

The most recent report shows that the global market for wigs was valued at US $6.13 billion in 2021, and experts predict that the market is projected to reach over US $11.8 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.63%.</p> \n<p>The influence of social media, celebrities, and influencer marketing is a driving force for the growth of the wig accessory market. Millions have access to thousands of videos dedicated to hair care, styling, and proper storage.</p> \n<h2>5 wig accessories to stock up on in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Wig brushes</h3> \n<p>Everyday brushes are too harsh on wigs, as they can stretch and pull out the hair. So, consumers can usewig brushesinstead. The primary purpose of this accessory is to detangle the hair and keep the wig soft and lush.</p> \n<p>But here\u2019s the kicker: businesses can invest in two types ofwig brushes: wire and loop brushes. In truth, both brushes are perfect for human and synthetic hair. They easily glide through the wig\u2019s hair fibers gently, preventing any damage from affecting the wig cap.</p> \n<p>Although both take care of wigs similarly, they have some major differences. For starters,loop brushesoften come with nylon bristles looping into the brush\u2019s bed. For this reason, most loop brushes have no tips, preventing strands of hair from getting snagged or caught in it.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,wire brushesoffer metal prongs that manufacturers cushion on the end with small bobbles. These wig brushes may also feature brushes made from wood, plastic, or silicone\u2014sometimes, a two-material combo.</p> \n<p>Wig brusheshold a decent amount of interest based on Google Ads data. They\u2019ve been attracting a healthy 4,400 monthly searches since March 2023, showing a steady stream of potential buyers for the accessory.</p> \n<h3>2. Wig stands</h3> \n<p>Wig standsdo a lot of things for the average consumer. They can help style, cut, and even store wigs, pushing them toward the ranks of must-have accessories.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers design these stands to mimic the shape of the head, allowing the wig to fall naturally when consumers place wigs on them. As a result, women can easily achieve a natural-looking style withtheir wigs.</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier,wig standsalso come in handy for cutting and restyling wigs. And they do these functions by providing sturdy support and a realistic picture of what the wig would look like on the wearer\u2019s head. As a benefit, they also help wigs maintain their gorgeous shape when not bobbing on a lady\u2019s head.</p> \n<p>More importantly, these accessories helpkeep wigsin breathable positions, keeping them fresh and ready to wear at all times. Plus, they\u2019re great for preventing wigs from trapping moisture and stopping unpleasant smells, mildew, and even mold.</p> \n<p>Wig standsalso don\u2019t take up a lot of space like mannequin heads, helping consumers to maintain a more minimalist aesthetic on their dressers. The best part is that they can also be collapsible, making them easy to fold and store when not in use.</p> \n<p>Wig stands are in high demand as Google Ads data reveals that they average 12,100 monthly searches. Interestingly, they\u2019ve maintained this search volume to October 2023\u2014a small but impressive, steady performance.</p> \n<h3>3. Wig storage</h3> \n<p>Consumers are always on the lookout for how best to store their wigs, and thankfully,wig storagecomes with different options, including a silk bag, regular wig bag, mannequin head, or polystyrene head.</p> \n<p>Silk bagsare usually a great option for human hair wigs, as they ensure no frizz in the hair when consumers pull them out of the bag. And they\u2019re ideal for traveling consumers\u2014they can rest assured that the hair will maintain its texture in the bag.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,regular wig bagsoffer longer storage options, often featuring hangers for convenience. Their designs ensure the hair stays unfolded and straight, especially when consumers hang them upright. They also protect the wig from direct sunlight and dust, a significant benefit for synthetic hair.</p> \n<p>Of all the storage options, amannequin headis the surest way to maintain the wig\u2019s shape while providing the means for the most accurate styling.

Consumers are seeking affordable products that can boost the health and growth of their natural brows and lashes. Brands have an opportunity to meet this demand with safe, high-performance formulas. But today\u2019s savvy shoppers want proof \u2013 they are looking for science-backed products with ingredients that deliver real results. Brands that can provide validated claims, quality formulas leveraging the latest skin and hair care tech, and sustainable business practices will come out ahead. Read on and look at the key trends shaping the brows and lashes product market, and how brands can align themselves with the needs of modern consumers who value natural beauty, product performance, and ethical brands.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. The rise of natural brows & lashes2. The power of proof3. Benefit-driven formulas4. Medical grade quality5. Sustainable and ethical6. Final words</p> \n<h2>The rise of natural brows & lashes</h2> \n<p>The trend towards natural-looking brows and lashes has accelerated in recent years. Whereas heavy, sculpted brows and false lashes were once popular, people are now embracing a more low-maintenance, understated aesthetic. Social media has played a role, with influencers and celebrities popularizing a softer, fluffier brow look and minimal mascara-only lashes. At the same time, the high cost and upkeep of brow laminations, microblading, lash extensions, and frequent false lash use has led many to seek affordable at-home products for natural enhancement.</p> \n<p>This shift aligns with a wider interest in clean, ethical beauty and self-care. Consumers want to move away from invasive procedures and embrace their natural features. Brands have an opportunity to develop products that gently boost brow and lash health, thickness, and length. Serums with active ingredients like peptides and biotin that condition brows and lashes are gaining popularity as are natural brow gels and mascaras that add subtle definition and length. By providing safe, effective alternatives to dramatic procedures, brands can align themselves with this fresh, effortless beauty ideal.</p> \n<h2>The power of proof</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s consumers are savvy \u2013 they want to see proof that a product delivers on its claims before they buy. This is especially true for brows and lashes items, where dramatic before-and-after transformations are promised. Brands that can back up their claims with scientific data and evidence will have a competitive edge.</p> \n<p>Clinical trials are the gold standard. When a third party scientifically evaluates a formula and finds it effective, it builds consumer trust. For example, lash serum brand Vegamour commissioned an independent study that verified their product improves lash density and fullness. Studies should be rigorous, with adequate sample sizes and control groups for valid statistical analysis.</p> \n<p>If clinical trials are not feasible, brands can still provide proof through other means. Before-and-after imagery can be powerful, but it must be high quality and realistic. Showing diverse consumers and unretouched photos enhances authenticity. Peer-reviewed articles on key active ingredients also demonstrate a scientific basis for products.</p> \n<p>Finally, detailed explanations of the research process \u2013 the story behind the science \u2013 appeals to today\u2019s educated beauty shoppers. Transparency about how formulas were developed and tested reassures consumers that proof was a priority. Brands who can back up claims with multiple types of credible evidence stand apart from the competition.</p> \n<h2>Benefit-driven formulas</h2> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly looking for multitasking products that provide layered benefits beyond the core function. This creates an opportunity for brands to incorporate ingredients and technologies from skin and hair care into brows and lashes formulas.</p> \n<p>For example, lash and brow serums can harness the power of peptides, amino acids, biotin, and botanical extracts \u2013 ingredients known to strengthen hair and stimulate growth. Drawing from skin care, formulas may also include hydrating and conditioning elements like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and oils to nourish brows and lashes.</p> \n<p>Cross-category inspiration also allows for innovative hybrid products. A lash primer that conditions like a serum while prepping lashes for mascara. A tinted brow gel with hair-thickening actives. Dual-sided liners with lash-enhancing brushes.</p> \n<p>These multifunctional products deliver added value for time-pressed, budget-conscious consumers seeking efficiency. They also tap into the trend of \u201cskinimalist\u201d routines, with fewer but higher-performing steps.</p> \n<p>Brands can educate consumers about the cross-category benefits by using familiar language from hair and skin care. Describing how formulas \u201cnourish fragile lashes\u201d or \u201cstrengthen thinning brows\u201d helps connect the dots. Clear communication paired with innovative formulas provides that coveted lightbulb moment \u2013 the realization that this product does far more than meets the eye.</p> \n<h2>Medical grade quality</h2> \n<p>There is a growing consumer preference for cosmetic products developed by doctors, scientists, and dermatologists. This medical-grade appeal now extends to brows and lashes. Brands with legitimate medical credentials and rigorous safety testing have an advantage.</p> \n<p>Ophthalmologist-formulated products inspire particular trust given the sensitive eye area. Consumers want reassurance that lash and brow formulas have been thoroughly tested for irritation and toxicity. Partnering with eye doctors, using ophthalmologist-approved ingredients, and conducting additional clinical testing communicates safety.</p> \n<p>Emphasizing safety is prudent given increasing concerns about eye wellness. With more exposure to screens and pollution, people want products supporting overall eye health. Formulas with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory botanicals appeal to this holistic beauty mindset.</p> \n<p>Medical-grade also signals professional-quality results. Clinical studies showing efficacy and real patient photos convey a formula\u2019s transformative potential. A clean, clinical brand aesthetic reminiscent of doctor\u2019s offices enhances the legitimacy.</p> \n<p>Counterintuitively, a clinical approach also provides a human touch lacking in influencer-fronted brands. By emphasizing the doctors behind the products, brands remind consumers that real experts developed these formulas with patients\u2019 best interests in mind.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the rise of physician-dispensed, ophthalmologist-approved cosmeceuticals reflects broader consumer preferences for science-backed, clinically tested products from trusted experts.</p> \n<h2>Sustainable and ethical</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s consumers demand that their beauty products reflect their values. Brands wanting to appeal to eco-conscious shoppers need to prioritize sustainability and ethical practices.</p> \n<p>For brows and lashes, this means using natural, biodegradable formulas free of toxic synthetics. Plant-based ingredients like peptides, aloe vera, and castor oil are excellent choices. Compostable, recyclable, or recycled packaging is also expected. Refillable options reduce waste.</p> \n<p>Transparency is equally important. Tracing ingredients back to their origin reassures consumers about ethics. Certifications like B-Corp, Leaping Bunny, and EWG Verified provide third-party validation. As do fairness commitments like paying living wages.</p> \n<p>Brand storytelling should emphasize values like compassion, inclusivity, and diversity. Feature inspirational founders, ethical supply chains, and charitable initiatives. Collaborations with nonprofits boost credibility.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, brands must back up their claims with meaningful action \u2013 consumers quickly detect greenwashing. Authenticity, radical transparency, and continuous improvement on ethics will appeal to conscientious shoppers.</p> \n<p>The brands that resonate most today go beyond simply delivering a good product. They also deliver peace of mind that purchases align with building a kinder, greener world.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s brows and lashes product brands have an exciting opportunity to align themselves with the evolving ethos of modern beauty consumers. By harnessing new science to safely enhance natural features, prioritizing ethics and inclusivity, and validating efficacy with proof, brands can become part of this new movement. Ultimately, the most successful brands will balance delivering natural, low-maintenance results that consumers want with the values-driven practices they demand. Brands that can master this balance are poised to become the defining brows and lashes brands of the future.</p> \n"}]}

This article will overview the key drivers and provide actionable advice for retailers looking to boost blush sales.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Blush layering creates demand for new shades2. Textural upgrades answer formulation pain points3. Fun and portable formats for on-the-go application4. Blush contouring and color theory drive experimentation5. Social media microtrends create further sales opportunities</p> \n<h2>1. Blush layering creates demand for new shades</h2> \n<p>The lifting of mask mandates across Asia has uncovered a whole new level of enthusiasm for blush. But it\u2019s not just a return to traditional pink tones. Social media and K-beauty trends have popularized color theory and blush layering techniques that create demand for new shades.</p> \n<p>By using pale and cool-toned blushes as a base layer, Asian consumers are finding they can experiment with bolder or warmer blushes that previously clashed with their skin tone. The soft layer creates a more natural, customized look. Milky, lavender, and muted blue shades have become staples for those with olive and yellow undertones who want to try trending neon pink blushes seen on K-pop stars.</p> \n<p>Online retailers should take note of this trend and expand their selection of pastel and pale blushes beyond the usual pinks. Stocking up on shades known for color-correcting properties will enable shoppers to recreate layered looks being promoted on Instagram and Douyin. Don\u2019t forget to merchandise these new shades alongside your bolder blushes and consider bundled deals. Displaying inspirational imagery of blush layering looks will further drive sales.</p> \n<p>The trend also presents an opportunity to provide education around undertones and color theory. This knowledge gives shoppers confidence to move beyond a simple swipe of pink. Retailers who position themselves as experts in this nuanced technique will build loyalty and community.</p> \n<h2>2. Textural upgrades answer formulation pain points</h2> \n<p>While excitement is strong, blush also comes with frustrations familiar to longtime users. The surge in masking caused many to realize just how easily traditional powders fade, transfer, or look chalky on the skin.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Asian brands have been innovating sophisticated textures that solve these problems. Whipped, creamy, and mud formulas create a more natural, long-lasting flush of color. Products like Clio\u2019s Air Blur Whip Blush offer richer pigmentation without looking cakey. Meanwhile \u201cblush serums\u201d from brands like FEEV pair hydrating skincare ingredients with buildable, lightweight colors.</p> \n<p>For retailers, showcasing these next-gen textures is key to capturing sales from shoppers looking to upgrade their makeup stash post-pandemic. Don\u2019t just stock the novel formats like blush sticks and liquids. Also ensure you have high-quality powder alternatives with blurring, skin-saving ingredients to appeal to a wide range of preferences.</p> \n<p>Merchandising will be important to educate customers on the performance benefits of new formulations. Create displays that invite them to test product feel and ease of application. Don\u2019t forget small samples so they can experience wear over several hours. Reviews and how-to\u2019s from influencers familiar with the latest Asian beauty trends will further spur customers to trade up.</p> \n<h2>3. Fun and portable formats for on-the-go application</h2> \n<p>While innovation is important, retailers should remember that convenience remains essential for time-pressed, on-the-go Asian consumers. Clever portable formats enable blush application anytime, anywhere.</p> \n<p>Mini and travel-sized compacts have always sold well in humid regions where touch-ups are a must. But now brands are creating even more fun, user-friendly designs tailored to busy lifestyles. Products like squishy blush serums and cooling color sticks make it enjoyable and mess-free to freshen up on the go.</p> \n<p>Multi-functional products are also popular as all-in-one solutions for color coordination across cheeks, lips, and eyes. Palettes and stacks with coordinated blush, lip, and eye shades streamline beauty routines. Shoppers appreciate the ability to create a cohesive look or customize combinations to suit their mood.</p> \n<p>For retailers, compact portability and effortless application will be key purchasing factors. Curate mini sets and on-the-go bundles that showcase your most user-friendly blush formats. Also, tap influencers to demonstrate quick touch-up techniques using these portable products. Emphasizing convenience will attract Gen Z and millennial shoppers who need makeup to fit flexibly into busy, modern life.</p> \n<h2>4. Blush contouring and color theory drive experimentation</h2> \n<p>While new textures and portability are important, the blush boom is also driven by consumers viewing their faces as a canvas for creative expression. The rise of blush contouring and online color analysis tests have inspired experimentation with placement and color choice.</p> \n<p>Using blush to sculpt and define facial features is now as common as using bronzer. Shoppers want shades that add natural dimension or drama depending on the look. Cool-toned purples and blues are popular for carving and highlighting smaller faces.</p> \n<p>Matching blush to skin undertones is also surging in importance, driven by DIY color-matching quizzes. Customers feel empowered to understand how their unique mix of overtones and undertones interacts with color. This knowledge allows more precision in shade selection.</p> \n<p>Retailers should provide the tools to guide this exploration. Expanding your range of blush shades and undertones is the first step. Promoting contour and color-theory content from influencers gives customers the insights they crave. Most importantly, invest in digital try-on technology. Virtual sampling satisfies the desire to experiment with new placement techniques and diverse shades. Guiding this self-discovery will position your store as the go-to blush destination.</p> \n<h2>5. Social media microtrends create further sales opportunities</h2> \n<p>While TikTok and Instagram continue driving the revival of blush overall, retailers should also pay attention to viral microtrends that create additional sales opportunities.</p> \n<p>For example, Grifgrips and other skin prep products went viral as users prepped for smooth blush application. Jelly blushes also surged in popularity for their luminous transparency. And beauty influencers popularized makeup melting sprays to seamlessly blend powder cheek products.</p> \n<p>Monitoring trending techniques and the tools they require allows retailers to capitalize in real time. Set up search alerts for key hashtags and influencer names on each platform. Lean into trends quickly by spotlighting related products through email campaigns and social posts. Collaborate with nano or micro-influencers to demonstrate trends using your assortment.</p> \n<p>While many microtrends will come and go, paying close attention ensures you can ride waves of opportunity. The small tools and novel products that enable trends are often affordable impulse purchases. Capturing this traffic along with larger blush sales keeps the growth coming.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion:</h2> \n<p>The blush rush presents a major opportunity for online retailers to tap into renewed enthusiasm and innovation in this category. By providing the latest textures, shades, and formats that meet consumer needs, retailers can capture pent-up demand as makeup routines accelerate post-pandemic.</p> \n<p>Focus on expanding your range of layered blush tones, next-gen formulations, and portable options to align with key trends. Merchandising and educating around techniques like blush contouring and color theory will further establish your authority. Pay close attention to microtrends on social platforms in order to react quickly.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, nurture your community of Makeup lovers through rich content, personalized recommendations, and inspiration. Brands that engage authentically, demonstrate expertise, and enable self-expression will win loyalty in the reinvigorated blush market. Make sure your assortment and customer experience position you for success as Asia\u2019s blush obsession continues.</p> \n"}]}

They\u2019re often made from soft fabrics like cotton or silk, with elastic straps over the head to keep them in place.</p> \n<p>Although the most common use for eye masks is for sleep, they can come in handy for other uses. For instance,eye masksare ideal for reducing puffiness and dark circles, soothing eye pain/irritation, and relieving headaches and migraines\u2014consumers love using them to promote relaxation.</p> \n<h2>Overview of the global eye mask market</h2> \n<p>The global eye mask market is currently estimated at USD 15.12 million, and it is expected to grow toUS $20.49 millionin 2028 at a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.42%.</p> \n<p>Other statistics relevant to the eye mask market include;</p> \n<h2>4 eye masks to leverage for more sales</h2> \n<h3>1. Contoured mask</h3> \n<p>Theseeye masksare the go-to option for consumers looking for extra support around the eyes. Their unique shape offers comfort and blocks lights from all angles while creating aperfect fitaround the consumer\u2019s eyes.</p> \n<h3>2. Beaded gel mask</h3> \n<p>These masksfeature special beads that absorb moisture and heat when consumers put them in boiling water. As a result,beaded gel maskscreate a soothing experience for consumers with tired, puffy, or baggy eyes.</p> \n<h3>3. Cloth mask</h3> \n<p>Cloth masksare the lightest and easiest-to-wear products available. Manufacturers make them from fabrics that consumers can wash and reuse several times without having issues. Plus, they\u2019re also gentle,making themgreat for sensitive skin with allergies or skin conditions.</p> \n<h3>4. Weighted mask</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers designweighted masksto apply gentle pressure to key areas of the face, including the forehead, cheekbones, temples, and jawlines. Interestingly,the pressureworks with the body\u2019s natural relaxation response to ensure longer and deeper sleep sessions.</p> \n<h2>Things to consider when choosing eye masks to sell in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>Selecting the right sleeping mask material is crucial for consumer comfort and product functionality. Cotton, a widely favored and breathable fabric, is popular for its high comfort. However, it may be harsh on sensitive skin and eyebrows.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, satin is a popular alternative for its gentle touch on the skin. But here\u2019s the catch: satin eye masks may generate more heat than necessary.</p> \n<p>Here are some other materials businesses can search for if the most common two (cotton and satin) don\u2019t fit their target consumer\u2019s interests:</p> \n<h3>Size and fit</h3> \n<p>Size is another factor that determines how comfortable consumers will be wearing eye masks. If they\u2019re too small, wearers will endure unnecessary pressure on their eyes, leading to potential issues like blurry vision or headaches.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, an oversized eye mask might fit loosely around the face, compromising its ability to block out light effectively. One of the best ways to ensure consumers get the optimal fit is by offering eye masks with adjustable straps.</p> \n<p>Such features allow wearers to customize their mask\u2019s length, ensuring they enjoy the sweet spot for the best sleeping experience. But it goes beyond that. Adjustable straps also help enhance light-blocking capabilities and accommodate different head sizes and shapes.</p> \n<h3>Weight</h3> \n<p>While manufacturers design most eye masks to be lightweight for enhanced comfort, alternative options are worth exploring for those seeking a unique sleep experience.</p> \n<p>So, if target consumers appreciate the effects of a weighted blanket, then weighted eye masks could be the perfect addition to their sleep routine. However, some consumers only want something slightly heavier than regular cloth masks.</p> \n<p>In such cases, retailers can stock up on slightly heavier materials like memory foams or double-textured eye masks.</p> \n<h3>Light-blocking ability</h3> \n<p>Some consumers need total darkness to sleep comfortably, so the eye mask design and material play big roles in determining light-blocking abilities. Stocking up on darker-colored fabrics is a great move, as they are more effective at blocking light than lighter hues.</p> \n<p>Regarding design, eye masks should be able to cover the eyes entirely, leaving no room for light to penetrate. For this reason, masks with contours over the nose are must-haves, as they help enhance light-blocking capabilities.</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, adjustable straps are another feature to prioritize for impressive light blocking. Padding is another feature that creates a dark, conducive environment for such consumers.</p> \n<p>Note: Light-blocking ability is not an important factor to consider if target consumers don\u2019t need pitch-black environments to sleep. Businesses can just offer regular eye masks for such users.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The ideal eye mask gives consumers thebest sleepand offers other interesting benefits. So, choosing the right one will keep them happy and encourage more sales in the long run.</p> \n<p>Luckily, this article provides everything businesses must know before entering the eye mask market in 2024. When sales start, leverage it to make the best offers and generate more profits.</p> \n"}]}

This poses serious health risks that disproportionately affect lower-income groups.</p> \n<p>To combat barriers to access, suncare brands are getting creative. Budget-friendly formulas offer quality protection at accessible price points. Bulk options like family-size formats and bundling deals maximize value. The rise of suncare subscriptions enhances convenience and loyalty.</p> \n<p>Forward-thinking brands are also sponsoring impactful sun poverty awareness campaigns and donations. By providing free SPF to schools and community centers in low-income areas, these initiatives help safeguard those most vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Ensuring sunscreen is stocked in dollar stores, pharmacies, and major retailers also improves access through distribution scale and convenience. Ultimately, creating affordable sun protection solutions available to all must remain a priority. Because when it comes to sun safety, no one should have to choose between health and household needs.</p> \n<h2>Suncare goes hybrid with skincare benefits</h2> \n<p>As sun protection becomes an everyday essential, suncare and skincare are converging. SPF innovations imbued with skin-nurturing benefits present an opportunity to appeal to daily sunscreen users seeking both protection and skincare results.</p> \n<p>Serum sunscreen hybrids are gaining popularity for their lightweight, fast-absorbing textures and ability to multitask. Combining sun filters with ingredients like vitamin C, squalane, and niacinamide, these formulas target sun protection while improving skin tone, hydration, and redness.</p> \n<p>To appeal to makeup wearers, SPF makeup hybrids feature skin-enhancing minerals and offer sun protection with a range of subtle tints to suit diverse skin tones. Waterless, clean formulas create breathable, lightweight makeup with sun filters ideal for daily use.</p> \n<p>Acne-prone consumers represent an underserved market for sun protection. Oil-free suncare hybrids with pore-minimizing ingredients provide invisible sun protection suitable for breakout-prone skin.</p> \n<p>Strategically combining sun filters with ingredients that target specific skin conditions can differentiate suncare hybrids. Overall, innovative formulas merging sun protection with complementary skincare benefits present opportunities to increase daily SPF compliance.</p> \n<h2>Snackable suncare solutions enable quick application</h2> \n<p>Innovative application formats are addressing a key barrier to regular sunscreen use \u2013 the hassle of application.

Combined with playful, eye-catching designs, snackable suncare makes UV defense more convenient and enjoyable. Removing barriers to use will be key to building UV safety habits.</p> \n<h2>Suncare around the world caters to local needs</h2> \n<p>As sun protection becomes a global priority, suncare innovations must consider regional and cultural nuances.

Brands in this region tout the protective benefits of mineral sunscreen innovation.</p> \n<p>Latin America\u2019s tropical and equatorial climates call for water resistance and sweatproof claims. Brands also market the anti-aging benefits of sun protection to appeal to beauty-focused consumers.</p> \n<p>In the Middle East and Africa, lightweight gel-creams and milk textures suit hot, arid conditions. Natural suncare lines utilize indigenous ingredients like baobab, marula, and kalahari melon oils to appeal to values around skin nourishment.</p> \n<p>Beyond filters, offering solutions like scalp powders and after-sun recovery balms meets locale-specific needs. Overall, nuanced suncare innovation demonstrates understanding of diverse consumer values and lifestyles region to region.</p> \n<h2>Beyond the face: SPFs for hair and hands</h2> \n<p>With rising sun awareness, suncare is expanding beyond facial products to protect vulnerable areas like the scalp, hair, and hands.</p> \n<p>Seeking solutions for UV damage and dryness, consumers look to SPF haircare. Lightweight mists or dry shampoos with UV filters allow for easy application on hair and scalp without weighing down locks. These portable formats suit active lifestyles.</p> \n<p>For bald and balding consumers concerned about skin cancer risks, SPF scalp formulas provide vital protection. The mattifying formulas blended for scalp use ensure safe sun defense.</p> \n<p>Hands also require specialized sun protection as they experience significant sun exposure but rarely get applied with facial SPF. Silky hand creams with high SPF defend against premature aging while delivering moisturization to overwashed hands.</p> \n<p>By taking a whole-body approach to sun safety, suncare brands demonstrate an understanding of overlooked risks like scalp burns and hand photo-damage. Specialized SPFs for hair and hands fill important gaps beyond facial protection.</p> \n<h2>Final takeaways</h2> \n<p>As sun protection becomes an undisputed everyday essential on par with soap and deodorant, suncare brands have a responsibility to ensure products are affordable, inclusive and accessible to all. Clever hybrids that merge sun protection with skin-nurturing ingredients will appeal to consumers seeking efficiency. For time-poor and on-the-go lifestyles, portable solutions like powders, sticks and mists check the convenience box. And it\u2019s not just about facial suncare anymore \u2013 scalp and hair formulas and hand creams meet the growing need for full-body protection. With climate change exacerbating sun damage, ongoing consumer education remains vital.

Learn about the trending ingredients to know, new applications, and sourcing considerations. With the lines between beauty and wellness increasingly blurred, these plant-based solutions provide holistic stress relief.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents:1. Emerging adaptogenic ingredients with skincare benefits2. Elevated formulas combining adaptogens and actives3. Soothing adaptogenic solutions for hair and scalp4. Adaptogens in holistic beauty formats</p> \n<h2>1. Emerging adaptogenic ingredients with skincare benefits</h2> \n<p>The fungi frenzy shows no signs of slowing down. Antioxidant-rich chaga mushrooms are the star ingredient in South Korean brand SerumKind\u2019s Chaga Charging Drop. The serum repairs damage caused by external irritants and offers deep moisturization. Snow mushrooms, also known as tremella fuciformis, are said to be more hydrating than hyaluronic acid due to their smaller particle size.</p> \n<p>Other flora like gotu kola (centella asiatica) harness key skincare benefits. Known as the \u201cfountain of youth\u201d in Sanskrit, gotu kola is a source of antioxidants and has firming and anti-wrinkle benefits. Echinacea, often associated with immunity, has shown promise as an acne and oil-control ingredient.</p> \n<p>New Nordic ingredients like cloudberry are also gaining prominence. Rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, and omegas, cloudberry has been used by Vikings and Inuit for its brightening and nourishing properties. This hero ingredient is featured in Lumene\u2019s Nordic-C range.</p> \n<p>When introducing novel ingredients, clinical testing and sourcing transparency will gain consumer confidence. Scientists have ethically and sustainably sourced centella asiatica from Madagascar, clinically proven to improve radiance and suppleness.</p> \n<h2>2. Elevated formulas combining adaptogens and actives</h2> \n<p>As consumers become more knowledgeable about skincare ingredients and their effects, science-meets-nature formulations continue to gain popularity by appealing to skintellectual shoppers who want both skin health and visible performance from their products.</p> \n<p>Formulas that strategically pair adaptogenic ingredients with tried-and-tested active skincare ingredients are rising to meet this demand. Some natural and clean beauty brands are combining antioxidant-rich mushrooms like reishi and tremella with buzzy multifunctional naturals like bakuchiol in face oils and serums. This allows them to offer products with a wide range of skin-enhancing benefits from a short ingredient list.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the soothing and balancing properties of adaptogens are being utilized to offset the potential irritation or dryness that can come with using more potent active ingredients. This creates formulas that are simultaneously results-driven yet also repairing and gentle for all skin types. For example, one luxury European skincare brand uses a trio of calming mushroom extracts to create balance and help restore the skin\u2019s moisture barrier while also including a high concentration of youth-boosting vitamin C known for its sensitizing effects.</p> \n<p>Skincare brands can also prioritize adaptogens that work synergistically to boost the efficacy and benefits of other proven active ingredients in the formula. For instance, one clean clinical skincare brand combines a reishi and shiitake mushroom complex, which is clinically shown to brighten skin tone, with established pigmentation-fighting actives like tranexamic acid and niacinamide in their advanced brightening serum. This allows them to offer fast results by maximizing the potential of each ingredient.</p> \n<h2>3. Soothing adaptogenic solutions for hair and scalp</h2> \n<p>With high rates of stress and post-illness hair loss during the pandemic, consumer focus has shifted more heavily to overall hair and scalp health. Adaptogenic ingredients used traditionally for centuries are gaining mainstream popularity for their abilities to promote healthier hair growth starting from the roots.</p> \n<p>For example, amla, an adaptogenic antioxidant-rich Indian gooseberry that has roots in Ayurvedic medicine, has been shown in studies to help tackle hair loss and greying. One haircare brand highlighted this ingredient in a range focused on strengthening hair follicles and preventing pigmentation loss through increased collagen production.</p> \n<p>Inspired by Ayurvedic practices, another brand introduced a shampoo and conditioner targeted to soothe scalps after postpartum hair loss, which affects up to 50% of women according to research. Formulas contain ashwagandha and amla to condition strands and calm irritated, flaky scalps.</p> \n<p>Responsible sourcing is also a priority as brands use ingredients like he shou wu, a Chinese medicinal herb traditionally used for its hair-boosting properties. Seeking transparency, some brands detail where each ingredient is ethically sourced from via supply chain maps. Further, they offset related waste by replanting ingredients like kelp in indigenous coastal regions.</p> \n<p>For holistic hair health, brands can boost adaptogens\u2019 stress-busting effects through adjacent rituals and tools. One brand offers a handcrafted scalp massager and shares massage techniques on its website inspired by time-honored traditions to promote at-home self-care.</p> \n<h2>4. Adaptogens in holistic beauty formats</h2> \n<p>Though starting in supplements, skin and hair focused adaptogen pills and powders target holistic beauty seekers.</p> \n<p>As the line blurs between outer and inner beauty, brands combine topicals with ingestibles. One brand offers a Nordic adaptogen serum alongside an adaptogen supplement for complementary skin immunity benefits from rhodiola, ginseng and cloudberry.</p> \n<p>This inside-out approach also applies to haircare. A brand\u2019s body serum and adaptogenic elixir powder both contain ashwagandha and holy basil to target stress both externally and internally.</p> \n<p>Drinkable beauty taps into this too. An adaptogen collagen powder blends maca and butterfly pea flower to be whisked into a brightening blue latte. Herbal coffee startups add adaptogens for function over flavor.</p> \n<p>The convenience of powders or easy drinking formats fits varied routines. Brands utilize traditional ingredients like Ayurvedic ashwagandha and Chinese herbs in modern applications.</p> \n<h3>Conclusion:</h3> \n<p>Adaptogenic ingredients present vast opportunities for beauty brands seeking on-trend natural ingredients that align with consumer priorities like ethical sourcing, clinical backing for claims, and holistic wellness.\u00a0 As research on adaptogens\u2019 multifaceted benefits continues to grow, their applications in beauty, haircare, and ingestible formats will expand as well. With impressive potential still being uncovered, adaptogens are emerging ingredients to watch in the beauty space.</p> \n"}]}

One easy solution is lip oils, which are taking over the beauty world thanks to their cool new formulations, helping to make lips soft and succulent again.</p> \n<p>Lip oils are like a magic potion for lips, mixing nourishment and hydration to turn even the flakiest, driest lips into their softest, smoothest, and healthiest renditions. As a bonus, they give lips a gorgeous glossy sheen, making them look even more appealing.</p> \n<p>Here, we\u2019ll take a closer look at why beauty-related businesses will want to stock up on lip oils in 2024. But first, let\u2019s compare to other lip products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are lip oils, and how do they compare to other lip products?What are the benefits of lip oils?Six factors to consider when choosing lip oils in 2024Conclusion</p> \n<h2>What are lip oils, and how do they compare to other lip products?</h2> \n<p>Lip oilsare the ultimate solution for dry lips. They give lips the sparkle of glass, the deep hydration of a balm, and a touch of color like a lightweight lipstick. They\u2019re also becoming incredibly popular, with Google Ads data showing that they received an impressive 201,000 searches since June 2023.</p> \n<p>Lips can often become dry and irritated due to factors like smoking, sun exposure, and cold weather. That\u2019s wherelip oilsstep in to save the day!</p> \n<p>Unlike traditional lip balms that often rely on a heavy dose of wax and butter, lip oils come from nutrient-rich natural oils. This mix of natural oils is easier to absorb into the skin, reaching even the deepest layers, creating a soft and supple surface.</p> \n<h2>What are the benefits of lip oils?</h2> \n<p>Lip oilsare all the rage, and the secret behind their popularity is simple: they work wonders by soothing and moisturizing lips with nourishing ingredients like jojoba, sunflower seeds, and raspberry oils. What\u2019s even better is that they\u2019re packed with antioxidants and essential fatty acids that keep delicate lips well-protected.</p> \n<p>Lip oilsdon\u2019t feel greasy or heavy. Well-formulated lip oils are quick-absorbing and lightweight, giving a comfortable, non-sticky experience.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Lip oils may also come with other ingredients to embellish specific aspects of lip health. For example, some variants include vitamin E, which helps to reduce wrinkles and fine lines, while others might contain hyaluronic acid, helping to plumpen lips.</p> \n<h2>Six factors to consider when choosing lip oils in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Ingredients</h3> \n<p>While mostlip oilsare made using natural ingredients, it\u2019s good to be aware that some may contain potentially harmful ingredients like parabens, artificial fragrances, and harsh chemicals.</p> \n<p>Avoid such products as they may cause unwanted reactions. Instead, look forlip oilswith natural and nourishing ingredients, like plant oils (e.g., coconut oil, jojoba oil, argan oil), shea butter, vitamin E, and antioxidants.</p> \n<h3>Hydration duration</h3> \n<p>People buylip oilsmainly to keep their lips from getting dry. Retailers will therefore want to source products that contain fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants, which keep lips hydrated for a long time and prevent chapping. Argan oil is a perfect example of a fatty acid that helps with hydration.</p> \n<h3>Texture and finish</h3> \n<p>Lip oilscome in all sorts of textures, from light and not too oily to slightly thicker varieties that give lips a glossy look. Pick textures that your target customers are likely to find comfortable based on their preferences \u2013 whether it\u2019s a natural shine or a glossier look.</p> \n<h3>Scent and flavor</h3> \n<p>Lips oils often come in various scents and flavors. If you\u2019re unsure which to choose, opt for subtle but sweeter scents and flavors like strawberry, lavender, vanilla, etc. Avoidlip oilswith strong artificial scents as consumers with sensitive skin are less likely to buy them.</p> \n<h3>SPF protection</h3> \n<p>Don\u2019t forget about SPF protection when pickinglip oils, especially if your target consumers live in an especially sunny part of the world. Lip oils with a strong SPF rating provide a solid defense against pesky UV rays, helping to prevent dry lips.</p> \n<h3>Packaging</h3> \n<p>Also, consider thelip oil\u2019spackaging. As a rule of thumb, tubes or applicators that are easy to use and hygienic are the best bet for investment. Plus, the packaging should be secure and leak-proof so as to avoid leakage when carried in a bag or pocket.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Lip oils bring a unique twist to the world of lip products. They\u2019re not as gooey as glosses, lighter than balms, and less colorful than lipsticks, yet they\u2019ve got everything consumers need to keep their lips healthy and velvety soft.</p> \n<p>Before choosing which varieties to stock, carefully consider the factors discussed above.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re looking for the latest in lip oils and accessories, browse thousands of varieties onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

Recent insights into pollution and sensitivity along with advanced formulations are enabling cleansers to move beyond their utilitarian roots. Now these fundamental products are integrating actives and hybrid textures while still respecting skin barriers. This renaissance means cleansers can address specific needs from acne to visible signs of aging.

Effortless SPF removal5. Final words</p> \n<h2>The power of targeted cleansing</h2> \n<p>The era of generic, one-size-fits-all cleansers is over. Today\u2019s consumers want washes that address their specific skin concerns, from acne and hyperpigmentation to sensitivity and visible signs of aging. Brands are answering this demand with specialized cleansers packed with targeted actives.</p> \n<p>For example, cleansers are now integrating ingredients like salicylic acid, traditionally used in leave-on treatments. Using the concept of short contact therapy, these washes combat acne by allowing the acid to penetrate pores during the cleansing time. Other brands harness the power of PHAs like gluconolactone to offer gentle exfoliation.</p> \n<p>In addition to leveraging single hero ingredients, cleansers are also taking a synergetic approach to actives. Combining peptides, AHAs, PHAs and more within washes tackles multiple skin goals like reducing fine lines while refining texture.</p> \n<p>The most compelling targeted cleansers tell a sensory story along with the functional. Cream-to-foam and oil-to-milk textures provide an indulgent, spa-like experience while ingredients go to work. Hybrid formats like these skip the double cleanse for a streamlined routine.</p> \n<p>Brands seeking to upgrade their cleanser offerings should focus on specialty ingredients like actives tailored to unique skin types and concerns. Sensorial textures also provide tangible proof that these next-gen cleansers go beyond basic washing to deliver transformative results. The future for those who embrace the power of precision looks bright.</p> \n<h2>Meet the hybrid cleanser-conditioners</h2> \n<p>Inspired by the \u201cno poo\u201d movement in hair care, hybrid cleanser-conditioners are paving the way to shortcut skincare routines. These multitasking formulas offer a deep cleanse while delivering conditioning benefits, eliminating the need for a separate moisturizing step.</p> \n<p>Oil-and-water emulsions are one route to fusion cleansing and conditioning. These systems harness the makeup-melting power of oils and silicones to cut through impurities. Then the water-based phase kicks in to whisk away residue without parching skin, thanks to hydrators like glycerin.</p> \n<p>Texture-transforming balms also provide the one-two punch of cleansing and conditioning. These balms begin as a solid balm or thick gel. As users massage the formula into skin, the friction melts them into a silky oil or creamy milk. The oil phase dissolving impurities transitions into a hydrating liquid.</p> \n<p>The formulas powering these hybrids draw on gentle yet effective surfactant blends. Using the right emollients, humectants, and occlusives further ensure the formulas clean without compromise to the moisture barrier. Pre, pro- and postbiotics additionally nurture the skin microbiome.</p> \n<p>For brands seeking to condense routines with hybrids, positioning them as an indulgent treat delivers strong appeal. Highlighting the sensorial experience along with the simplified regimen and skin health benefits will capture interest. Offering hybrid cleansing balms in luxe textures like buttery balms or whipped creams enhances the pampering profile.</p> \n<h2>Balancing cleansing for healthier skin</h2> \n<p>As awareness grows around skin barrier health and microbiome balance, cleansers are evolving beyond their reputation for disruption. New gentle, soothing formulas cleanse without compromise to moisture and microbiome equilibrium.</p> \n<p>Protecting the acid mantle is top of mind for these barrier-friendly cleansers. They leverage low-pH formulas, avoiding alkaline disruption linked to irritation and sensitivity. Gentle surfactants like sucrose cocoate maintain mildness. These cleansers also pack barrier-building ingredients like ceramides to support skin\u2019s processes.</p> \n<p>Since inflammation catalyzes many skin issues, anti-inflammatory components like niacinamide calm and reinforce during cleansing. Seeking to mitigate reactivity from common sensitizers, brands are offering cleansers designed for reactive and eczema-prone skin types. Ultra-gentle formulas with oat extracts and peptides nourish even the most sensitive.</p> \n<p>Probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics nurture the microbiome, while botanicals soothe skin. With a nod to Ayurvedic tradition, stress-busting adaptogens like ashwagandha make an appearance to curb inflammation. Avoiding drying alcohols and the common irritant fragrance puts the focus fully on skin health.</p> \n<p>Brands seeking to restore skin resilience should foreground barrier protection and microbiome balance in their cleanser ranges. Clever blends of skin-synergistic extracts and ferments differentiate while delivering on healthy skin promises. The opportunity to embrace true gentleness represents the next wave in cleansing.</p> \n<h2>Effortless SPF removal</h2> \n<p>As awareness grows around daily SPF use, effectively removing sunscreen without irritation has become a pain point. New cleansers tackle this issue with formulas targeting efficient sun protection removal.</p> \n<p>Seeking foolproof SPF removal, consumers want cleansers with the power to thoroughly break down UV filters without rubbing or redness. Gentle enough for frequent use, these cleansers must prep skin for irritation-free reapplication too.</p> \n<p>Addressing this need, brands are optimizing surfactant selection and concentration to cut through tenacious waterproof or mineral SPF residues. Emollients ensure the formulas maintain mildness during this deep cleansing process. Fruit-based enzymes offer extra dissolving action to lift SPF built up in pores.</p> \n<p>Some brands pair these SPF removal cleansers with their sun protection offerings for an integrated system. Single and dual-phase oil cleansers excel at effortlessly melting away sunscreen. Educating consumers on using oil cleansing in place of makeup wipes reduces waste while getting sunscreens off completely.</p> \n<p>Clean rinsing gels, oils, and balms simplify SPF removal from face and body without drying out skin in the bargain. Light hydrating layers under SPF allow these cleansers to refresh skin for next-day protection. Gentle enough for daily use, these targeted formulas upgrade day-to-day cleansing.</p> \n<p>Brands have an opportunity to build regimen efficiency around SPF by creating dedicated cleansers strong enough to remove filters thoroughly yet mild enough for maintenance cleansing. Clever formulas can make light work of a daily essential step.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The cleanser renaissance opens an exciting new chapter where these fundamental products move beyond basic washing into specialized skin care. Leveraging targeted ingredients and hybrid formats, today\u2019s high-performing cleansers address specific concerns from acne to visible aging while respecting skin health. Brands seeking first-mover advantage should emphasize barrier protection and microbiome balance alongside results-focused, sensory formulations. With consumer interest rising, now is the time for forward-thinking brands across sectors to give cleansers their richly deserved time in the spotlight through skin-smart innovation.</p> \n"}]}

However, unlike standard mirrors, smart mirrors require a two-way mirror because they need light to pass through from behind to view the display.</p> \n<p>Smart mirrors typically have built-in LED lighting that can be customized to simulate various lighting conditions, such as natural daylight or evening lighting. This feature helps users achieve optimal makeup application. Other features include the ability to play music or other Bluetooth features like making phone calls or accessing the apps on the consumer\u2019s phone.</p> \n<p>Smart mirror technology is improving, which can be used for specific beauty and fitness applications. One incredible feature of smart mirrors is the virtual makeup try-on. With augmented reality technology and built-in cameras, smart mirrors can superimpose makeup products like lipstick, eyeshadow, and blush onto their reflection in real time. This is not only incredible technology for consumers, but beauty brands can take advantage of this technology in physical retail locations to help customers choose the best products.</p> \n<h3>How smart mirrors revolutionize the makeup routine</h3> \n<p>Not only do smart mirrors have features that enhance makeup application for consumers with adjustable lighting and cameras, but they can also provide beauty analysis and assist with choosing products.

Offering focused solutions, playful aesthetic, and sustainability, patches present opportunities across beauty categories. This article will dive into the top trends propelling patch popularity, spotlight innovative offerings, and provide actionable insights to capitalize on this burgeoning trend. In a sea of exhaustive rituals and unattainable self-care, patches provide accessible, supplemental support. With smart branding and development, patches can empower people to embrace simple solutions while having fun along the way.</p> \n<p>Table of Contents1.

An eye for skincare: Targeted rejuvenation in patch form5. Final thoughts</p> \n<h2>Wellness with ease: Simplified solutions through patches</h2> \n<p>As the pursuit of wellbeing expands, people seek simplified supplemental solutions. Wellness patches provide targeted relief through transdermal delivery, acting as \u201cbiohacks\u201d for wellness and performance.</p> \n<p>With extensive self-care rituals often unattainable, patches offer accessible options. Amid the ongoing turbulence of modern life, many desire support for mental health and stress management. Patches utilizing aromatherapy principles will gain traction for delivering uplifting scents and promoting mindfulness. For example, aromatherapy brand Subtle Energies\u2019 Rasayana Patch promotes energized focus through Ayurvedic oils.</p> \n<p>Additionally, patches tackling overlooked health concerns will prove valuable. Offering discreet, holistic solutions, patches for issues like menopause or menstrual discomfort will appeal to those wanting natural options. Brands such as Genexa and The Honey Pot Company address women\u2019s wellness through ingredient-conscious patches.</p> \n<p>Rather than aiming to replace rituals, wellness patches act as beneficial supplements. With limited time for extensive self-care, people want convenient and cost-friendly additions to support their goals. By providing science-backed solutions in simplified formats, wellness patches can enhance wellbeing in bite-sized steps.</p> \n<h2>Positivity speaks volumes: Celebrating skin individuality with patches</h2> \n<p>Pimple patches are taking the spotlight, offering effective solutions while promoting skin-positivity. Initially popularized in South Korea, these acne-targeting patches deliver ingredients directly to blemishes while protecting from irritation. Playful designs and messaging aim to destigmatize acne.</p> \n<p>For example, brands like Starface and Hero Cosmetics feature whimsical shapes and packaging with uplifting slogans like \u201czit happens.\u201d This celebrates acne as a normal part of life, reflecting rising skin-positive attitudes. TikTok is flooding with skin acceptance content under hashtags like #skinpositivity.</p> \n<p>Patches go beyond just pimples too. Brand Fur tackles ingrown hairs through microdart patches allowing for targeted application. Extending spot-targeting tech to other concerns provides effective solutions for all skin types.</p> \n<p>However, sustainability will need addressing as single-use formats prevail. Opting for biodegradable materials or reusable patches are opportunities. Dieux offers durable hydrogel eye patches that last up to 30 uses. Adding reusable, skin-kind ingredients also fits with the clean beauty movement\u2014a win-win for brands.</p> \n<p>Overall, fun branding plus skin science positions pimple patches to promote positivity. As skincare meets self-care, patches provide an upbeat twist on problem-solving for all ages.</p> \n<h2>Innovations under the sun: New technology for safe sun practices</h2> \n<p>As awareness of sun safety grows, brands are responding with innovative patches to protect and inform. The global suncare market continues expanding as education increases, creating opportunities.</p> \n<p>Targeted sun patches allow for protection of sensitive areas like around eyes or on cheeks where makeup slides. Breathable and sweat-proof, these patches suit outdoor activities. Brands like Shionle and GolfDoesMatter cater to outdoor enthusiasts in Asia-Pacific markets.</p> \n<p>Additionally, technology can teach safe sun habits through patches with built-in UV detection. Kinl\u00f2 offers hydrating sun stickers that change color upon overexposure, directing when to reapply protection. These photographer-founded stickers are suitable for all skin tones.</p> \n<p>For in-depth tracking, My UV Patch by La Roche-Posay is an ultra-thin sensor that monitors UV exposure levels over several days. Users can then adjust protection accordingly, making it a powerful educational tool.</p> \n<p>However, limits exist. Critics argue detection technology can provide a false sense of security. Combining patches with continued safety practices is key. Fostering awareness of how factors like clouds still permit 90% of UV rays to pass through is important.</p> \n<p>With innovation and education combined, suncare patches present opportunities. Still, promoting overall sunlight moderation and protection remains vital for whole-body wellness.</p> \n<h2>An eye for skincare: Targeted rejuvenation in patch form</h2> \n<p>Patches are proving popular for targeting skincare concerns and enhancing routines. Especially for issues like fine lines or dark circles, topical patches deliver ingredients directly where needed. Both skincare veterans and newcomers find these fuss-free formats appealing.</p> \n<p>Under-eye patches tackle tiredness and puffiness in a flash. Brands like Patchology and Wander Beauty offer hydrogel and collagen-infused options to refresh eyes pre-Zoom. For issues like hyperpigmentation, Faded formulates with melanated skin specifically in mind.</p> \n<p>Wrinkle patches also aim to smooth and prevent fine lines using gentle compression. However, efficacy claims are debated. Still, as a low-risk option before investing in expensive procedures, silicone anti-aging patches intrigue consumers.</p> \n<p>Sustainability is front of mind, driving reusable and reduced-waste patches. Haeckels\u2019 compostable eye masks and Dieux\u2019s durable hydrogel both keep landfill impact low without compromising on ingredients.</p> \n<p>While single-use formats prevail for efficacy, reusables present opportunities. With smart patch placement and quality materials, skincare goals need not conflict with eco-values.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, positioning patches as supplements provides flexibility. Instead of disrupting routines, they can gently enhance without pressure to overhaul regimens. Meeting skincare needs while keeping things simple allows patches to aid overall wellbeing.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Patches present an opportunity to provide targeted solutions while having fun with design and sustainability. Investing in compostable or reusable materials, promoting skin-positivity, tackling overlooked concerns, and utilizing technology can help retailers capitalize on this trend. Most importantly, positioning patches as supplements rather than replacements will allow them to enhance rather than disrupt existing routines. With smart branding and product development, retailers can empower consumers to embrace patch power in 2024 and beyond.</p> \n"}]}

Japanese haircare applies the principle of being gentle regardless of hair type and for all ages. Similar to the Japanese preference for skincare, consumers favor natural botanical oils and routines that nurture scalp health.</p> \n<p>Products formulated for oily scalps emphasize moisture-boosting properties as a means of regulating sebum production. Cult favorite brand &honey\u2019s Herb Smooth hair series for oily scalps boasts a lock-in moisture formula that balances the moisture level of the scalp over time instead of stripping oil. Ingredients are organic, 90% naturally derived, and additive-free, gentle enough for the whole family to use.</p> \n<p>Other brands use native herbs that borrow from centuries-old Japanese beauty traditions.

As consumers increasingly seek gentler, healthier haircare regimens, Japanese formulas offer a compelling alternative to harsh Western shampoos. Retailers should focus on showcasing the core traits that make J-beauty stand out, and highlight gentle, plant-based ingredients like camellia oil that soothe scalps and strands. They should also bring in efficient masks, lotions, and balms that simplify routines for busy consumers, source aromatherapeutic and onsen-inspired products that turn washing into a relaxing ritual, and stock-targeted solutions for maturing hair that empower older consumers.</p> \n"}]}

As an online retailer, it\u2019s crucial to understand the top trends to stock cutting-edge products. This article will overview the five key trends and how to leverage them.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsUnexpected upcycled ingredientsScalp microbiome solutionsBlue biotechNeuro-driven scentsAgeing skinnovationsConclusion</p> \n<h2>Unexpected upcycled ingredients</h2> \n<p>Upcycled ingredients continue gaining popularity with sustainably-minded consumers. Suppliers are now looking beyond the food industry to source unique waste streams.</p> \n<p>For example, The Upcycled Beauty Company\u2019s Cherishd Hair and Scalp Spray utilizes 100% upcycled ingredients and compostable packaging. P2 Science makes a liquid polymer from forest-derived terpenes upcycled from the paper industry. Mielikki Nordic contains extracts from boreal trees and Arctic fungi to prevent skin inflammation.</p> \n<p>As a retailer, focus on true circular economy principles, not just marketing stories. Require certifications and traceability to validate upcycling claims. Ashland uses rosewood chips discarded from fragrance distillation, with full CITES documentation.</p> \n<p>Prioritize ingredients that give waste a second life. But also ensure transparent, ethical sourcing through credible third parties. This shows a genuine commitment to sustainability.</p> \n<h2>Scalp microbiome solutions</h2> \n<p>The scalp microbiome has become a focus for overall hair health. Exhibitors showcased active ingredients to soothe and replenish the scalp.</p> \n<p>For example, GreenTech\u2019s HAIRLINE uses \u201celixir of life\u201d roots to rebalance the scalp microbiota and prevent hair loss. Bicobiome has a scalp renewal system to rebalance an oily scalp and remove dandruff.</p> \n<p>As a retailer, choose scalp-focused ingredients with sustainable compositions to attract eco-conscious consumers. For example, ALGAKTIV\u2019s bioSKN contains sustainable microalgae proven to rebalance dry and oily scalps.</p> \n<p>Meet the demand for skinified haircare by offering solutions that tend to the scalp microbiome. Opt for natural, regenerative ingredients that align with your brand values. Market products with specific scalp benefits like anti-dandruff and hair strengthening.</p> \n<p>Educate customers that scalp health is fundamental for beautiful, healthy hair. Promote a regular scalp care regimen as part of a holistic haircare routine.</p> \n<h2>Blue biotech</h2> \n<p>Biotechnology remains a key player in sustainable ingredients, as marine biotech offers new possibilities.</p> \n<p>For example, Givaudan\u2019s Gravity harnesses red macroalgae biomarkers to promote hydration and antioxidants. Their B-Lightyl uses marine biotech to gently erase dark spots. Radiant\u2019s Bee.FENCE boosts skin immunity with sea-grown spinach fermented with bee lactobacillus.</p> \n<p>As a retailer, highlight biotech\u2019s environmental advantages to appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Provide education on sustainable processes like fermentation versus extraction. Promote clinically tested products to build trust and convey benefits.</p> \n<p>For example, Geltor\u2019s bio-designed marine collagen Collume aids regeneration. It\u2019s made through a sustainable fermentation process.</p> \n<p>Lean into biotech\u2019s efficacious, eco-friendly benefits. Offer informed resources on your website so customers make empowered choices. Stock products with marine ingredients ethically sourced through biotech.</p> \n<h2>Neuro-driven scents</h2> \n<p>Neuroscience-backed scents that affect mood will rise as consumers seek emotional boosts.</p> \n<p>For example, Cosmo Fragrances\u2019 biodegradable scents target specific emotions \u2013 Awakening Citrus uplifts, Recomforting Argan relaxes. Fragrance Oils\u2019 Mood Therapy line features scents to invigorate, inspire positivity, and aid sleep based on nature\u2019s impact on mood.</p> \n<p>As a retailer, offer personalized, mood-specific options to tap into the niche fragrance market. Use neuroscience data like EEG readings to directly inform targeted product development.</p> \n<p>For example, myBrain Technologies uses AI and EEG data to measure emotions triggered by scents. This provides brain data to create effective products.</p> \n<p>With consumers seeking mood boosters, introduce fragrance across all categories \u2013 not just perfumes. Seek out neuroscience partnerships to create scents that provide emotional benefits. Promote products with specific mood-enhancing properties like relaxing or energizing.</p> \n<p>Capture niche demand by allowing shoppers to take a \u201cscent personality quiz\u201d and recommend tailored options. Stress-relieving and uplifting fragrances will strongly resonate in times of uncertainty.</p> \n<h2>Ageing skinnovations</h2> \n<p>Age-supportive ingredients were prominent, with a focus on retaining healthy skin through life stages.</p> \n<p>For example, Lipotrue\u2019s Poptide peptide helps skin stress and wrinkles by improving protein folding. Sustainable collagens from Cambrium and Jland Biotech promote cell proliferation through vegan fermentation.</p> \n<p>As a retailer, promote cellular-level solutions that address biological versus chronological aging. Invest in lab-grown natural ingredients to improve sustainability.</p> \n<p>For example, Altheostem uses plant stem cells and AI to determine the skin\u2019s biological age and demonstrate anti-aging efficacy.</p> \n<p>Shift the narrative from anti-aging to pro-aging. Showcase products with vegan collagens and peptides that provide age-related skin benefits. Offer resources on biological aging and science-backed active ingredients.</p> \n<p>Champion ingredients that embrace the aging process in a holistic way. Avoid fear-based messaging in favor of age diversity and self-care. Provide solutions tailored to life-stage concerns like menopause or hormonal shifts.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The trends from In-cosmetics Global reveal promising opportunities to meet the demand for efficacious and sustainable products. By leveraging upcycling, biotech, neuroscience, and age-focused ingredients in your assortment, you can stand out as a progressive retailer. Monitor these trends closely and use the insights in this article to make smart sourcing and marketing decisions.</p> \n"}]}

Undoubtedly, the best part of any pedicure is when dead skin is taken off the skin, leaving it soft and silky smooth. What better way to do this than to use a quality callus remover?</p> \n<p>However, removing calluses is a delicate process, so businesses must choose effective and quality callus removers to avoid unnecessary pain. This article will uncover the top callus remover trends that will be popular in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat\u2019s the state of the callus remover product market?5 callus remover trends businesses should stock up on in 2024Rounding off</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s the state of the callus remover product market?</h2> \n<p>According to experts, the global callus treatment market will experiencesteady growthat a compound annual growth rate of 4.7% from 2021\u20132028.</p> \n<p>One important factor driving the growth of this market is the health risks calluses can pose, especially for people with diabetes.</p> \n<p>The sports sector also has a part to play in the sprouting market, as athletes, gymnasts, weightlifters, and other sports people who engage in activities that cause friction to their feet often demand callus removal treatments that provide quick and easy results.</p> \n<h2>5 callus remover trends businesses should stock up on in 2024</h2> \n<h3>1. Manual callus removers</h3> \n<p>Manual callus removers, also popularly called footfiles, are small devices made with plastic, silicone, or wooden handles that have textured surfaces such as sandpaper or stainless steel.</p> \n<p>The textured surface is rubbed back and forth against the feet to remove small, simple patches of dead skin from the feet.Theycome in various shapes, colors, and sizes and are compatible with wet or dry feet.</p> \n<p>Manual callus removersare an especially great option for feet with small calluses. However, some come with an additional blade that can be used to slice off an ultra-thick piece of skin.</p> \n<p>While thesecallus removersare easy to use and are the most inexpensive, they are a slower method for getting rid of calluses because the process is done strictly by hand and manpower.</p> \n<p>Foot files have maintained a steady search volume since early 2023. They started at 22,200 in 2022 but boosted to 27,100 in October 2023\u2014a 20% increase in the past year.</p> \n<h3>2. Electric callus removers</h3> \n<p>Electric callus removersrun on either electricity through a cord plugged into direct power or batteries, which could either be non-rechargeable or rechargeable\u2014although the latter is more popular. Rechargeable battery-powered callus removers use a lithium battery that can last anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p> \n<p>In addition, they feature a 360\u00b0rotating roller powerfulenough to rasp and scrub calluses off the feet. They can be used on wet or dry skin but require extra care on wet ones to ensure water doesn\u2019t get into sensitive parts.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Someelectric callus removershave three roller heads with different textures for varying degrees of calluses. They may also come with two or three-speed levels to adjust how fast the roller head moves against the skin.</p> \n<p>Several manufacturers have even taken it a notch higher to include automatic protection designs that stop the roller head when the pressure is too much on the skin, helping to avoid damage to skin.</p> \n<p>Electric callus removersare more expensive than their manual counterparts, but they do a better job in removing larger, thicker, and tougher calluses.</p> \n<p>Although offering a lower performance, electric callus removers are still appealing to an impressive audience volume. According to Google Ads, these products generated 5,400 searches in September 2023, and started October 2023 with 4,400 inquiries.</p> \n<h3>3. Waterproof callus removers</h3> \n<p>Allwaterproof callus removersare electric, but not all electric callus removers are waterproof. It means the former can be used in environments filled with water or cleansed under running water without becoming permanently damaged.</p> \n<p>Waterproof callus removers share many similarities with electric types, including using electricity or batteries as their source of power, having different kinds of roller blades attached, having different speed levels, and coming with a power cord or USB charging cord.</p> \n<p>They also often come with an LED light that helps consumers have a better view of the area they are exfoliating, especially when the foot is submerged in water.</p> \n<p>To elevate its appeal, many of thesecallus removerscome with an additional foot care set, which may include a callus scraper, nail file, nail brush, and much more. They also have a long-lasting battery life, as many can last between 1.5 to 2 hours after charging.</p> \n<p>Waterproof callus removersare easy to use and are a convenient choice for both consumers at home and pedicure salons.</p> \n<h3>4. Callus remover adhesive patch</h3> \n<p>Callus remover adhesivepatches are usually soaked in and medicated with salicylic acid and other chemicals to help remove calluses after being placed on the skin for a certain period.</p> \n<p>Salicylic acid is a keratolytic solution that increases the amount of moisture in the skin and dissolves the substance, causing the skin cells to stick together and become calluses. With the dissolution, it becomes easy for the callused skin to shed.</p> \n<p>It is aconvenient treatmentas it cushions the callus, conceals it, dissolves it, and protects that skin area all at once. Its easy application also makes it a winner amongst consumers.</p> \n<p>Most callusremover adhesive patcheshave a fast-acting formula (usually works in 48 hours). So, it\u2019s a quick and convenient solution for removing dead skin and being safe and effective.</p> \n<p>However, even thoughadhesive patchesare one of the safest methods of callus removal, consumers must be careful not to leave them on longer than prescribed to avoid chemical burns.</p> \n<p>Callusremover adhesive patchesare a very affordable over-the-counter treatment option. They are perfect for busy consumers who don\u2019t have time for pedicure salons and spas.</p> \n<p>Despite their advantages, callus removers only attract a small audience. Google Ads reveals that they will maintain 140 search volume in 2023. However, they increased from 110 in 2022, showing interest in the product is increasing slowly.</p> \n<h3>5. Chemical callus remover</h3> \n<p>Chemical callus removersare usually keratolytic substances. These include lactic acid, urea, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and other ingredients. The removers could combine two or three of the above chemicals alongside other minor ingredients, such as petrolatum, to create gel-based or oil-based products\u2014sometimes combining both.</p> \n<p>Chemical callus removers work in different ways. Some work by applying the product on the skin for 90 minutes before washing away. Otherchemical callus removerswrap the feet overnight and wash off in the morning.</p> \n<p>Others are applied on the feet and left to dry for about an hour or two before requiring consumers to peel them off. Interestingly, somechemical callus removersare poured into thick socks for the user to wear for a short period.</p> \n<p>Regardless of whatever method is used, the result of chemical callus removal is smooth and soft skin. It is important to note that these types ofcallus removerscan not be applied multiple times a day or once every day. They should be used two to three times a week at most because these chemical solutions can remove too much skin if used regularly or left on for too long.</p> \n<p>Moreover, many spas and salons usechemical callus removersbecause they are effective. Although they are not as cheap as adhesive patches, chemical callus removers are quite affordable and often cost less than electric or waterproof callus removers.</p> \n<p>Lately, chemical callus removers have been getting more attention. Based on Google Ads data, the product attracted 70 searches back in June 2023. Fast forward to October, and that number jumped to 110 searches\u2014a solid 40% increase in the past five months!</p> \n<h2>Rounding off</h2> \n<p>Several people worldwide have calluses and are actively seeking ways to improve their skin and boost their self-confidence. With many options to choose from, every consumer can find the callus remover that best suits their needs.</p> \n<p>For instance, consumers with light dead skin patches may opt for manual removers, while those with thicker calluses may find electric and waterproof callus removers more suitable. Users who are always on the move may lean towards adhesive patches, while those with sensitive skin may enjoy the convenience of chemical removers.</p> \n<p>Invest in these callus remover trends to stay ahead of the skin care curve in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

As always, it provided a glimpse into the innovations that will shape the future of cosmetics. Attendees were able to explore the latest ingredient technologies and product concepts. Exhibitors spanned global suppliers wanting to break into new markets. The trends spotted at the show signal opportunities for brands looking to meet evolving consumer demands. At the same time, they highlight areas where more work needs to be done to improve the sustainability and responsibility of the beauty industry. This report summarizes five key trends that forward-thinking brands should have on their radar.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsSkin recovery solutions: New frontier for sensitive skinGentle alt actives meet global complianceMicrobiome-conscious ingredients expandFunctional textures add joy to routinesPhyto-mucins offer vegan snail mucin alternativeFinal thoughts</p> \n<h2>Skin recovery solutions: New frontier for sensitive skin</h2> \n<p>One prominent theme was ingredients that help skin heal and renew itself. The new frontier is finding solutions that activate recovery at the cellular level.</p> \n<p>Some ingredients are being positioned as almost pharmaceutical-grade for how they promote skin\u2019s innate healing processes. For example, an ingredient derived using biomedical tissue engineering techniques typically used for wound healing. Other ingredients home in on the root causes that inhibit skin cell renewal. One extract showcased can regulate cortisol production to enable faster turnover.</p> \n<p>Beyond acne and abrasions, innovations help skin rebound from other stressors. A treatment with yeast extract and ceramides repairs sun damage and soothes inflammation. The potential also exists to speed recovery from aesthetic procedures, razor irritation, and chafing.</p> \n<p>The focus is shifting from just protecting and hydrating skin to giving it the nutrients it needs to renew itself. Brands recognizing this emerging consumer need will gain an edge. Those who can leverage biotech and identify plant actives that provide results without irritation will lead the way.</p> \n<h2>Gentle alt actives meet global compliance</h2> \n<p>Another trend was alternative ingredients that provide results without the irritation that some active ingredients can cause.</p> \n<p>For example, extracts from starfish are emerging as an alternative to retinol. Brands position these as \u201cretinol-mimicking\u201d while being suitable for sensitive skin.</p> \n<p>There are also novel \u201cskin boosters\u201d on the rise. These enhance the effectiveness of active ingredients already in a formula. This allows brands to maintain results while lowering the required dosage.</p> \n<p>To convince consumers to make the swap, sustainability is key. When sourcing from marine life, renewable methods are a must. One supplier returns starfish to the ocean after extracting coelomic fluid. They monitor the ecosystem to prevent overharvesting.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a win-win-win \u2013 consumers get gentler products that work, brands can create formulas that are compliant across global markets, and less stress is put on scarce natural resources.</p> \n<h2>Microbiome-conscious ingredients expand</h2> \n<p>The microbiome remains one of the hottest topics in cosmetics. Brands at the show presented the next generation of skin-balancing prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics.</p> \n<p>Innovation is happening on two fronts. First, more diverse strains of bacteria are being utilized. One company highlighted a humus extract with over 600 inactive microbe species. Another trending microbe is ectoin, which enhances skin\u2019s natural protective barriers.</p> \n<p>Second, microbiome solutions are expanding into new product categories. We\u2019ve seen the boom in probiotic skincare. Now brands are exploring areas like scalp and body care, acne treatments, odor-controlling deodorants, and SPF. One concept even applies prebiotics to feminine care.</p> \n<p>The surface has just been scratched in terms of how cosmetics can harness the power of good bacteria. Brands looking to differentiate in crowded markets would do well to examine how microbiome science can solve specific consumer needs. And identify white space opportunities where this approach hasn\u2019t yet been applied.</p> \n<h2>Functional textures add joy to routines</h2> \n<p>Texture innovation is making routines more enjoyable while boosting product performance.</p> \n<p>New textures provide better delivery of active ingredients. Some use encapsulation methods like liposomes or crystal structures to stabilize volatile compounds. These help potent ingredients remain fresh and effective for longer once applied.</p> \n<p>But textures aren\u2019t just about function. Many brands took inspiration from food to add a whimsical feel. Think icy, melt-in-your-hand creams that morph into an oil. Bouncy caviar-like capsules that burst upon application. Cleansing balms in tropical fruit shapes that transform into a sorbet-textured oil.</p> \n<p>Besides being inherently fun to use, these innovations align with younger generations who see beauty as part of self-care. Brands that can make routines feel less like a chore and more like something to enjoy have an opportunity to connect. Tapping into food trends and nostalgic flavors is an easy way to spark joy.</p> \n<h2>Phyto-mucins offer vegan snail mucin alternative</h2> \n<p>Lastly, natural plant-derived ingredients are offering sustainable alternatives to animal-based compounds.</p> \n<p>For example, mucins from marine algae and vegetables provide similar skin benefits to snail mucin. These natural polymers offer intense hydration, skin recovery, and a silky texture.</p> \n<p>Other plant mucilages come from okra, cactus, and root vegetables. Fermented soybeans yield a sticky substance that helps bind moisture. Even byproducts like guar bean gum, often discarded as waste, can create vegan alternatives.</p> \n<p>Sourcing of these ingredients must be ethical and eco-friendly. Overharvesting wild sources is a risk. Brands can partner with crop growers to utilize excess materials. Upcycling food industry waste into useful cosmetic ingredients keeps materials in circulation.</p> \n<p>Consumers get high-performing products free from animal cruelty concerns. More of nature\u2019s bounty stays in the ecosystem. Using otherwise discardedScraps promotes sustainability. It\u2019s a winning formula for both people and the planet.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>The annual ingredients showcase provided a glimpse into the future of cosmetics. While trends come and go, some key themes around sensitivity, microbiomes, joy, and ethics are likely here to stay.</p> \n<p>Brands would do well to formulate products through the lens of healing sensitive skin. Harnessing good bacteria for targeted benefits has plenty of untapped potential. Small sensory touches make routines delightful versus dutiful. And sustainable sourcing ensures natural ingredient supplies don\u2019t run dry. The passion is there to create next generation cosmetics that are gentle, effective, sustainable and make people smile.</p> \n"}]}

This report outlines the critical trends, from festive fragrances to glittery party looks, that will enable your brand to curate the most in-demand beauty gifts this Christmas. By tapping into Gen Z aesthetics and leaning into nature as design inspiration, you can develop products that not only speak to niche beauty lovers but also align with calls for sustainability. Use this briefing to get ahead of shopper motivations and preferences so your 2024 holiday offerings stand out on shelves.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsGifting outside the beauty normCapturing youthful exuberanceCrafting heirloom luxuriesTaking inspiration from naturePromoting relaxation and wellbeingFinal words</p> \n<h2>Gifting outside the beauty norm</h2> \n<p>This holiday season, beauty brands have an opportunity to think outside the box and offer unexpected, unconventional gift options that appeal to younger niche consumers. A top trend is collaborations between fragrance and food brands to create unique scents inspired by flavors like pastries or matcha. Limited-edition \u201cgourmand\u201d perfumes in provocative, bold packaging will capture attention as collector\u2019s items.</p> \n<p>Kits that encourage customization and self-expression also enable consumers to put their own twist on a product. A current example is tooth gems \u2013 temporary jewels in varied shapes, sizes and colors to adhere to teeth. Giving recipients the tools to quickly switch up their look feeds into the desire for novelty.</p> \n<p>In terms of color, it\u2019s time to move beyond only red and green holiday palettes. Gen Z especially will flock to neons, pastels, and vibrant hues that communicate avant-garde subversion. Semi-permanent hair dyes in unconventional colors like blue or purple are a prime example.</p> \n<p>Foot masks in black, glittery finishes and other non-traditional formats upgrade a self-care ritual into something exotic and gift-worthy. The key is recognizing the diversity of niche beauty lovers who want to be surprised and even challenged during the holidays. Brands that embrace bold aesthetics and offbeat innovations will capture the attention of these consumers seeking items that help them uniquely express themselves.</p> \n<h2>Capturing youthful exuberance</h2> \n<p>The holiday season presents an opportunity for younger consumers to get playful with eye-catching beauty looks. Gen Zers and Millennials are embracing the chance to experiment with everything from glittery eyeshadows to pastel hair dyes. These groups see holiday parties and events as a chance to break outside their everyday beauty routines.</p> \n<p>To appeal to these fun-loving consumers, brands can curate limited-edition sets that encourage colorful experimentation. Multi-use brights and metallic shades in both cool and warm palettes allow for mix-and-match makeup looks. Combining the smoky eye trend with unexpected pops of berry or emerald green offers a fresh take. When it comes to lips, gloss is making a comeback for high-shine and non-sticky wear. Texture is also key \u2013 the bolder, the better. Glitters and 3D appliqu\u00e9s let consumers add rave-inspired sparkle.</p> \n<p>For even more temporary effects, semi-permanent hair dyes in vibrant winter pastels are ideal for achieving a unique holiday hair look that washes out afterwards. And sustainable biodegradable glitters now allow for dazzling embellishments without harming the environment.</p> \n<p>In today\u2019s social media-fueled culture, Gen Z and Millennials are all about capturing the party moment. By offering playful products that provide eye-catching results, brands can align with the adventurous and experimental beauty spirit of these younger consumers.</p> \n<h2>Crafting heirloom luxuries</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s consumers want beauty gifts that feel special, last beyond the holidays, and become valued objects to display and enjoy. Brands can deliver modern heirlooms by emphasizing quality craftsmanship and materials along with a compelling brand narrative.</p> \n<p>Luxury components like engraved metals, sustainable exotic woods, and hand-blown glass impart a sense of enduring value. Packaging details such as embossing, intricate patterns, and weighty caps further elevate the unboxing experience. But well-designed aesthetics should align with functionality. Multi-purpose products that transition beautifully into domestic spaces encourage retention and daily use.</p> \n<p>The heritage behind formulations also tells a compelling story. Highlighting traditional ingredients and production methods connects consumers to generations past. Examples are Korean beauty products featuring medicinal herbs and French skincare showcasing botanicals used since the 17th century.</p> \n<p>Brands can strike a balance between affordability and lasting luxury by offering artisanal gift sets at accessible price points. Curating a mix of full sizes and minis caters to a range of budgets. The focus should be on creating a wow factor that makes the recipient feel special. Fewer, well-chosen items encourage retention over disposal.</p> \n<p>With some creative thinking, beauty brands can craft gifts that feel like modern treasures. The unboxing experience then becomes an opportunity to form an emotional connection that lasts beyond the holidays.</p> \n<h2>Taking inspiration from nature</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s eco-conscious consumers want beauty gifts and packaging that connect them to nature without harming the planet. Brands can take inspiration from the outdoors to appeal to this market.</p> \n<p>Sourcing renewable, organic materials like bamboo, pulp paper, and pine visually and tactically references nature\u2019s biodiversity. Gentle, earthy color palettes drawn from forest floors and oceanscapes further cultivate a soothing biophilic quality.</p> \n<p>In terms of packaging design, brands should incorporate natural materials and prints without excessive decorative elements. Multi-functional boxes like reusable metal tins and compostable containers are better than single-use wrappers.</p> \n<p>Help shoppers give zero-waste gifts by curating beauty and bath sets featuring natural skincare and body products in compostable packaging. Kits that contain enough product for a pampering self-care ritual make great presents.</p> \n<p>Brands should also communicate about their own sustainable practices to attract eco-conscious consumers. Using responsible suppliers, renewable energies, and carbon-offsetting shows commitment to reducing environmental impact.</p> \n<p>The key is providing biophilic gifts that spark joy and appreciation for nature while minimizing harm. Small touches like biodegradable confetti and plantable seed paper for wrapping cultivate mindfulness for the planet. With some creativity, beauty brands can make greener gifting easy and appealing.</p> \n<h2>Promoting relaxation and wellbeing</h2> \n<p>With stress and anxiety still rampant, gifts that promote relaxation and self-care will resonate next holiday season. Curated sets that contain products to help recipients de-stress make thoughtful presents.</p> \n<p>Soothing scents like lavender and eucalyptus can come in the form of candles, bath salts, body lotions. Cooling eye masks, hydrating lip treatments, and massage tools further enable pampering experiences.</p> \n<p>Brands should also leverage sensory elements like calming colors, soft lighting, and tranquil soundscapes to cultivate the atmosphere of wellbeing. Affirmation cards and mantras remind recipients to pause and focus on mental health.</p> \n<p>Consumers want efficiency in their self-care routines. Multifunctional products that streamline regimens will be appreciated. Examples are 2-in-1 cleansing balms that remove makeup while moisturizing and body oils that also work as fragrance.</p> \n<p>With self-gifting on the rise, sets tailored for men will also resonate \u2013 from smoothing shave creams to hand creams that relieve dryness from frequent washing.</p> \n<p>The key is crafting gifts that provide recipients with tools to build rituals that comfort and restore. Thoughtful present-giving this season means understanding the ongoing need for stability, healing, and emotional support.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>The 2024 holiday season is the time to think outside the gift box. Consumers want to be surprised and delighted by presents that rebel against tradition, capture youthful fun, promote luxury and nature, and support self-care. Ensure the choice aligns with these key trends so young people see the brand as a go-to destination for innovative, eco-friendly, and relevant beauty gifts. Capture Gen Z\u2019s vivid aesthetic on social media while sharing how the products provide ritual, relaxation, and joy. The holidays are about more than getting through \u2013 they are moments to inspire and uplift.</p> \n"}]}

Hence, businesses can\u2019t follow a one-size-fits-all approach to offering eyelash tweezers.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, this article will serve as a guide to show businesses the different types of eyelash tweezers and what they should look out for in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the eyelash tweezer market3 types of eyelash tweezers in the marketWhat to consider when choosing eyelash tweezersWrapping up</p> \n<h2>An overview of the eyelash tweezer market</h2> \n<p>Eyelash tweezers are part of thebeauty tools market, which experts project will surpass US$ 97 billion by 2025. They also predict it\u2019ll grow at a speedy 17.40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of their physical appearance in 2023. Coupled with the increasing desire to look healthy, attractive, and young, these factors boost demand for beauty tools, including tweezers.</p> \n<p>Experts suggest North America will hold its dominant market position over the forecast period. However, Europe is following closely behind with enough momentum to dominate the leading market.</p> \n<h2>3 types of eyelash tweezers in the market</h2> \n<h3>Isolation tweezers</h3> \n<p>Consumers can\u2019t have gorgeous and durablelasheswithout isolating them properly. In fact, not isolating eyelash extensions correctly can lead to various problems, including lashes falling off faster than expected or making wearers uncomfortable. However,isolation tweezersare here to solve these issues.</p> \n<p>These multifunctional tools are perfect for applying eyelash extensions and isolating natural lashes. Isolation tweezers have special, fine-tipped shapes, making it easy to separate and isolate individual natural lashes without pushing glue on other lashes.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s great for quickening the process and preventing glued lash clumps from forming under the eye area or on the eyelid. More importantly,isolation tweezersoffer various shapes and sizes, coming in models that may be curved at the end or straight. Lash artists will also choose between the two depending on which one gives them more control.</p> \n<p>Curvyisolation tweezersoffer more freedom of movement, allowing consumers to securely hold pesky baby lashes that often poke from the bunch. On the other hand, straight isolation is less beginner-friendly since they\u2019re trickier to get used to\u2014but lash stylists still love them.</p> \n<p>Interest in isolation tweezers has been consistent in the past year. According to reports from Google Ads, the beauty product attracts a steady 720 searches monthly, even in October 2023.</p> \n<h3>Classic tweezers</h3> \n<p>Isolation tweezers are just one part of a set. Consumers can pair them up with others to easily pick up and apply different lash extensions. As a result,classic tweezersare also a popular choice for every lash stylist.</p> \n<p>Classic tweezersare a beauty staple\u2014and they use a simple technique, too. Consumers only need to attach a lash extension to its natural counterpart. While this simple approach means having a different tweezer for classic extensions is not compulsory, some options will make this process easier, making them a great choice.</p> \n<p>For instance, qualitystraight tweezerscan easily create an everlasting classic style. Since classic extension lashes are the thickest, they don\u2019t need the extra fine tips of isolation tweezers to pick up and install.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Consumers uncomfortable withstraight tweezerscan opt for ones with a more defined finish.</p> \n<p>Classic tweezers are quite the hit commodity according to Google Ads data. On average, they\u2019re getting around 6600 searches every month. What\u2019s even more intriguing is that they\u2019ve kept up this search trend all the way to October 2023 after increasing from 5400 in November 2022.</p> \n<p>It might not be a massive number, but it\u2019s a steady and impressive performance!</p> \n<h3>Volume tweezers</h3> \n<p>Volume lash tweezersare different from other styles. They need a very specific pair of tweezers to look glorious, so straight tweezers aren\u2019t the best options for them. But why do they need specific tweezers?</p> \n<p>Well, lash stylists can create looks withvolume lash extensionsby applying different falsies on a single natural lash. So, creating the perfect shape that will stick to the lash effortlessly requires the specific design of volume tweezers.</p> \n<p>Volume tweezersare long, featuring a curve or twist at the tip. The best types for creating the perfect dramatic look are L-shaped and J-shaped tweezers.</p> \n<p>L-shaped tweezers can grab larger lash extensions simultaneously and create narrower fan shapes. As a result, many consumers preferL-shaped tweezersfor mega-volume lashes, which involve looks with 20 individual extensions.</p> \n<p>In contrast, consumers preferJ-curved volumetweezers for fluffy and wide styles involving 5-6 individual lashes.</p> \n<p>In 2023, volume tweezers are making quite a splash. They\u2019ve jumped from 1300 in 2022 to 1600 in 2023 (January to October). A small but significant surge in interest.</p> \n<h2>What to consider when choosing eyelash tweezers</h2> \n<h3>Tip shape</h3> \n<p>Tips are the most important parts of professional eyelash extension tweezers. They\u2019re responsible for picking, selecting, and separating eyelashes during the procedure.</p> \n<p>More importantly, tweezers have different tip types, each serving a specific function. Here\u2019s a table showcasing all the available tip types and what they\u2019re ideal for.</p> \n<p>Note: L-shaped and J-shaped tweezers are also available, but they\u2019ve been discussed under \u201cvolume tweezers.\u201d</p> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers often craft professional eyelash extension tweezers from stainless and titanium. Although stainless tweezers have high rust resistance, they may still rust if users don\u2019t look after them. Stainless tweezers may also have small amounts of nickel and may cause some people to react.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, titanium tweezers offer lighter and rust-free designs. Plus, it\u2019s a strong and springy material, making it the perfect fit for professional eyelash extension tweezers. Since it is also allergy-free, titanium tweezers are compatible with medical procedures.</p> \n<p>Carbon fiber and plastic are less common materials manufacturers use to make eyelash tweezers. They\u2019re both less durable than their stainless and titanium counterparts, with carbon fiber being more difficult to find.</p> \n<h3>Magnetic or non-magnetic</h3> \n<p>Most eyelash tweezers are either magnetic or non-magnetic, each with unique benefits. Magnetic tweezers have a built-in magnetic tip or feature to hold and manipulate magnetic eyelash extensions.</p> \n<p>Usually, magnetic eyelash extensions have tiny magnets attached, allowing the tweezers to secure them. However, magnetic tweezers are specific to these eyelash extensions and may not offer the best experience with other types.</p> \n<p>In contrast, non-magnetic tweezers are the exact opposite. They don\u2019t have any magnetism and are more versatile, allowing consumers to use them for classic, volume, or hybrid lash applications.</p> \n<p>More importantly, they offer more control and precision in separating, isolating, and placing individual lashes.</p> \n<h3>Grip and weight</h3> \n<p>Although often overlooked, grip and weight are important factors impacting the users\u2019 finger joints, wrist, and overall posture. Hence, it\u2019s necessary to look out for tweezers with the correct tightness and weight for the consumer\u2019s hand.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s a table showing the different eyelash tweezer grips and weights and their ideal consumers.</p> \n<h3>Length</h3> \n<p>The perfect eyelash tweezer length would not be too long or too short in the consumer\u2019s hands. However, it mostly depends on the user\u2019s hand size and pick-up style. So, check out the table below to see the best length for different types of consumers.</p> \n<h3>Tension</h3> \n<p>When choosing a pair, aim for tweezers with an appropriate tension balance\u2014enough to grasp individual lashes securely with an easy release. Ensure the tension is not overly strong, as consumers won\u2019t want to exert excessive effort when using them.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Stocking up on eyelash tweezers requires considering numerous factors including: size, weight, tip shape, length, and even tension. It\u2019s no secret that the market offers various options, but the choice ultimately rests with the buyer.</p> \n<p>What suits one lash artist perfectly may prove highly inconvenient for another. However, this article provides enough information to help businesses decide the best offers for their consumers, and it allows them to cater to a range of needs.</p> \n"}]}

Monofilament wig caps</h3> \n<p>Monofilament wig capshave unique designs that create the illusion of hair growing naturally from the scalp. Manufacturers craft these wig caps from sheer polyester or soft nylon mesh, with each hair painstakingly hand-tied in place.</p> \n<p>These caps are strategically positioned at the top or crown to reveal the skin tone, giving the wig a realistic scalp look and allowing the hair to move naturally. Although these two types ofmonofilament wig capsoffer the same benefit, they do it in different ways.</p> \n<p>For instance, amono crownmakes it appear like hair is growing around the crown, while a mono top covers the entire top area of the head, making it look like it\u2019s growing directly out of the scalp.</p> \n<p>Additionally, mono crowns allow more room for the head to breathe since its construction only requires onemesh layer. On the other hand, mono tops come with double-knotted mesh, which, although heavier, promotes a warmer feeling. Plus, mono tops also offer more styling and parting options than their crown counterparts.</p> \n<p>Monofilament wig caps are not very popular but still hold some attention. According to Google Ads, these products average 170 searches in October, a 2% increase from September\u2019s 140 inquiries.</p> \n<h3>2. Basic wig caps</h3> \n<p>Basic wig caps,or the capless or traditional caps, are the most common. Their construction requires machines to sew wefts into a strip of thin elastic material, resulting in a fast production rate. No wonder they are the most common and inexpensive types.</p> \n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re low-quality products. In fact, the crown of thewig cappossesses a solid lace top, while its edge and rear feature durable wefts. Interestingly, this construction allows air to flow directly to the wearer\u2019s scalp, providing a more comfy fit.</p> \n<p>Usually, wigs withbasic wig capshave a fuller volume due to shorter hair fibers concealing the weft rows. However, some basic wig caps are \u201cthin wefted,\u201d featuring a fine stretchable material that reduces the volume and molds to the contours of the wearer\u2019s head for a customized fit.</p> \n<p>Most wigs made withbasic wig capsusually require low maintenance. Why? They are ready-to-wear with minimal or no styling needed. But these wig caps are limited and not versatile.</p> \n<p>Basic wig caps are the most popular and Google Ads proves it. According to its data, wig caps command 40,500 searches monthly. The best part is they\u2019ve maintained these numbers since 2022.</p> \n<h3>3.

It features a hand-knotted, sheer material, which becomes almost invisible when placed on the wearer\u2019s scalp. This design allows consumers to style them away from the face and even put the wig in a low ponytail or bun.</p> \n<p>Because thesewig capsare made by adding lace fronts to a basic wig cap construction, they are a great choice for consumers who need something breathable and are worried about keeping cool throughout the day. However, the process of hand sewing additional material to them makes the lace front wig cap cost much more than a basic wig cap.</p> \n<p>Generally,lace front wig capsare delicate materials that require careful handling. Otherwise, they will have a short lifespan. Furthermore, they loosen with use but can fortunately be repaired by professional hairstylists.</p> \n<p>Overall, lace front wig caps are a confidence booster for consumers with receding hairlines. Google Ads data reveals that they\u2019ve attracted a small but considerable search volume in 2023, averaging at 720 inquiries monthly.</p> \n<h3>4. Hand-crafted wig caps</h3> \n<p>Regarding hair luxury,hand-crafted wig capsare at the top of the list. As the name implies, the wig cap is designed with handmade craftsmanship, where each strand of hair is hand-knotted on a soft mesh surface.</p> \n<p>Comfort, style, and flexibility are the most appreciable features of thesewig capsbecause they have no seams or wefts, making them feel incredibly soft against the scalp and perfect for consumers with sensitive scalps. They are highly breathable and allow for the scalp to remain well-ventilated.</p> \n<p>Wigs made withhand-crafted capscan take as much as three days to construct to achieve realistic movement of the hair and versatile styling. A 100% hand-crafted cap looks and moves like natural hair.Because of how intensive this process is,hand-crafted wig capsare the most expensive of all wig caps. Many hand-crafted wig caps are also lace front caps, which loosen up over time. A stylist can however tighten them, but they\u2019ll need delicate care to prevent unnecessary damage.</p> \n<p>According to data from Google Ads, hand-crafted wig caps target a niche market with an average of 50 monthly searches. However, searches for them have gone up to 70 in October 2023.</p> \n<h3>5. Mono-top lace front caps</h3> \n<p>Mono-top lace front capscombine all the attributes of a mono-top cap with a deep lace front cap, providing utmost comfort, versatility, and an invisible hairline.</p> \n<p>Thesewig capsare created using a single or double layer of monofilament material at the top of the wig and a lace front at the front hairline of the wig. It allows the wig to be styled in any part and also be able to sleek back in a ponytail or bun.</p> \n<p>When a double layer ofmonofilamentis used, the second layer is attached to the knotted under-layer, which creates a smoother feel against the scalp and reduces scalp irritation from hand-tied knots.</p> \n<p>As per Google Ads data, mono-top lace front caps receive an average of 70 monthly searches. Interestingly, search interest peaked at 110 in October 2023, indicating a modest level of interest within a niche audience.</p> \n<h2>Closing words</h2> \n<p>Wig caps are quintessential for wigs that make consumers feel poise, elegant, comfortable, and self-confident all day. Their wide variety allows consumers to make their choices on what fits their style best while remaining within their budget.</p> \n<p>Wigs and their caps don\u2019t seem to be going away anytime soon, so consider investing in monofilament, basic, lace front, hand-tied, and mono-top lace front wig caps.

These rollers can save valuable time by speeding up the curling process and help minimize heat-related hair damage risks.</p> \n<p>However,hot hair rollersare not the most travel-friendly option. Since they require a heat source at work, it may be challenging to use them while on the go. And even though they\u2019re safe, extensive use may cause potential damage, especially without proper heat protection.</p> \n<p>Data from Google Ads shows that the hot rollers got an average monthly search of 49500 in September 2023, rising from 33100 in August at a 6% increase.</p> \n<h3>Flexi-rods</h3> \n<p>Flexi-rodsare bendable rollers crafted from materials like foam or silicone. They easily bend and twist into the hair, allowing users to create endless curl patterns, each with a unique size and flair.</p> \n<p>While flexi-rods offer versatility, the curls they create may not always be as defined or long-lasting as desired, which some consumers consider a deal breaker.Flexi-rodsmay also cost users extra time, especially when they must roll and secure each section of their hair.</p> \n<p>Regardless, due to their low cost, flexi-rods are still a top choice for consumers.

They require regular maintenance, including cleaning, to remain effective over time.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, ladies can experiment with different styles risk-free. For instance, they can use smallsponge rollersto style tight ringlets. Or they can create bouncy, voluminous curls with larger sponge rollers.</p> \n<p>Consumers searched for \u201csponge rollers\u201d 8100 times on Google in September 2023, based on the Ads report, meaning they experienced an 8% increase from 6600 search queries in June 2023.</p> \n<h3>Magnetic rollers</h3> \n<p>Magnetic hair rollersare a straightforward, accessory-free solution for consumers tired of grappling with traditional hair rollers. Though magnetic rollers don\u2019t have \u201cmagnetic\u201d designs, they securely grip wet hair, like magnets attracting iron, eliminating the need for pins, clips, or extra tools.</p> \n<p>Contrary to their names, manufacturers makemagnetic rollersentirely out of plastic. So, instead of magnetic shenanigans, they feature ventilation holes to keep wet hair secure without worrying about heat damage.</p> \n<p>For this reason, women can enjoy a streamlined styling process without packing multiple accessories to keep their wet hair sturdy.

They\u2019re not the best for creating curls, but Velcro rollers outshine their counterparts when maintaining the hair\u2019s body and volume.</p> \n<p>Velcro rollersboast remarkable adaptability, which really sets them apart. Regardless of the hair type, whether straight, wavy, or curly, these rollers effortlessly accommodate consumer needs, enabling them to craft the perfect hairstyle with absolute ease.</p> \n<p>However,velcro rollersmay not be the gentlest option for thin hair.

They have many benefits, making them attractive in 2023, particularly with women exposed to various social media posts and videos showcasing breathtaking hairstyles.</p> \n<p>Whether consumers have limp, fine, or long hair, there\u2019s a roller for everyone. However, the top trends for businesses to leverage are velcro, hot, magnetic, foam, sponge, and flexi-rod hair rollers. Dive into these trends to capitalize on the profit potential of hair rollers in 2023.</p> \n"}]}

But while many women like doing their nails, it\u2019s often not easy to maintain them. That\u2019s why they turn to nail lamps, which can help provide long-lasting and chip-resistant nails, making them an irreplaceable tool in the arsenal of at-home or in-salon manicures.</p> \n<p>The market is largely divided into two types ofnaillamps: UV or LED. This article will delve into the pros and cons of each to determine which makes the better investment in 2023.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsNail lamp market overview in 2023UV vs. LED nail lamps: What are the differences?Other factors to considerSo, which is the better investment?Conclusion</p> \n<h2>Nail lamp market overview in 2023</h2> \n<p>In 2022, thenail lamp global marketwas estimated to be worth US $46.4 billion, and at its current rate, estimates predict that the market will grow by US $66.1 billion by 2031. Nail lamps are popular for their ability to maintain nails, as well as their accessibility, making them a high-demand commodity in the beauty industry.</p> \n<p>Social media trends also significantly influence the market\u2019s growth, with DIY videos and posts highlighting their beautifully neat manicures further increasing their desire for manicure tools.</p> \n<h2>UV vs. LED nail lamps: What are the differences?</h2> \n<p>UV andLED nail lampsare used to dry and cure gel nail polish. Interestingly, both types use UV light to work, so it may initially seem that there\u2019s not much difference between them.</p> \n<p>However, that\u2019s not the case. Each different functionalities that make one preferable depending on the task at hand. These include:</p> \n<h3>UV wavelengths</h3> \n<p>As mentioned previously,UVand LED lamps both use UV to set artificial nails. They do so by initiating a polymerization chemical process, transforming liquid gel into something durable and solid.</p> \n<p>However, depending on which type of lamp you use, that\u2019s where the similarities end.. For example,UV nail lampsemit a stronger and broader wavelength spectrum, whileLED variantsgenerate narrower, more targeted wavelengths. Consequently, the LED lamp\u2019s narrower wavelengths tend to provide better curing than their UV counterparts.</p> \n<h3>Curing duration</h3> \n<p>Curing duration is another significant factor that differentiates UV andLED nail lamps, with the latter generally working quicker than the former. However, actual curing duration will largely depend on the lamp model.</p> \n<p>LED nail lamps tend to work faster because they use a narrow light spectrum, curing nails in 30-60 seconds. On the other hand, theUV nail lamp\u2019sbroader range makes for a curing process of 2-3 minutes, approximately.</p> \n<h3>Lifespan</h3> \n<p>Both UV and LED nail lamps require bulbs to emit their wavelengths, and each offers a different bulb lifespan.</p> \n<p>Usually,UV lamp bulbscan generate 1,000 hours of light, needing to be replaced every three months.</p> \n<p>Contrarily,LED nail lamp lightstend to live longer, with their bulbs lasting up to 50,000 hours. To put this into perspective, if consumers use the lamp for 12 hours a day, they wouldn\u2019t need to replace the bulb for 11 years.</p> \n<h3>Wattage</h3> \n<p>Both UV and LED nail lamps require specific wattage to perform properly. Specialists indicate that any lamp using lower than 10 watts won\u2019t perform well. So, what\u2019s the ideal wattage for each lamp?</p> \n<p>ManyUV lampscome with adjustable wattage levels, allowing umers to choose anywhere from 36-72 watts. MostLED nail lampsoffer something similar, but can be adjusted between 24-48 watts since they require less wattage.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the wattage settings, UV nail lamps will always take longer to cure, while high-wattage LED variants can make the process faster.</p> \n<h3>Safety</h3> \n<p>UV andLED nail lampsuse wavelengths that mimic the sun\u2019s rays, meaning that most dermatologists advise against prolonged exposure.</p> \n<p>However, the FDA sets nail lamps as low-risk devices, meaning there\u2019s a very low chance of them being as harmful as the sun. However, if consumers are still concerned about safety, they may want to chooseLED nail lampsover their UV counterparts.</p> \n<h2>Other factors to considerPolish types</h2> \n<p>The nail polish consumers use will mostly determine the kind of nail lamp that they\u2019ll buy. That\u2019s because nail lamps only work on gel nail polish \u2013 using them for other types of polish won\u2019t produce the desired results.</p> \n<p>But it gets even more specific.LED nail lampswill only cure specific gel polishes, which are produced specifically to have high compatibility with LED lights.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile,UV nail lampsare compatible with a wider range of gel polish, including LED-specific varieties. For this reason, they give consumers more flexibility in choosing what type of nail polish they wish to use.</p> \n<h3>Weight and size</h3> \n<p>Usually, UV and LED nail lamps are light enough for beauticians to carry between jobs. However,LED nail lampsare often lighter than theirUV counterparts.</p> \n<p>LED nail lamps also come in smaller designs, making them even more lightweight. While UV lamps tend to be\u00a0 slightly larger and heavier, the difference is quite negligible.</p> \n<h3>Cost</h3> \n<p>LED lamps are more expensive than UV lamps upfront, but they can help save costs in the long run in thatLED nail lampshave longer bulb lifespans and consume less energy.</p> \n<p>AlthoughUV lampsare more affordable, they\u2019ll cost more to maintain given that the bulbs need more frequent replacements.</p> \n<p>However, increased demand for LED nail lamps and improved technology has meant that they\u2019ve become gradually more affordable.</p> \n<h3>Power usage</h3> \n<p>A nail lamp\u2019s power consumption depends on its wattage rating. Higher wattages may result in faster curing but they also increase energy consumption. Nevertheless,UV nail lamps, with their higher wattage ratings, consume more power than LED lamps overall.</p> \n<h2>So, which is the better investment?</h2> \n<p>UV and LED nail lamps achieve the same purpose, so choosing the best lamp for you will depend on the outlet and their consumer base while also taking into consideration the factors highlighted above.</p> \n<p>Mobile nail technicians who travel frequently may gravitate toward LED nail lamps given that they\u2019re compact and lighter. Usually, portability and longevity are a significant determining factor among these consumers.</p> \n<p>However, businesses targeting bigger nail salons will see UV lamps as a better investment as these often attend to multiple customers daily, thus requiring the speed and flexibility with nail polishes that UV nail lamps provide.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>UV nail lamps and LED nail lamps play a salient part in the ever-growing nail and beauty industry, and given that gel nail polishes are not going out of style soon, UV and LED nail lamps are here for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>Therefore, now is a great time to research the nail lamp market, and both lamps make a worthy investment. The key is to know which variety resonates best with their target audience, allowing them to tailor their offerings for more sales in 2023.If you\u2019re looking for inspiration or thousands of options just like the ones above, visitwww.Alibaba.comtoday.</p> \n"}]}

Men seek products that cater to their genuine needs without reinforcing outdated gender norms. Businesses must foster inclusivity, challenge stereotypes, and actively engage in meaningful conversations surrounding self-care and masculinity.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, self-care trends among men indicate a positive cultural shift, encouraging them to prioritize their well-being and mental health. Whether its through the adoption of a comprehensive skincare routine, engaging in mindfulness practices, or embracing grooming rituals, men are embracing self-care as an essential aspect of a balanced and fulfilling life.</p> \n<p>Moving forward, businesses and individuals must recognize that self-care knows no gender boundaries.

This is why the makeup industry is expected to undergo many changes by 2026.</p> \n<p>These newmakeup trendswill cover more than the preferred makeup products. Consumers want brands to introduce more technology in makeup application, fitting those with disabilities and other needs.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s the future of the beauty market in 2026 and how businesses can prepare.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of 2026 makeup trends2026 makeup trendsConclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of 2026 makeup trends</h2> \n<p>The beauty industry isn\u2019t slowing down. According to a research report, thecosmetics industry\u2019s compound annual growth rate will be 5.25% between 2023 and 2029.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, the modern makeup enthusiast is very different than one from years past. And Gen Zers represent the biggest part of the consumer base, as theircurrent makeup spendingis already at pre-pandemic levels.</p> \n<p>The core trends in makeup will be different than they were before. Gen Zers are dismantling beauty standards, embracing flaws, and developing a realistic perception of beauty. Because of this, makeup is now used as an artistic expression and not to improve one\u2019s appearance.</p> \n<p>They also have strict standards for brands. Younger consumers prioritize companies that meet their sustainability needs.</p> \n<p>With a growing demand for technology, the average consumer expects high-tech solutions from their favorite makeup brands. These vary between VR- and AR-based products and technological tools for disabled individuals.</p> \n<h2>2026 makeup trends</h2> \n<p>The 2026 makeup trends vary from technology-fueled makeup tools to all-in-one makeup products. These trends reflect the socio-political global market, rejection of conventional beauty standards, prioritization of artistic expression, technological innovations, and growing awareness of sustainability.</p> \n<h3>Makeup hybrids</h3> \n<p>Now that we\u2019re back to pre-pandemic times, the average global beauty user is ready to take over the world. With workers now settled back at work, hustle culture is in full effect.</p> \n<p>But since beauty consumers have a full schedule, they demand all-in-one makeup and skin care products to expedite their makeup routine.</p> \n<p>An example is afoundation formulated with skincare ingredients. Users are working late to compensate for high inflation and funds lost during the pandemic, and they will need to keep their skin hydrated and glowing for all-day wear.</p> \n<p>Consumers will also need easy day-to-night beauty solutions for office parties and conferences after work.Two-in-one cheek and lip color productscan satisfy this demand; all users need to do is keep one product in their bag to add a splash of color to their office look.</p> \n<p>Since life is back to normal, more users are also traveling. They will need to keep travel-friendly and easy-to-use products on hand during their adventures.</p> \n<p>Atwo-in-one mascara wandis a perfect example; this product features a fluffy spoolie for the upper lashes and a thin brush for the bottom, so users can quickly apply mascara while waiting for their flight.</p> \n<h3>Reclaiming beauty standards</h3> \n<p>Users are done with unattainable appearances exacerbated by social media and are rejecting the beauty standards of the past. In thepersonal careindustry, the average makeup user will trade a polished appearance for expressive and unconventional looks.</p> \n<p>Since the 80s\u2019 and 90s\u2019 global beauty trends are re-emerging, your business should focus on sellingblush. Unconventional colors, such as blue and purple, add more personalization to fun makeup looks.</p> \n<p>Users will also embrace art to show off their individuality.Face gemswill make users stand out and push the boundaries of art in cosmetics.</p> \n<h3>Adaptive technology</h3> \n<p>With inclusivity as one of the biggest trends, your client base will demand adaptive technology in the personal care market. We\u2019re already seeing this with machine learning makeup and virtual try-on technology, but there are other ways that cosmetics brands can target marginalized communities.</p> \n<p>Research shows that, in North America, 1 in 4 adults live with a disability. And for many individuals, this disability can affect hand, wrist, and finger movements. This makes makeup application a major challenge for disabled consumers.</p> \n<p>Advances in computerized application tools are an example of mobility tech that brands can make available to these consumers.</p> \n<p>The popularity of beauty apps also presents a new opportunity to engage with the blind community.</p> \n<p>In the United States, over 12 million people over the age of 40 have avisual impairment. Voice-enabled makeup aids can help blind individuals apply their makeup independently, and the app can inform them where they made a mistake and offer other advice.</p> \n<p>This does present a challenge for brands. High-tech is expensive, and consumers will still demand affordable products and accessible technology. There are other makeup tech products available at a lower price, such asfalse lash applicators.</p> \n<h3>Advanced color science</h3> \n<p>Key trends in color are changing. Instead of one trending color, consumers in 2026 will choose shades that complement their unique skin tones and undertones.</p> \n<p>This will welcome more experimentation. Since this is an upward trend, brands should sell eyeshadows incream formulas, so users have an easier time combining and mixing shades.</p> \n<p>This also extends to cheek and lip products. Instead of selling products in a compact, choosetube formulaswhere users can dab different colors on their skin, blending them in to create their perfect shade.</p> \n<p>Instead of covering imperfections, the average consumer will use the color wheel to neutralize hyperpigmentation. The average user will throw out traditional foundations and replace them withCC creamsthat target redness and other pigmentation issues.</p> \n<h3>Conscious brands</h3> \n<p>Consciousness will continue to be one of the key Gen Zbeauty trends. According to the latest customer data,88% of peopleare more loyal to brands that support environmental and social issues.</p> \n<p>How can your company be more inclusive and accepting? Offer makeup made ofclean and organicbeauty products to target consumers with sensitive skin.</p> \n<p>For consumers of different races, ensure yourfoundationsand powders fit all skin colors and undertones. Use conscious and recyclable packaging so users won\u2019t feel guilty about throwing out empty makeup containers. Or, offer refillable packaging to reduce waste.</p> \n<p>Brands should also exercise transparency during the entire buying process. Online stores can keep detailed information on your product sourcing and supply chain process available on your website. Consider receiving certifications that prove you follow fair labor and eco-friendly regulations.</p> \n<h3>Improved makeup tools</h3> \n<p>In 2026, makeup tools will be a key beauty focus. Brands are expecting to redesign makeup tools to meet the rising demand for ergonomics and enhance creative expression.</p> \n<p>For example, spatulas are expected to replace brushes. They\u2019re more versatile, and users can apply different products with one spatula. Users can also buya set of spatulasto push the boundaries of makeup application. Spatulas are also easy to clean and last longer than brushes.</p> \n<p>Users will also ask companies to use different materials in their makeup applicators. For example,stainless steelis antibacterial and hypoallergenic, better for users with a sensitive skin type.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In 2026, Gen Z consumers will become the most influential players in the cosmetic products market. With their busy schedules, they demand hybrid products, customizable colors, and improved makeup tools.</p> \n<p>Beauty consumers are also rejecting beauty standards and embracing inclusivity, especially for the disabled community. Consumers will still ask brands to stay conscious of various social and environmental issues.</p> \n<p>Beauty brands should know which trends to expect in the coming years to appeal to consumer demands.

The vast industry has to deal with problems resulting from wasteful distribution, environmentally harmful formulations, and finding the right ingredients for beauty products.</p> \n<p>Through circular beauty, companies can reduce carbon emissions while still generating profits in a way that benefits the environment. How is this possible in a lucrative but competitive industry while dodging the traditional linear economy business model? This article will dive into 5 key circularbeauty opportunitiesbusinesses can utilize to meet customer demands.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsCircular beauty products market5 key circular beauty product opportunitiesConclusion</p> \n<h2>Circular beauty products market</h2> \n<p>The global circular beauty products industry recorded a market valuation ofUSD 2.4 billionin 2022. By the end of 2032, the market is projected to reach USD 4.2 billion, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%.</p> \n<p>This huge growth comes from the increased awareness among beauty brands on the global consumption of products and their environmental impact. As a result, they are becoming eco-warriors and adopting the circular economy to produce carbon-neutral beauty products.</p> \n<p>Moreover, companies are developing sustainable products from waste from olive oil, citrus extract, and coffee beans. This results in renewableproduct packagingand reducing the reliance on animal-based products.</p> \n<p>The ever-evolving beauty trends are another factor leading to the growth in the circular beauty products market size. Strict government policies in some countries have also encouraged the production of zero-waste products. This has resulted in high demand for these products, with76% of consumersnow shopping for sustainable cosmetics.</p> \n<h2>5 key circular beauty product opportunities</h2> \n<h3>Closing the loop: designing for success</h3> \n<p>Circularity represents a fundamental shift in system design rather than a mere addition. It captures all aspects of the circular economy, from eliminating waste to transforming unwanted products into new ones that captivate a new generation of environmentally-conscious consumers.</p> \n<p>The initial stage in fostering a more circular supply chain is identifying where waste is created. This requires a comprehensive examination of every step involved in cosmetic production and carefully considering all aspects of the closed loop.</p> \n<p>To reduce wastage and use fewer products, companies can focus on \u201cnarrowing\u201d their processes. It involves using few raw materials per product and making fewer products. For example, they can designmultifunctional beauty productslike Le Pruenier\u2019s Plum Beauty Oil, a beauty oil and moisturizer. Another example is the 3 in 1 biodegradable moisturizing scrub, exfoliator, and body wash from Honestly, a Dutch circular beauty startup.</p> \n<p>The second stage in closing the loop goes beyond waste reduction by finding practical uses for byproducts and wastes generated in the supply chain. For instance,Chanelis ingeniously repurposing Camellia husks, a byproduct of Chanel No. 1 Collection, to recreate the caps for their Red Camellia Revitalizing Cream. This practice adds value to what would have been wasted and showcases a commitment to sustainability and resourcefulness.</p> \n<h3>The power of regen ingredients: prioritize the source</h3> \n<p>Regenerative agriculture is also crucial for a circularbeauty product\u2019ssuccess. Beauty brands can refer to byproduct ingredients such as olive leaf extracts, orange peels, coffee grounds, berry seeds, and sawdust.</p> \n<p>By doing this, they can circulate their materials aggressively and, in the end, turn them into beauty products. Where can businesses get these valuable raw materials? Simple. They can partner with parallel industries and local businesses to source these ingredients. These include coffee restaurants, fruit juice processing plants, and carpentry shops.</p> \n<p>ConsiderCircumference, a New York beauty brand that uses olive leaf extracts to make itsgel cleanser. Theingredientis a byproduct of olive leaves from a family-owned California farm\u2019s olive harvest. Normally, the byproduct would have been biowaste that can be used as manure on the farm.</p> \n<h3>Unpacking single-use plastics: refill, reuse and recycle</h3> \n<p>This is a circular beauty opportunity for businesses to meet customer demands. It involves creating a system where products and packaging materials are used efficiently, waste is minimized, and resources are kept in circulation.</p> \n<p>Businesses can address this by ditching single-use plastics and designing new ones with longevity in mind. They can use recyclable, reusable, or biodegradable materials to package their products. An example is offeringrefill pouchesfor their customers so that they can reuse the repackaged bottles repeatedly.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also copyTata Harper Skin Care\u2019s Water Lock moisturizer, which features airtight packaging and a 100% recyclable refill pod. Their green glass packaging is only shipped to a customer once. By considering the entire lifecycle of their products, businesses can come up with functional items with a positive environmental impact.</p> \n<h3>Avoiding landfill: disassembling beauty packaging</h3> \n<p>The holy grail of circularity is a product not ending up in landfills. This takes inspiration from tech companies dismantling and reprocessing old products and giving them new life. Thus, the circular economy encourages businesses to design packaging that can be disassembled for material recovery, reducing waste.</p> \n<p>One example is a US mascara brand,Izzy, which reuses its steelmascara tubesand remolds its plastic brushes and wipers. Ultimately, its products resonate with customers who prioritize eco-conscious practices and desire products that minimize their environmental footprint.</p> \n<h3>Global circular cosmetics: one size doesn\u2019t fit all</h3> \n<p>The one-size-fits-all concept may not work well with the circular economy as some products may not suit everyone. Businesses can address this opportunity by recognizing individuals who have unique skin types, concerns, and preferences. They can then provide them with customized formulations.</p> \n<p>Later, customers can tailor their skincare products based on their specific needs. Gradually, businesses can minimize wastage and ensure that consumers are satisfied with the products fulfilling their requirements.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also offer diverse shades by developingcomprehensive ranges of foundation, concealers, and color cosmetics. Buyers from diverse backgrounds can find products matching their skin tone, fostering inclusivity and avoiding the wastage of limited shade options.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In summary, beginning the journey to circularity involves prioritizing a product\u2019s end-of-life considerations and scrutinizing the supply chain for waste creation points. These steps pave the way for businesses to embrace circular practices and make meaningful progress toward a more sustainable future in the beauty industry.</p> \n"}]}

So read on to learn about the shifting lifestyle interests and priorities that will shape theK-beautyindustry in 2025.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe lucrative K-beauty marketK-beauty ideas for 2025How to implement K-beauty trends</p> \n<h2>The lucrative K-beauty market</h2> \n<p>TheK-beautymarket was valued at USD12.6billion and is projected to grow at a 2.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2023 and 2027. South Korea is the world\u2019s third largest exporter of beauty care products, and #KBeauty trends have received over5.6billion TikTok views.</p> \n<p>K-beauty, popular among eco-conscious shoppers, will take a more sustainable approach to current trends. Vegan beauty, tech-fuelled individualized beauty solutions, and products that promote self-care will be popular among Korean shoppers. K-beauty will also cater to previously untapped markets like women\u2019s and men\u2019s intimate beauty care.</p> \n<p>Continue reading to learn about the major lifestyle trends and the product directions brands must focus on to connect with K-beauty shoppers.</p> \n<h2>K-beauty ideas for 2025</h2> \n<h3>Go eco-friendly and vegan</h3> \n<p>The Korean vegan beauty market was worth15.9billion in 2021 alone and is expected to grow to USD 24.8 billion by 2028. As sustainability becomes a top priority for manyK-beautybuyers, brands will incorporate it into their product formulations and packaging.</p> \n<p>The rising skepticism among consumers about vegan certifications will drive brands to adopt proper regulations and be more transparent about their products. Agencies like the Korean Agency of Vegan Certifications & Services will ensure that brands strictly adhere to vegan standards, right from manufacturing to delivery.</p> \n<p>A sizable portion ofK-beautycustomers will advocate for fully sustainable vegan products, as trends show that sustainability was a top priority for 8.3% of consumers in 2023, up from3.1%in 2022. Brands will use regenerative farming methods, experiment with biodegradable packaging, and be more careful when sourcingingredients.</p> \n<p>Brands can action the eco-vegan trend by incorporating sustainability in product development and packaging. For instance, Freshian, a vegan brand, uses cornstarch to create cushion foundation puffs, while Dearbot introduced a fully degradable cleansing sheet. As the demand for sustainability rises, brands will leverage upcycled ingredients and explore lab-grown alternatives.</p> \n<h3>K-haircare: concern for hair health</h3> \n<p>The focus will be on targeted haircare solutions that promote scalp microbiome, along with high-quality salon-grade products that deliver. The K-haircare market alone was worth USD1.2billion in 2023 and is set to grow at a 2.1% CAGR. It mirrorsskincare trendswith consumers seeking ingredient-rich, high-performing formulations that nourish scalp and hair health.</p> \n<p>Silicone-free,anti-hair-fall loss, and gray hair coverage products present the most opportunities in the South Korean market. To stand out in a crowded market, brands should offer age-specific solutions rather than follow a one-size-fits-all approach.</p> \n<p>As the economic crisis worsens, consumers will seek salon-grade at-home alternatives that reduce their overall expenses. Products that offer services like at-home hair and scalp spas will flourish. Furthermore, serums and shampoos that balance the scalp microbiome and lower the scalp temperature will be in demand.</p> \n<p>Brands can capitalize on the growinghaircarespace in South Korea by offering products that break the stereotypes surrounding hair aging. As many consumers embrace progressive products, brands can offer a range of products that help users transition to gray hair more smoothly.</p> \n<h3>Practical wellness solutions</h3> \n<p>The global wellness market is expected to be worth USD1.13trillion by 2025, indicating a strong interest in self-care. As people\u2019s lifestyles become more stressful, quick-acting, functional, and convenient wellness solutions will emerge.</p> \n<p>Shower wellness tools that provide a salon-grade spa-like experience in under 10 minutes are popular among self-care practitioners. Other tools popular in this space include salt massage bars,gua shato help relax the facial muscles, essential oils, and perfumes with aromatherapeutic benefits.</p> \n<p>Brands can be successful by creating efficient and realistic iterations of current wellness trends to attract time-crunched consumers. For example, they can provide at-home versions of spa-like services. Clapoti, a US brand, sells foot care products inspired by Korean saunas, such as creams,masks, and cleansers.</p> \n<h3>Thriving intimate care beauty</h3> \n<p>Intimate care will become more common, reflecting a shift in conservative societies\u2019 acceptance of taboo topics. This segment is expected to be worth USD61.2billion by 2027, with the introduction of gentle, science-backed formulas that meet Korean shoppers\u2019 stringent clean beauty standards.</p> \n<p>As more consumers become educated about clean beauty, they will demand products certified by experts in the field. For instance, MISMIZ, an intimate brand, collaborated with obstetricians and gynecologists to develop anintimatecare wash.</p> \n<p>Consumers will prefer individualized solutions that address specific needs over generic products. Additionally, brands will find opportunities in hormonal care, which will address the various needs in the menstrual cycle and menopause.</p> \n<p>The popularity of intimate care products will contribute to de-stigmatizing discussions about sexual wellness. Brands must rise to the occasion by catering to the previously overlooked intimatecareneeds and using their platform to educate consumers.</p> \n<p>Brands can leverage traditions like chai-yok (vaginal cleansing) to offer detox products. And lastly, brands can look into men\u2019s intimate care as it has been largely underserved in the South Korean market.</p> \n<h3>Playing with colors</h3> \n<p>Color play that encourages creative self-expression will evolve with the assistance of AI-powered solutions. The color schemes will be more intentional with users seeking personalizedcolorsolutions in make-up and hair shades.54%of Korean consumers stated that personal color played a major role in choosing beauty products.</p> \n<p>Brands are embracing diagnostic color tools that scan the user\u2019s face to assess the colors on the face to deliver customized cosmetics like foundations and lipsticks. Other tools offer customized lip shades that match the shopper\u2019s outfit.</p> \n<p>AR capabilities will be extended to physical product applications, allowing users to design an entiremakeupcollection based on their preferences. The AI tools will enable shoppers to virtually try on different colors before downloading a physical product.</p> \n<p>As colors will continue to thrive, many will be concerned about sustainability. So brands must adopt a preservationist approach to win over environment-conscious shoppers. They must be conscious of how ingredients like mica and shimmers are sourced and should explore vegan color options.</p> \n<h3>Innovative beauty care</h3> \n<p>Technological advancements will deliver ultra-convenient, high-performance solutions that will simplify daily routines. No-touch formats will thrive after the pandemic, with new iterations featuring smart designs that require no effort from the user.</p> \n<p>Wearable skincare will gain momentum with great emphasis placed on adaptable and fluid designs. These items are designed to eliminate the hassle of applying and reapplying skincare. Amorepacific, for example, has introduced a stick-on skin patch that delivers a customized dosage of actives when attached to the skin. As skin activity changes throughout the day, these patches use electronic signals to optimize the amount of actives required.</p> \n<p>These breathable, sweat-resistant electronic skin patches are infused with actives, anti-aging nutrients, and microbe-friendly ingredients that nourish and protect the skin. Furthermore, brands will embrace customization and allow customers to participate actively in product development.</p> \n<p>Brands must adopt transparency in their business practices because many consumers are concerned about data privacy. Shoppers want to know what companies do with the information they collect, so brands must reassure them that the information they collect is secure and will not be distributed.</p> \n<h2>How to implement K-beauty trends</h2> \n<p>Sustainability is a major concern amongK-beautyshoppers, and brands must ensure that sustainability is followed in all aspects of the supply chain. They must aim to reduce waste and explore tech-enabled solutions.</p> \n<p>Many consumers will seek individualized products tailored to their age and life cycle. Brands can offer menopausal support and anti-aging haircare products, categories that have been previously overlooked.</p> \n<p>Efficacy and authenticity are highly valued in the South Korean market. Brands must win over discerning customers by collaborating with experts in the field and obtaining the necessary certifications from accredited bodies.</p> \n"}]}

These products seek to address consumer concerns but with no irritation. With 71% of adults having sensitive skin, according toAveeno, gentle alt-actives are poised to dominate the skincare industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsSkincare market overviewGentle alt-activesFinal thoughts</p> \n<h2>Skincare market overview</h2> \n<p>According to Globe News Wire, the global skincare market is expected to hit USD145.82 billionby 2028. It will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of5.52%.</p> \n<p>The market is experiencing segmentation due to the demand for new formulations as skin sensitivity cases increase globally. According toStatista, the anti-aging skincare market in the U.S is projected to grow substantially between 2020-2026.</p> \n<h2>Gentle alt-actives</h2> \n<h3>Antioxidant actives: plant-based glow-givers</h3> \n<p>Plant-based antioxidants are nature\u2019s gift forskincareformulations. These powerful actives help protect the skin from damaging free radicals, pollution, and UV rays, preventing premature aging and improving overall skin health.</p> \n<p>Plant-basedglow-giversare on the ongoing rise with the \u201cno make-up make-up\u201d trend that sees the sustained demand for skincare seeking to achieve a healthy glow. Rich in antioxidants, plant-based ingredients are increasingly becoming a popular alternative to vitamin C.</p> \n<p>The trend is capitalizing on Western interest in Eastern medicine to create ayurvedic ingredients that boost appeal. French manufacturer Seppic launched TALADVANCE, a new centella asiatic ingredient sourced sustainably from Madagascar, Africa.</p> \n<p>One of the most common examples is Chebula, a brightening ingredient that contains cream, sunscreen, and serum. Centella asiatica has similar roots in Ayurveda and is popular among users due to its high antioxidant properties.</p> \n<p>Businesses should leverage the increasing demand for antioxidant actives by creating products focusing on overall skincare effects without the need for super-strength topical ingredients.

Growing demand for plant-based alt-retinol is driving sustainable options to the fore.</p> \n<p>As consumers become more conscious of the potential side effects of synthetic anti-aging ingredients, the demand for natural and safer alternatives is on the rise. One such alternative is natural retinols, which provide similar benefits without the harshness often associated with synthetic retinoids.</p> \n<p>Natural retinol is derived from plant sources such as bakuchiol, rosehip oil, and moth bean extract. They stimulate cell turnover, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve skin texture and tone.</p> \n<p>Incorporating natural retinol into yourskincare formulationscan offer your customers a safer and more sustainable alternative to synthetic retinoids. In addition, natural retinol is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, making it a versatile ingredient in your product line.</p> \n<p>Natural retinols such as bakuchiol have been under criticism due to the use of threatened plant species which creates a bad reputation. Forgotten waste and crops open up new opportunities to replace endangered plant species. BASF (Germany) Nephoria is a collagen-boosting active product of grown rambutan fruit, a byproduct of the food industry.</p> \n<h3>Skin soothers: hydrating heroes and gentle exfoliants</h3> \n<p>Hydrating heroes such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin help to hydrate and plump the skin, while gentle exfoliants like lactic acid and fruit enzymes can help to slough off dead skin cells, revealing a brighter, smoother complexion.</p> \n<p>Theseskincarepowerhouses work together to leave your skin feeling soft, supple, and rejuvenated. As the number of people with compromised skin types continues to rise, skin soothing natural hydrators, barrier-boosting ingredients, and exfoliators will emerge to address common skincare concerns.</p> \n<p>LHAs and PHAs are becoming acids of choice for sensitiveskinconcerns with the ability to gently exfoliate without irritation unlike harsher BHAs and AHAs. Proven skin hydrator hyaluronic acid is not linked to skin sensitivity, and it helps in achieving increased penetration of other ingredients and topics inadvertently causing skin irritation.</p> \n<p>Cassia flower seed is touted as a plant-based alternative source used by U.S clean skincare brands.

Evolved By Nature (US) Activated Silk 33B is made by extracting peptides from natural, renewably sourced silk, creating a unique polypeptide that supports a healthier looking skin barrier.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>Rising demand for sensitive skin solutions has sparked a growth in gentle alternatives to powerful active ingredients. Keyingredient trendsinclude antioxidant actives, skin soothers, and anti-ageing alternatives.</p> \n<p>Businesses can capitalize on these emerging trends and cater to the increased demand for gentle alternatives.

In addition, growing fashion trends and manufacturing innovations in the skincare and hair color industry also contribute to the market\u2019s expansion.</p> \n<p>Other growth factors include social media influence, recent consumers\u2019 preferences for organic cosmetic products, increasing skincare awareness among men, and the growing population of financially independent women.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, over-dependence and abuse of cosmetic products is linked to health problems due to the addition of harmful chemicals. This adverse effect is expected to hamper the market\u2019s growth during the forecast period.</p> \n<h3>Product insight</h3> \n<p>By product, the market is segmented into skincare, haircare, makeup, fragrance, and personal/hygiene products. Skincare products top this market division by holding over 38% of the total revenue in 2022.</p> \n<p>The segment\u2019s success can be ascribed to the notable increase in cosmetics such as face creams, powder, and sunscreen lotions, especially in economies like the U.S. and the U.K.</p> \n<p>Also, skincare products are widely available, mainly containing active ingredients that aid healing and nurturing the skin, enhancing market growth.</p> \n<p>The hair care segment is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% during the forecast period.

Unsurprisingly, the women segment had the highest market share, with over 62% of the total revenue in 2022.</p> \n<p>Women are often the primary consumers of skincare, makeup, and hair products, and they spend more money on cosmetics than men, which explains their segment domination.</p> \n<p>However, the male segment is anticipated to grow at a significant rate of 4.6% over the forecast period. This results from increased male awareness of skincare, haircare, andfragranceproducts.</p> \n<p>Additionally, celebrity endorsement promotes the use of more cosmetic products among men, thus providing opportunities for segment expansion.</p> \n<h3>Regional insights</h3> \n<p>Asia Pacific dominated the market in 2022 with nearly 44% of the total market revenue share.

This is attributed to factors such as better product branding, growing skincare awareness, advancements in eco-friendly products, and creative advertising methods in the region.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the rising public awareness of the adverse effects of synthetic cosmetic products threatens to hamper market growth.</p> \n<p>In Europe, well-established offline retail cosmetic stores are expected to drive market growth due to easy access to cosmetic products.</p> \n<h2>4 key Ath-beauty product trends for sellers in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Performance-enhancing solutions</h3> \n<p>Businesses can design products centered on improving their buyers\u2019 athletic performance. This can be through pre-workout supplements, protective skincare, performance metric monitors, and substance-infused workout wear that nourishes the skin while exercising.</p> \n<p>This category includes supplements containing beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) or branched-chain amino acids, protein powders, sweat-resistant makeup,sunscreen, anti-chafing balms, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and heart rate monitors.</p> \n<h3>Upgraded post-workout routines</h3> \n<p>These products aim at providing fitness-oriented customers withholistic solutionsthat adequately meet their beauty and wellness needs.

This article discusses how you can leverage this powerful ingredient to increase revenue.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket growth and demand for collagen4 advanced collagen skincare trendsMoving forward</p> \n<h2>Market growth and demand for collagen</h2> \n<p>Collagen has experienced significant market growth in recent years, driven by increasing consumer interest in health and wellness products.</p> \n<p>According to areport by Grand View Research, the global collagen market is expected to reach USD 19.9 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% from 2023 to 2030. Asia Pacific has the largest market share at 22% because of its established meat processing industry.</p> \n<p>This demand and growth are in response to collagen\u2019s various health benefits. It slows down aging and improves hair andnails. As a result, there\u2019s an upward trend in investments in collagen beauty products, boosting the industry.</p> \n<p>Because of its rapid absorption rate, market growth will also be driven by collagen in liquid form. Nonetheless, collagen is still popular whether applied topically or taken in supplements.</p> \n<h2>4 advanced collagen skincare trends</h2> \n<p>The collagen industry is evolving because of advanced technology and changing trends. The following trends will help you meet customers\u2019 needs and retain their loyalty;</p> \n<h3>1. Vegan collagen products</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers genetically modify yeasts and bacteria to producevegan collagen, making the supplement one of the best ways to improve the skin\u2019s health. Since it\u2019s grown in a lab, it can be mass-produced and scalable, reducing the cost of collagen for everyone.</p> \n<p>Consider offering vegan collagen products to environmentally-conscious consumers, educating them about the benefits of switching to biotech and vegan alternatives from bovine (cow/animal-based) collagen.</p> \n<h3>2. Marine collagen boom</h3> \n<p>Manufacturers extract marine collagen from fish scales, bones, and flesh to make various collagen products. Marine collagen products are popular because they\u2019re digestible in supplements and absorbable in cosmetics.</p> \n<p>Therefore, according tothis report, the marine collagen market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 7.35% from 2020-2025, with North America dominating the market due to its large fishing industry.</p> \n<p>Marine collagenhas immense benefits. It enhances the skin\u2019s structure and appearance and helps people maintain their youthful glow and skin elasticity.</p> \n<p>When leveraging this trend, focus on collagen\u2019s hydrating properties, i.e, how well it binds to moisture, thus reducing oiliness by maintaining moisture levels in the skin. Also, look to collagen products whose producers use biotechnology to boost their efficacy.</p> \n<h3>3. Collagen beauty supplements</h3> \n<p>In addition to their skin benefits, collagen supplements are a source of low-calorie protein.</p> \n<p>Collagen supplementshelp reduce wrinkles and skin dryness. The collagen in some of these supplements is hydrolyzed. That means manufacturers broke down the collagen protein into smaller pieces for the body to absorb it easily.</p> \n<p>Open communication will help build a trust-based relationship with your customers, which is good for business. Market collagen supplements in a way that addresses issues like sustainability, animal rights issues, and efficacy data.</p> \n<h3>4. Provide beauty opportunities beyond skincare</h3> \n<p>Collagenis not only vital for the skin, but it also improves muscle and bone health. Great collagen levels in the scalp and cuticles also boost hair and nail growth.</p> \n<p>Collagen may also help boost the health of the joints and reduce the risk of heart conditions.</p> \n<p>Provide collagen solutions beyond its skin benefits to attract customers. Offer collagen products that boost the health of the hair, tissue, and other body parts to gain a competitive edge.</p> \n<h2>Moving forward</h2> \n<p>Collagen is an essential protein that helps maintain the skin\u2019s health, but as we age, our bodies produce less of it. As a result, collagen-basedskincareproducts have become increasingly popular in recent years.</p> \n<p>The above article explores four emerging anti-aging industry trends that are changing how we think about collagen and skincare. These include the rise of ingestible collagen supplements, the use of collagen in haircare products, the integration of collagen intomakeupand foundation, and the development of plant-based collagen alternatives.</p> \n<p>With these exciting trends, collagen-based products will continue to play a crucial role in the skincare world for years.</p> \n"}]}

This article discusses ingredients-drivenskincare trendsthat can help boost your business.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket growth of skincare ingredients5 key ingredient formulations to watch out forConclusion</p> \n<h2>Market growth of skincare ingredients</h2> \n<p>The skincare ingredients market has been gaining momentum over the past few years. The market is expected to reach$39.6 billion, at a growth rate of 5.8%.</p> \n<p>Consumers\u2019 growing purchasing power and willingness to buy skincare products contribute to this growth. They\u2019re also embracing cosmetic and skincare procedures like facial treatments, hair removal services, and laser skin surgeries to improve the appearance of their skin. Common skincare problems like acne, wrinkles, and blemishes make consumers constantly look for remedies to address their issues.</p> \n<h2>5 key ingredient formulations to watch out for</h2> \n<p>Several skincare ingredients have many benefits, such as moisturizing, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties. Below are a few top ingredient formulations championing this trend.</p> \n<h3>1. Upcycled ingredients</h3> \n<p>These ingredients are repurposed food waste materials, which manufacturers source from food companies with a traceable supply chain to produce skin care products. The process also reduces waste and its effect on the environment.</p> \n<p>Examples of upcycled ingredients include coffee and cacao bean waste, tea waste, citrus extracts (from orange and lemon peels), etc.</p> \n<p>The citrus extracts insoapscontain Vitamin C, an antioxidant that prevents premature aging signs, prevents hyperpigmentation, and improves skin tone. Also, Vitamin C keeps the skin dewy, reduces oil, and fights acne.</p> \n<p>To reduce waste, provide products with packaging that includes upcycled ingredients.</p> \n<h3>2. Epidermal growth factors</h3> \n<p>Epidermal growth factor or EGF is a vital protein in the skin. It helps produce collagen, hyaluronic acid, and elastin to maintain healthy skin. It\u2019s present in the skin from birth to adulthood. But once people reach their twenties, its production starts to decrease, causing the skin to wrinkle, sag, and thin.</p> \n<p>Some of the ingredients inEGF creams, such as Hyaluronic acid, collagen, and niacinamide help clear acne, wrinkles, and other skin conditions associated with aging.</p> \n<p>As you incorporate this trend, use evidence like results of clinical trials to convince new customers about the potency of the skincare ingredients. You can also work with skincare experts to educate and create confidence for potential customers.</p> \n<h3>3. Collagen-boosting ingredients</h3> \n<p>Besides hydrating the skin and reducing wrinkles and dark spots, collagen-infused products hydrate and firm the skin. These products come in oral supplements and topical applications, easy to integrate into skincare routines.</p> \n<p>To hop on this trend, ensure you provide sustainable collagen alternatives such asmarine collagenandvegan collagento attract customers committed to sustainability.</p> \n<h3>4. Food-based ingredients</h3> \n<p>There\u2019s a growing trend towards using food-based ingredients like oats and milk in skincare. Customers can recognize these ingredients, making them more likely to feel confident about their safety.</p> \n<p>Ingredients like oats and milk are great for sensitive and dry skin.Oatscontain protein, Vitamin E, B3, and other properties that exfoliate and moisturize the skin.</p> \n<p>Whilemilkcontains lactic acid, which removes dead skin cells and stimulates the growth of new ones. Additionally, it tones and brightens the skin while cleansing it of dirt and oil.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re selling products with food-based ingredients, you\u2019ll attract young adults and older customers. But be careful as some might be allergic to these ingredients. In that case, engage customers to determine compatible products.</p> \n<h3>5. Thriving biotech ingredients</h3> \n<p>With biotechnology, brands are recreating specific properties of naturally derived substances to produce activeingredientsbeneficial to the skin. These biotech companies produce hyaluronic acid, peptides, and collagen, weaving them into various products likeserumsandfacemasksto help reduce aging.</p> \n<p>To leverage this trend, include products with clinically-proven ingredients in your catalog. Many people are conscious of lab-made products \u2014 so, educate them on the importance of each core ingredient, ensuring they\u2019re compatible with other products in their skincare regimen to improve their chances of conversion.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Theseingredient trendsreflect customers\u2019 desires, and it\u2019s best you adopt these tips to help grow your sales.</p> \n<p>Upcycled ingredients reduce eco-waste, appealing to vegan customers or people who love sustainable products. Also, research EGF-based products to attract young adults in their twenties and above, as this protein declines in the skin as they age.</p> \n<p>Collagen is also an ingredient providing benefits beyond skin care. Ensure customers understand its value by upselling or cross-selling it with other compatible products in your catalog.</p> \n<p>So keep an eye on the ingredient-led trends in this article to maintain a competitive edge in the industry.</p> \n"}]}

TheNational Institute of Healthdefines psychodermatology as addressing \u201cthe interaction between mind and skin.\u201d This combines the effects of psychological stress and dermatology, addressing how emotions and mental health play a role in external skin health.</p> \n<p>Psychodermatology can be broken down into three categories: psychophysiologic, which is how emotions affect skin health, primary psychiatric disorders, which are how mood affects the skin (which also includes self-inflicted skin ailments and hair loss), and secondary psychiatric disorders, which are how skin health affects the mood (i.e., negative body image and self-esteem issues).</p> \n<p>The following trends in psychodermatology address all these issues and even include formulas that will relax the mind and skin, target sensitive skin, and more.</p> \n<h2>Trends in the mind-skin connection</h2> \n<p>Modern consumers want to de-stigmatize conversations and understand how their stress response affects skin diseases. The current trends in psychodermatology are stress-less products and ingredients, when beauty meets mental health, going back to ancient cultural rituals, and a boom in brain care.</p> \n<h3>Stress-less solutions</h3> \n<p>Stress is a worldwide problem. Work burnout and financial problems are the main culprits, though this isn\u2019t the only category. Around 19% of U.S. adults have ananxiety disorder, which can exacerbate existing skin disorders.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that stress has a major impact on skin health.WebMDreports stress can cause itching, rashes, breakouts, bumps, and more.</p> \n<p>We can blame cortisol for this. Cortisol is nicknamed the \u201cstress hormone\u201d since it activates the fight or flight response. It also manages the inflammatory response and immune system, so high cortisol levels may contribute to eczema and acne.</p> \n<p>How can businesses combat stress and skin issues? The key is creating the right formulas.Chamomileis a sleep-inducer, perfect for adding to any nighttime or sleep-time product.</p> \n<p>Targeting the skin problems that stress causes is also a solution. Since acne is a common side effect of stress, create a stress-acne line with powerful ingredients such asbenzoyl peroxidethat consumers can easily add to an existing skincare routine.</p> \n<h3>Beauty meets mental health</h3> \n<p>Due to both primary and secondary psychological distress, the \u201cbeauty meets mental health\u201d movement is taking over. In a survey,three in five respondentsstate their skin conditions have a big impact on their confidence.</p> \n<p>Consumers demand a \u201cno to normal\u201d outlook on beauty, meaning the beauty community is more inclusive and targets all skin problems\u2013even ones that aren\u2019t mentioned frequently, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.</p> \n<p>In addition, consumers won\u2019t support brands that force customers to feel shameful about their skin; instead, the modern consumer demands companies embrace inclusivity and target mental health concerns, such as chronic stress.</p> \n<p>There are a couple of ways that businesses can approach this demand. First, sell general products everyone can use, such as facial toner sprays. Instead of selling makeup products that create a sense of shame, such as full-coverage foundations, sell simple cosmetics, such aseyebrow pencils, that accentuate the features while not covering up anything.</p> \n<p>Businesses that offer targeted solutions can tailor their marketing to simple and affordable solutions, such asacne patches. Accentuate psychological stress in your marketing and how consumers can reduce their anxiety.</p> \n<h3>Ancient culture rituals</h3> \n<p>The mind-skin connection exists in many cultures, even in ancient rituals. For example, research shows thatmassage therapydates back to 3000 BCE in India and was used as a sacred system for healing.</p> \n<p>Businesses can tap into this ritual by offeringmassage oil, using ingredients such as lavender to reduce symptoms of depression and stress while improving sleep quality.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also use certain ingredients that were once used in healing rituals. Centella Asiatica is an excellent example; this ingredient is an adaptogen used for thousands of years in India as ananti-aging ingredient.</p> \n<p>Turmericis also an effective and historic ingredient\u2013it was used in Ayurvedic and ancient Chinese medicine to treat various inflammatory conditions in people.</p> \n<p>Some consumers prefer buying products inspired by certain regions. Even though most know K-Beauty as a current trend,South Korean beautycan be traced back to the Silla Dynasty.</p> \n<h3>Brain care boom</h3> \n<p>Mental health support is going further, with businesses offering solutions for the brain-skin connection. Even though the industry mainly consists of supplements, there are some ingredients that beauty companies can offer as a self-care brain health alternative.</p> \n<p>Probiotics are a perfect example. While most know probiotics as an ingredient that improves gut health, the gut and brain have a deep connection. Therefore, probiotics are said to enhance brain health.</p> \n<p>Probiotics are becoming a demanded ingredient in skincare products, so businesses can sell askincare set containing probiotics.</p> \n<p>Essential fatty acids are also said to enhance memory, learning abilities, blood flow to the brain, and overall cognitive well-being. Ingredients such asavocadosare a natural source of essential fatty acids and are easy to add to skincare products, specifically creams and serums.</p> \n<p>While beauty brands already know that antioxidants prevent and even reverse physical anti-aging symptoms, these effects also reflect memory and brain health. This is why brands can sell moreproducts powered by antioxidants.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Psychology and skin health are entwined, so the mind-skin connection is one of the most important trends in the beauty world. Businesses can meet these demands by developing products that reduce emotional stress levels, focusing on mental health, looking back to ancient rituals, and developing products that support the brain.</p> \n<p>Businesses must keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands to remain competitive.

As a result, many health-conscious consumers are looking for gentler solutions that containnaturalingredients. The post-pandemic saw many trying alternate solutions, such as DIY masks from kitchen staples like apple cider and soda powder. Continue reading to learn more about the \u2018no-poo\u2019 movement and its impact on hair care in 2023 and beyond.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe no-poo trendsThree key trends in alternative hair care routinesThe formula for success</p> \n<h2>The no-poo trends</h2> \n<p>Products that cater to the growing demand for clean and healthy beauty solutions are gaining traction in mainstream markets. Many businesses offer customers alternative hair-washing options, and this category was valued at USD853million in 2022.</p> \n<p>The no-poo trend is gathering steam on TikTok, with132.3million users exploring the #NoShampoo hashtag. Although this method has been widely used in the black community for many years, the movement has been boosted by health-conscious individuals prioritizingnaturalingredients.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the rising costs are forcing individuals to opt for simpler routines that are multifunctional and cost-effective. Using fewer ingredients to create a more streamlined hair routine is at the core of this trend.</p> \n<h3>What is no-poo hair movement</h3> \n<p>This movement explores alternative ways of hair cleansing and can be broken into different segments. The first refers to no-poo, which involves the usage of everyday kitchen staples such as rice water or baking soda. This is because traditional shampoos are loaded with harsh chemicals which strip the scalp from its natural oils.</p> \n<p>For example, sulfates, a commoningredientin shampoo, are considered toxic. It is believed that avoiding such harsh ingredients as sulfates is a good strategy for maintaining healthy hair.</p> \n<p>Although the no-poo method has recently gained popularity in social media, it has been widely used in the black community for decades. This is because curlyhairis more porous than straight hair, making it more challenging to wash out all traces of shampoo, resulting in frizz.</p> \n<p>The second approach under this movement is low-poo, which refers to using shampoos but those that are free from chemicals that strip the natural oils from the hair. And the last approach is co-wash, which refers to the usage of conditioners that moisturize and cleanse the hair.</p> \n<h2>Three key trends in alternative hair care routines</h2> \n<h3>All-natural pantry ingredients</h3> \n<p>The DIY hair routines used during the pandemic are inspiring brands to incorporate common pantry ingredients into their product formulations. Brands are responding to the demand for naturalingredientsby renaming their formulas as rinses and cleansers because of the association of shampoos with chemicals.</p> \n<p>Many ingredient-conscious consumers are drawn to these new products because they use basic ingredients that can be found in the kitchen. For example, a well-known US brand incorporates apple cider vinegar, a common pantry ingredient, into its products. This ingredient is renowned for being an effective cleanser that smoothens and adds shine to the hair without removing color or oils.</p> \n<p>Another hero everyday ingredient taking center stage in formulas is honey which is popularly used incleansers. Similarly, the US brand Inala uses rice water in its shampoos. More brands should start using such ingredients as consumers increasingly seek scalp-friendly solutions.</p> \n<p>The American brand The Mane Choice uses micellar waters in their scalp toning cleanser, and they are considered a skincare equivalent that gently removes excess buildup and oil. Furthermore, consumers serious about haircare will be drawn to products rich in active ingredients.</p> \n<h3>Innovative hybrid solutions</h3> \n<p>Many shoppers are looking for practical solutions that simplify hair routines by combining cleansing and conditioning into a single step. Many consumers, especially gen Z, believe in the less is more approach and are looking for ways to lessen their chemical and environmental footprint.</p> \n<p>Brands such as Arkive have acknowledged this trend and have responded by offering a multifunctional cleanser that gentlycleansesand nourishes the scalp without affecting the scalp\u2019s microbiomes. Similarly, the British brand Hairstory sells an all-in-one cleansing and conditioning product that comes in various biodegradable pouch sizes, reducing waste.</p> \n<p>Customers are looking for eco-friendly brands and products that use less plastic and water during production as they become more aware of the global environmental crisis. The New Zealand company Ethique is one brand that has risen to the challenge. They sell a co-wash and conditioner formulated into a bar, limiting water use. It also contains nourishing ingredients like jojoba and shea butter, appealing to a broader audience.</p> \n<p>Brands should explore multifunctional products to categories outside of hair, keeping in mind the most recent trend for hybrid solutions driven by functionality and concerns about sustainability. For example, Singapore\u2019s Oasis sells a waterless cleanser that conditions hair while also acting as a body and face cleanser, streamlining shower and facial care routines.</p> \n<h3>No-wash routines</h3> \n<p>The no-poo movement is driving the demand for no-wash formulations, with many shoppers foregoing shampoo in favor of products that support a no-washing routine, saving time. Many brands are developing innovativesolutionsthat are similar to dry shampoos but with an emphasis on sustainability and natural ingredients.</p> \n<p>Many no-wash hair care products are available on the market, such as Sam McKnight\u2019s hair cleansing wipes, which are ideal for people constantly on the go. These wipes eliminate buildup, grease, and dirt from the scalp and hair while moisturizing it with aloe vera.</p> \n<p>Dry shampoos are no longer limited to spray aerosols but also come in foam and powder forms to meet modern needs. For instance, the US brand Batiste sells a leave-in conditioner that is applied as a foam directly onto dry hair.</p> \n<p>More companies must innovate and provide consumers with practical, outdoor beauty solutions that let them refresh their hair anywhere. For instance, the Korean business I Dew Care offers a powder for refreshing hair that comes in a compact pot with an integrated puff for easy application.</p> \n<p>The hair-conscious consumers will demand products that do not leave grease on the scalp. Brands must seek lightweight solutions and even offer supplements to be used in conjunction to promote hair growth.</p> \n<h2>The formula for success</h2> \n<p>Although many consumers may prefer streamlined hair routines, many may be unaware of the no-poo movement. Thus, brands must highlight its benefits on hair and scalp health and use marketing tactics to raise awareness.</p> \n<p>As most of the followers of this movement are looking for hair products with reduced chemicals, formulate products with natural and nourishing ingredients. Consider no-wash options, research DIY trends, and employ sustainable practices to entice eco-warriors.</p> \n<p>Due to the global economic crisis, many consumers are looking for low-cost and multi-functional products that simplify routines. So consider bulk sizes and age-inclusive products that save money.</p> \n<p>And finally, because the hair care industry is following in the footsteps of skincare trends, explore formulations that address specific issues and opt for high-performing actives that prioritize scalp health.</p> \n"}]}

There is an increased interest in nourishing serums with powerful active ingredients that provide results similar to cosmetic procedures.

This article looks at how brands are adapting to changing consumer preferences.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe flourishing beauty industryOverarching beauty trends in 2023Future-proof beauty trends</p> \n<h2>The flourishing beauty industry</h2> \n<p>The skincare market was valued at US $152.28billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.21%, reaching USD 235.8 billion by 2028. Brands are developing cutting-edge solutions inskincare, haircare, nails, grooming, and cosmetics for professional applications such as at spas and salons as well as for at-home consumer applications.</p> \n<p>Natural and active ingredients derived from plant leaves and roots are currently popular in skincare and haircare products. The curly haircare market is expected to grow exponentially during the forecast period. Furthermore, non-invasive solutions, as well as brow and lash care, are also showing great promise.</p> \n<p>This article looks at five emergingbeauty trendsas well as how brands are innovating and where they should invest in the future.</p> \n<h2>Overarching beauty trends in 2023</h2> \n<h3>Skincentric haircare</h3> \n<p>The pandemic heightened interest in homemade masks andhair health. Brands launched products for specific purposes, such ashairgrowth, scalp care, and curl care. They are also catering to different hair textures, with curly haircare emerging as the fastest-growing niche in the industry.</p> \n<p>ThalitaLEite, an American brand, offers a patented curl-defining range designed to minimize shrinkage and promote moisture. Similarly, Amika provides hydrating oils high in hyaluronic acid to reduce frizz andbreakage.</p> \n<p>Many consumers are concerned about hair loss, and brands are taking steps to educate them on how to best care for their hair. For example, the Spanish brand Simone Trichology examines hair health using digital diagnostic tools, with in-house specialists assessing each customers\u2019 hair before providing them with educational resources.</p> \n<p>As scalp care is a new trend, brands should combine traditionalhairrituals with modern science to offer effective solutions. For instance, the brand Rthvi mixes Ayurveda, an alternative and ancient Indian medicine system, with science, using scalp oils to hydrate from root to tip.</p> \n<p>To appeal to skin-conscious customers, brands should also emphasize functionality and use gentle yet nourishing ingredients free of harmful chemicals. They can employ clever product designs such as nozzles or spray applications for easy application. REVIVV, for example, sells a hair growth serum in the form of a roller ball that can be applied to problematic areas.</p> \n<h3>Lash and brow care</h3> \n<p>The brow and lashcaremarket is substantial, with many products available for spa and salon services as well as at-home alternatives for consumers. For example, Los Angeles-based Brown Down Studio offers a three-step aloe vera-based brow lamination system for salons, including a perm, nourisher, and neutralizer.</p> \n<p>In addition, Ren\u00e9 de la Garza, a self-made skincare expert, wanted to bring brow care to the mainstream, introducing brow sculptures created with freeze technology. He also sells lamination kits that help users emulate professionally laminated brows at home.</p> \n<p>Brands can capitalize on the growing interest in brow care by offering products to promote brow andlashgrowth. The products should be safe and have all the necessary accreditation to gain consumer trust.</p> \n<p>An example of how to do so is Lash Spell, based in California, which sellsbrowserums and has a blog with before and after photos of customers using their products. Furthermore, the American brand RapidLash sells serums created by experts, supported by scientific evidence, and tested by customers.</p> \n<h3>Non-invasive solutions</h3> \n<p>As the face care culture grows, non-invasive solutions that mimic the effects of cosmetic procedures will become more prevalent in 2023. Consumers want effective solutions that are free of pain and high cost.</p> \n<p>For instance, a Florida-based brand Stemtox Skin Systems offers facial treatments that resemble the effects of Botox. Their skincareproductsare formulated with plant stem cell technology, stimulating cell turnover and promoting collagen production. The serums contain extracts from acai and argan plants and stem cells from rose and apple plants.</p> \n<p>Saffron is used in skincare products by the US brand Saffron Cosmetics because of its anti-ageing properties. However, these ingredients are costly, as is reflected in the product\u2019s inflated price.</p> \n<p>With the majority of consumers seeking affordablesolutions, brands can leverage demand by offering active nourishing ingredients with plumping properties.</p> \n<p>For Instance, Florida company La Parfait offers various cosmetics solutions to improve the appearance of the skin using a combination of active ingredients. Their products contain retinol, hyaluronic acid, multi-peptides, and botanical extracts to combat wrinkles, dark circles, and fine lines.</p> \n<h3>Microbiome-focused beauty</h3> \n<p>Beauty terms such asmicrobiomeand skin barrier are likely to dominate beauty conversations in 2023, with consumers and professionals continuing to show an active interest in skin barrier repairing solutions.</p> \n<p>LaFlore, a US brand, offers a live probiotic skincare line that includes cleansers, moisturizers, and serums to protect the skin\u2019s microbiomes. They are carefully formulated with microorganisms to increase good bacteria and nullify harmful bacteria in the skin.</p> \n<p>Ingredients known to have physical and mental health benefits will thrive as companies look to bridge the gap between healthy skin and a healthy mind. For instance, Hale & Hush, a sensitive skin brand, uses soothing and therapeutic ingredients to repair the skin barrier.</p> \n<p>Brands can gain customer trust by havingmicrobiome-friendly accreditations to back up their claims. For instance, LeFlore has certifications from Kind and Biome and comes with a microbiome-friendly seal backed by protocols for different product types.</p> \n<p>Brands should also expand their microbial solutions to other product categories. For example, NY-based Neubiome sellshand careproducts with special formulas that help maintain the skin barrier and pH levels.</p> \n<h3>Beauty driven by technology</h3> \n<p>As many consumers seek personalization, technology is coming to their aid, from devices to AI-backed routines giving them tailoredsolutions. South Korea\u2019s LeBody offers a facial toning device that can be paired with personalized serums for targeted results. These microcurrent devices help the skin absorb active ingredients.</p> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly relying on technology and artificial intelligence to make informed decisions. 7E Wellness, an American company, pairs its microcurrent devices with an app that allows users to create personalized treatment plans and consult a digital skin coach.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Perfect Corp, based in Taiwan, invited attendees to try their AI skin analysis to measure variousskinparameters. Many brands collaborate with tech companies to provide their customers with a skin analysis and digital trials.</p> \n<p>Brands should reject a one solution fits all approach in exchange for digital tools that drive purchasing decisions. For instance, the US brand Myavana sells hair kits, including bags for collecting hair samples. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis, which results in a detailed report and personalized product recommendations.</p> \n<h2>Future-proof beauty trends</h2> \n<p>Because many consumers are concerned about the health of their hair, it is recommended that brands incorporate skincare concepts into haircare. Products containing hyaluronic acid and peptides that address various hair concerns and textures will become increasingly popular.</p> \n<p>Credibility must also be boosted via scientific evidence to back the brand\u2019s claims, as well as clinical trials, certifications, and demonstrations of before and after results.</p> \n<p>Create formulations containing active ingredients that produce results similar to cosmetic procedures. All products must be accredited for safety and developed by field experts.</p> \n<p>Finally, use technology to diagnose problems and create tailored solutions, including how AI can provide efficient product results.</p> \n"}]}

A byproduct of the rice industry that has traditionally been discarded as waste, rice bran can be upcycled into a captivating scent while addressing sustainability and waste reduction concerns.</p> \n<p>Robertet, a France-based fragrance company, was one of the first of its kind to embrace this note with itsCYCLESCENT collection. The collection features rice bran as the key ingredient, combined with other ingredients to create unique and captivating fragrances that are subtle yet distinctive, fresh and clean, but warm and comforting.</p> \n<p>Usingrice branin fragrances is not just innovative but also sustainable.

It has a unique and refreshing aroma, making it an ideal ingredient for fragrances with an emotional uplift.</p> \n<p>Like rice bran, fragrance brands can upcyclepeelsand other byproducts of the yuzu juice industry to create complex and more nuanced aromas while contributing to a more sustainable and circular economy. When combined with other ingredients, yuzu\u2019s refreshing and versatile notes can help to create a wide array of scent profiles, from fresh andcleanto warm and spicy.</p> \n<p>Among the key scents in the market to take complete advantage of yuzu\u2019s potential is Eau d\u2019Issey pour Homme by Issey Miyake. This refreshing and energizing fragrance featuresyuzuas a keynote.</p> \n<h3>Biotech amber</h3> \n<p>Biotech amber, as the name suggests, is an innovative approach that leverages biotechnology to develop specific amber notes. The process involves using biocatalysts to create amber molecules similar to those found innatural amber.</p> \n<p>Unlike traditional amber, biotech amber is more sustainable and ethical since it eliminates the need to extractambergrisfrom whales. In addition, during its development, the composition of molecules can be controlled, which contributes to a more consistent andhigher-qualityaroma.</p> \n<p>When it comes to scent profile, though biotech amber is very similar to naturalambernotes, it has a slightly more refined and modern character. It also has added warmth and hints of sweetness and earthiness. In addition, the biotech approach allows fragrance brands to play around with aromas while developing a\u00a0 woodier or resinous character to the final product.</p> \n<p>Several fragrance brands have already started incorporating biotechamberinto their fragrances. At the forefront of this approach is Givaudan, which uses fermentation technology to create amber molecules. However, it won\u2019t be long until other players catch up and offer a new and modern twist on the classic amber note.</p> \n<h3>Wood</h3> \n<p>Wood has always been popular due to itssophisticatedand elegant character. However, it is often used as a base note to add more depth and complexity to fragrances. Going forward, however, the advancements in biotechnology will allow wood notes to take center stage in fine fragrances.</p> \n<p>Biotech wood offers a more precise, consistent, and sustainable approach to creatingwoody fragrances, allowing for a broader range of aroma profiles. The versatility of biotech wood notes means they can be used as the main note in fragrances rather than just as a base note. This is leading to a new wave of fragrances centered around woody notes. In addition, biotechwoody notesare more sustainable as they reduce the need to harvestwoodfrom forests.</p> \n<h2>Brand strategies to monetize 2025\u2019s fine fragrance trends</h2> \n<p>The finefragrancetrends of 2025 look promising for brands that are push to stay sustainable and meet the evolving needs of consumers.

This includes everything from inexpensive foam rollers to luxurious silk and satin bands that leave hair smooth and soft. An overwhelming number of products are available, but this article offers insights into the most popular haircurlerson the market today.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe hair styling marketWhat are heatless hair curlers?How to select the best no-heat hair curler?Conclusion</p> \n<h2>The hair styling market</h2> \n<p>The global hair styling market was worth USD27.47billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9%. North America accounted for the largest market share forhairstyling tools in 2022, with Asia-Pacific being the fastest-growing region during the forecast period.</p> \n<p>Heatless hair curlers have gained popularity due to TikTok trends, where creators use this device to demonstrate their styling abilities. With a monthly search volume of 6.2K, interest has increased by 226% in the last year.</p> \n<p>Customers are curious about heatless curlers, as \u2018How to use a heatless hair curler?\u2019 was a trending question on Google Trends also revealed an increased interest in silky heatless curlers and online tutorials.</p> \n<p>There are two broad categories of styling tools, namely manual and power-reliant devices. The manual styling tools includerollers, brushes, and clips, while the latter include ironing rods, heated brushes, and straighteners.</p> \n<p>Increasing concerns about the harmful effects of heating tools is a key factor driving the heatless hair curler market. Furthermore, social media\u2019s influence on health-centric beauty applications is also expected to drive market growth.</p> \n<h2>What are heatless hair curlers?</h2> \n<p>Regular use of high-temperature flat irons, curling irons, and blowdryerscan damage hair proteins and cuticles. Although the heated treatments may initially make the hair look nice, they can cause hair loss over time.</p> \n<p>Many women are turning toheatlessalternatives due to the damage caused by heating appliances. A heatless hair curler is a device that curls the hair without applying heat. These curlers come in different varieties, including foam rollers, curling rods, velcro curlers, and magnetic rollers.</p> \n<h3>Do heatless hair curlers work?</h3> \n<p>The no-heatcurlersare designed to curl the hair without heat exposure, and they are the perfect solution for anyone looking to avoid the harmful effects of hot tools. They help create spiraled styles for a voluminous finish,\u00a0 but they work differently depending on the hair type.</p> \n<p>For example, textured or naturally curly hair will not achieve smooth waves with foam rollers or a satin wand, but it may reduce flyaways and frizz. Similarly, flat hair may not achieve mermaid waves with hair rollers but they will give the hair soft curls for a bouncy finish.</p> \n<h3>How to use a heatless hair curler?</h3> \n<p>A heatless haircurlerkit typically includes a curling rod and scrunchies or claw clips to keep it in place. These rods can be worn on wet or dry hair and are held in place with ribbons and clips. The user must then divide the hair into sections and twist each section of hair around the ribbon from the top, tying it at the end with scrunchies.</p> \n<p>Users should be aware, however, that there is a learning curve associated with this method. It may take a few attempts to determine which method works best for hair. Individuals with textured hair, for example, may need serums or a quick blow-dry to get well-defined curls.</p> \n<p>While heatless rollers are excellent for creating beachy waves for a casual day, they do not produce the same results as a curling iron.</p> \n<h3>How long must the hair curlers be worn?</h3> \n<p>Many factors influence how long haircurlersshould be worn. Velcro hair rollers, for instance, can be left in the hair for approximately 20 minutes. On the other hand, satin wands should be used on completely dry hair and can be left overnight for well-defined curls. Furthermore, accessories like a headscarf or a turban are great add-ons as they keep the curlers in place while the user sleeps and are especially useful for thicker hair that is difficult to curl.</p> \n<h2>How to select the best no-heat hair curler?</h2> \n<p>The material should be one factor taken into account when selecting haircurlers. While some are made of foam, others are made of plastic. Foam rollers are preferred to plastic ones because they are more flexible.</p> \n<p>As many consumers care about the price, it is best to go for reasonably priced products.\u00a0 And lastly, the most important factor to consider is the ability of the product to curl the hair. Look for reviews on how defined the curls are after using the product and how long it lasts on the hair.</p> \n<h3>Material of headbands</h3> \n<p>Satin and silkbandsare the most popular types of headbands available. Silk has many benefits, including reducing frizziness and making hair smoother, but they are pricey. Polyester satin is a great option for consumers on a budget because it is smooth enough to reduce frizz. However,\u00a0 Synthetic silk is not as luxurious and soft as real silk.</p> \n<p>It is also good to check whether the headbands can be machine washed when necessary. This is because certain materials, such as mulberry silk, require gentle care and can only be hand washed.</p> \n<h3>Why heatless hair curlers are good</h3> \n<p>Many consumers are opting forheatlessalternatives as they become more aware of the harm caused by the frequent use of heating tools. Heating rods use high temperatures to create curls, damaging hair cuticles. The heat dehydrates the hair, lessens its natural sheen, and can rough the texture.\u00a0 On the other hand, a heatless device will keep users out of this mess.</p> \n<p>Heatless haircurlershave become popular because they are easy to use. Even though using a curling iron might seem simpler, curling each section of hair by hand takes time.\u00a0 Heatless curlers require only a few minutes to attach to the hair before being left overnight to work their magic. So overall, there is less effort involved.</p> \n<h3>Drawbacks of heatless hair curlers</h3> \n<p>There aren\u2019t many serious drawbacks with the heatless hair curler, just minor irritations. The first disadvantage is the length of time required to achieve the desired results. Although the time varies depending on the method, users must wait until their hair is completely dry before inserting the rollers. Stronger curls will take even longer.</p> \n<p>With heatless curlers, users have lower control over the outcome. The styles produced are less structured compared to that of a curling iron. Also, the curls will not be as bouncy as those done with a curling iron.</p> \n<p>Leaving the curlers in overnight can also be uncomfortable, depending on the type of curler used. And if the user moves a lot in their sleep, the curls can loosen up a bit. And lastly, this method might not work well with textured hair.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Although the heatless hair curling method has been used in the beauty industry for decades, it has recently gained popularity thanks to social media apps such as TikTok. The market is flooded with various hair accessories, allowing users to try this viral method at home.\u00a0 VisitAlibaba.comto check out the latest hair curlers.</p> \n"}]}

However, much remains unexplored, priming brands with opportunities for innovation and change.</p> \n<p>Socio-cultural barriers in Asia have stunted the growth of menstrual health care over the years. But, thanks to new voices and increased education, the region\u2019s menstrual healthcare market is forecasted to grow faster, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% between 2020 and 2027.</p> \n<p>Heightened by the cost-of-living crisis and period poverty, accessibility of menstrual products is a major focus. Some countries have decreased the price of menstrual products by eliminating the period product tax, such as in theUK, or offering free products likeScotland. Others still need help to supply quality products at affordable prices. Some retailers and brands are implementing solutions such as \u2018buy one, give one\u2019 initiatives and discounting private-label assortments.</p> \n<p>Traditionally the menstrual care market has focused on menstruation itself by providing tampons, pads, menstrual cups and products for vulva care. Now, a 360-degree approach will welcome skincare and wellness to menstrual care.</p> \n<h2>Menstruation\u2019s new identity: period care for all</h2> \n<p>Menstruation has reached a new era as consumers demand more inclusive period products and have open conversations about menstruation. Next-gen brands are breaking down taboos and empowering everyone who menstruates.</p> \n<p>Period underwear from Thinx in the US was the first menstruation brand to feature a transgender man in a 2016 campaign. And more recently, Always removed the Venus symbol from its packaging to be more inclusive to non-female-identifying individuals.</p> \n<p>While we are seeing slow progress in menstrual products becoming more gender-inclusive, brands also need to consider inclusive products for disabled folks.</p> \n<p>Brands should avoid gendering products to ensure everyone\u2019s needs are met regardless of gender. This should include replacing terms like \u2018feminine hygiene\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019s health\u2019 with \u2018period\u2019 or \u2018menstrual care,\u2019 and when referring to those who experience periods, use terms such as \u2018menstruators,\u2019 \u2018people with periods\u2019, etc. Additionally, moving away from works such as \u2018hygienic\u2019 to describe products to avoid connotations that periods are dirty or something to be ashamed of.</p> \n<h2>Cycle syncing: care for the entire menstrual cycle</h2> \n<p>According to a survey by UK period skincare brand Fewe,69%of the 2,000 participants surveyed thought the menstrual cycle only lasted during the week they bled or had no idea how long it was. As consumers become more educated on beauty, menstruators are turning focus to the four stages of the menstrual cycle: menstrual, follicular, ovulation and luteal, to inform skincare and wellness routines.</p> \n<p>In the coming year, brands will see menstruators take more authority over their hormonal health and refocus their skincare routine to adapt to their cycle. Some may steer away from synthetic hormones, such as those found in birth control and will look toward natural hormone-supportive ingestibles.</p> \n<p>Tap into cycle care by educating your community on the changes they may encounter at each phase. Recommend existing products to tackle every stage concerning hormonal balance or skincare concerns.</p> \n<h2>Menstrual health literacy: accessible period care</h2> \n<p>Tweens and teens experiencing their period for the first time need improved menstrual health literacy.</p> \n<p>In the UK, a survey of teachers found56%of menstrual health lessons focus on biology and 40% highlight the provision of period products. Only 14% covered lived experiences. In theUS, 43% of students say periods are discussed openly at school.

Honest conversations surrounding menstrual conditions are challenging stereotypes with relief solutions.</p> \n<p>Conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) cause myriad disruptions and discomfort for menstruators, including excessive period pain, irregular periods and extreme mood swings.</p> \n<p>According to theWorld Health Organization, endometriosis affects around 1 in 10 women globally.

TheUK\u2019sestimated 4.3 billion menstrual products generated annually generate nearly 200,000 tonnes of waste. In the US,19 billion pads and tamponsare thrown out annually, with a carbon footprint of5.3kg CO2.</p> \n<p>Eco-conscious consumers are searching for more sustainable period care alternatives to decrease waste created by menstrual products. Product formats such asmenstrual cups, organicpadsandtampons,re-wearable padsand period underwear (briefs,high waisted,thongs,boy shorts/boxer briefs) are paving the way toward more sustainable period care.</p> \n<p>Brands should determine how to eliminate plastic packaging with current offerings and design and buy into products that use compostable, biodegradable and recyclable packaging. For reusable products, prioritize antibacterial and hypoallergenic properties to ensure they are safe.</p> \n<h2>Menstruation to menopause</h2> \n<p>Perimenopause can last anywhere from 7 to 10 years, usually starting between ages40 and 44. Due to a decrease in estrogen levels, menstruators may experience symptoms of irregular periods, hot flashes and night sweats, mood swings, collagen loss and poor sleep. Many people are unprepared \u2013 a 2020 study suggests that44% of womenglobally were unaware of perimenopause until they began to have symptoms.</p> \n<p>Brands are tackling perimenopause products that address symptoms, such as cooling skincare and supplements.</p> \n<p>Treat menopause literacy as equally important as menstrual literacy with resources that help to prepare for perimenopause. Science-backed Phenology (US) allows users to take a two-minute menopause assessment online to map out their needs. Include consumers in product development to address perimenopausal concerns.</p> \n<h2>The future of menstrual care</h2> \n<p>When considering the future of menstrual care, there are a few important things that brands need to keep in mind to stay relevant \u2013 inclusivity, education and accessibility, sustainability and thinking about the entire menstrual cycle.</p> \n<p>Avoid gendering period products to widen the reach to all menstruators, not just female-identified individuals and include those who have periods in product development and the marketing process to ensure all voices are represented. Promote education via accessible menstrual literacy, donation initiative, advocacy resources and online assessments to help inform product purchases. Design with and buy into more sustainable materials that help decrease waste from an essential personal care category. Compostable and biodegradable solutions or reusable formats with antibacterial properties are key. And as more consumers seek to better understand their menstrual cycles, take a 360-degree approach that comprises solutions for every phase, from hormone-balancing supplements and cycle-specific skin care to soothing period pain.</p> \n"}]}

This article investigates the major lifestyle drivers and innovations that will impact product categories in the coming years.\u00a0 Bio-synthetic inventions, waste-free solutions, and sustainable farming methods emerge as the top trends.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe beauty landscapeKey beauty concepts for 2025To sum up</p> \n<h2>The beauty landscape</h2> \n<p>As the global climate crisis worsens, many industries will face resource shortages. Many will look into more sustainable sources, such as regenerative farming and lab-grown specimens. There will be an increase in products that are stress-tested for harsh environments, such as radiation-proof skincare, as brands speculate about what the future terrains will resemble.</p> \n<p>Many brands will abandon green and sanitized aesthetics in favor of marshy textures, foggy colors, and ingredients grown through bio-syntheticinnovations. Additionally, zero-waste approaches and designs that celebrate imperfections will receive more attention.</p> \n<p>This article focuses on the key themes that will shape the beauty landscape in 2024/25.</p> \n<h2>Key beauty concepts for 2025</h2> \n<h3>Biotech beauty</h3> \n<p>Given the rising cost of raw materials, supply chain issues, and environmental concerns, plant stem cell biotechnology appears to be the ideal solution. Retrieved from nature only once, these cells serve as bio-factories that produce bio-synthetic and nature-identical ingredients. This technology is a viable alternative to traditional farming, and it requires less water and frees up land for food production.</p> \n<p>Stem cell technology will be particularly beneficial in conserving endangered plant species. Many brands are incorporating plant-basedingredientsinto their products using this technology. Orpheus skincare uses stem cells from a rare flower, and DF18+, an Italian brand, has eight patents for stem-cell actives.</p> \n<p>More companies ought to make R&D investments in plant stem cell technologies that use energy-efficient, clean, and low-resource extraction techniques to lessen reliance on natural resources. For instance, American biochemist Jesse Adler claims to extract fungi from nature only once and then cultivate the stem cells in the laboratory.</p> \n<h3>Digital beauty</h3> \n<p>As more consumers seek transparency, blockchain technology will gain traction, as QR codes on product packaging will provide all the information that hungry customers require.\u00a0 By enabling customers to track products from the seed to the finishedgood, more businesses are being transparent with their customers.</p> \n<p>Clarins, for example, has a trusted platform that allows consumers to access a product\u2019s lifecycle, including its manufacturing process, via a QR code printed on the pack. Using blockchain technology, many brands have been able to gain consumer trust. This technology is also used by the French brand Le Jardin Retrouve to reveal IFRA certificates on their products.</p> \n<p>Other companies can use blockchain to promote their social sustainability initiatives. For example, Solvay, a chemical manufacturer, uses blockchain to ensure fair and direct payments to farmers.</p> \n<h3>Climate protective formulations</h3> \n<p>With the changing weather conditions, beauty will see a rise in ultra-protective formulations, helping consumers to prepare for all scenarios. Sunscreens will provide more protection than ever and be available in variousformatsfor areas other than the face. For instance, brands are offering lip gloss and hand creams with SPF.</p> \n<p>Along with skincare, beautysupplementswill be popular to protect the skin from the inside out. Brands should exercise caution when selecting ingredients, preferring those that can withstand extreme weather conditions, such as heat and cold. Ohiohoo, for example, uses freeze-dried ingredients to keep products stable for longer.</p> \n<p>Brands should test their formulations rigorously for their stability under accelerated freezing conditions or challenging heat to simulate more accurate transit conditions. For instance, the Dubai-based company Peaceful creates skincare products, especially for the hot climate in the Middle East.</p> \n<h3>Resource efficient beauty</h3> \n<p>Due to the increasing energy costs and the need to preserve natural resources, both consumers and brands will explore ways to reduce their energy consumption. This demand for efficiency will go beyond energy consumption to include smart and efficientsolutionsthat do not sacrifice quality.</p> \n<p>Manyhair carebrands use cold processing methods to save energy and protect heat-sensitive ingredients like Vitamin E. Oasis, a Singaporean low-waste brand, sells show bombs instead of bath bombs because showers use less water and energy than a bath.</p> \n<p>To gain customer trust, brands must track every bit of energy used throughout a product\u2019s life cycle. Seppic, a French company, sells an emulsifier that saves 97% energy and 80% manufacturing time when making shower gels. It\u2019s also wise to look into no-rinse or low-rinse cleansers, such as Garnier\u2019s no-rinse conditioners.</p> \n<h3>Zero waste with plant-based ingredients</h3> \n<p>As consumers become more environmentally conscious, brands will use every fiber of a plant, from root to stem, to preserve ingredients and reduce overall waste. They will also investigate zero-waste methods. For example, the US skincare brand Muri Lelu uses the hemp plant\u2019s seed, stalk, and stem to maximize the plant\u2019s therapeutic benefits, appealing toconservativeconsumers.</p> \n<p>Regenerative farming practices will ensure that any plant waste that is unviable for cosmetic compositions is used in some way. One brand that follows this approach is the Thailand-based brand Moringa Project. They harvest moringa trees for their seeds and leaf powders and use the leftover elements as a fertilizer.</p> \n<p>Cosmetic brands should partner with other industries to be resource efficient. For instance, the British brand Baz & Co harvests basil for its cosmetics and the food industry, getting the most out of plants.</p> \n<p>Brands can tap into unconventional beauty principles by shifting the narrative about which parts of the plant are desirable. In the spirit of embracing flaws, the fragrance brand Documents\u2019 sells an aromatherapy set that uses the entire rose plant, including the stems, leaves, flowers, and roots.</p> \n<h3>More intentional</h3> \n<p>In contrast to fast-fashion beauty, a more deliberate concept known as slow beauty will gain traction. This trend will be fueled by consumers\u2019 desire for tried-and-tested ingredients with proven health benefits. Brands will also leverage ancient beauty practices that are backed by scientific evidence.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, supply chain issues will push brands to use localingredientsthat are widely cultivated. Sussane Kaufmann, a wellness brand, sources and manufactures all its products in an energy-efficient and resource-rich location in Austria. This ensures that there are no production delays.</p> \n<p>Slow beauty brands will limit product drops to manage the changing commodity prices and consider pre-orders to reduce product wastage. Ecoslay, an American brand, creates made-to-order products with a two-week lead time. And lastly, brands will explore sustainable packaging designs to minimize waste.</p> \n<h3>Biorhythmic beauty</h3> \n<p>Seasonal beautywill become more popular as a result of the disruptions in normal weather patterns caused by the climate crisis. Brands will developproductsthat are compatible with the new seasonal concepts.</p> \n<p>Aside from the four established seasons, brands will consider how seasonal changes are marked across global markets.\u00a0 Companies can educate consumers about the changes in weather patterns.</p> \n<p>Brands can help the seasonal ecosystem thrive by implementing net-zero carbon strategies and using biodegradable packaging. For instance, Bare Minerals, a US-based company, uses mycelium PR mailers and sees paper notecards as part of its sustainability efforts.</p> \n<h2>To sum up</h2> \n<p>Because many consumers are concerned about the environment, create sustainable products that help people feel more connected to nature. Consider reusable and biodegradable solutions.</p> \n<p>Due to global supply chain issues and limited resources, invest in regenerative solutions to avoid production disruptions. Consider biotechnology and lab-grown alternatives.</p> \n<p>Minimise energy expenditure, right from product designing to packaging. Reducing waste should be a top business priority.</p> \n"}]}

Owning this essential tool will not only improve the creative process but also give you a sense of real satisfaction in your work. It\u2019s so important in fact, that learning how to choose a nail brush is a must for any serious manicurist.</p> \n<p>The most frequently used manicure brushes are the liner brush, 3D brush, gel brush, oval brush, flat brush, and SIA flush brush. Among these and other brushes, there are differences in the amount of brush hair and the quality of the brush, depending on their functionality.</p> \n<p>The liner brush is divided into short, medium, and long brush types according to the length of its hair, and is mainly used for lining and painting. The gel brush, SIA flush brush, and flat brush, meanwhile, are used for gel painting, gradient color blending, and drawing checkered patterns, respectively.</p> \n<p>A good all-rounder to meet your different nail art needs is theversatile (#121) brush setfrom Chiyan Shanghai.</p> \n<h2>Choosing the right manicure brush for you:</h2> \n<h3>1. The material of the hair</h3> \n<p>There are various manicure brush head shapes that are suitable for drawing designs on nails, with each manicurist having his or her preferences and standards for the specific head shape and the corresponding painting effect. Nylon hair is mainly used for Japanese manicures, since these require delicacy and elegance, while the European and American crystal nail style is completely different.</p> \n<p>In our nail brush industry, most brushes use nylon hair, however, some high-end customers like to useanimal hair, which is soft and offers a certain toughness. This is especially true when it comes to acrylic brushes, which are bought by those manicurists pursuing quality or those who need to use acrylic powder for professional nails. There is still great variation, however, with some of these brushes being mixed with nylon fibers. At present, high-end manicure brushes offer proportions of 50%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, and 90% animal hair. The reason for such a large proportion of hair content is that manicurists have different requirements for the hardness and toughness of their brushes depending on the nail art style they are pursuing.</p> \n<h3>2. The material of the pen holder</h3> \n<p>According to the material of the brush handle, manicure brushes can be divided into those with a wooden handle, metal handle, and acrylic handle, among others.</p> \n<p>The main type of wood used in manicure brush handles is white birch, which is painted to offer a variety of colors. However, there are also redwood handles, which although also offering a variety of colors, are generally red.</p> \n<p>Currently, most manicurists are opting for thewooden handle nail brush set, which will undoubtedly become a new trend in the 2023 brush market.</p> \n<p>Metal handles come in the form of aluminum, copper, and steel, with the most common being thealuminum handle, thanks to its strong plasticity. Aluminum can be compressed into a variety of brush shapes, including pointed and flat. This material is also easily painted to offer a variety of colorful gradients.</p> \n<p>Plastic manicure brush handles most commonly use ABS plastic, which must be processed to make a variety of colors. Plastic\u2019s great versatility also offers the chance to make transparent acrylic plastic handles and handles with colored liquid or liquid glitter inside an outside plastic casing \u2013 the latter being a firm favorite in the market.</p> \n<p>Shanghai ChiYanis a well-known brush supplier offering Kolinsky brushes, nylon brushes, and other material types, all of which are made by hand. This supplier provides brushes for precision and efficiency in nail art. Additionally, the variety of shapes and sizes available allow for easy maneuverability and access to hard-to-reach areas, making them ideal for both professional and personal use.

This progression can also be seen on the runways, with over-the-top hairdos and dramatic aesthetics. This post will examine the key themes, including the color and cosmetic trends dominating the market today.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsBeauty trends straight from the catwalkThree overarching themes from 23/24 runwaysKey focus points</p> \n<h2>Beauty trends straight from the catwalk</h2> \n<p>The autumn/winter trends for 2023/24 combine bold statements with subtle, conservative classics. In keeping with previous seasons, this season features minimal beauty accompanied by barely-there makeuplooksand finished with glowing touches. Also from the past season is the toned-down look that promotes raw beauty.</p> \n<p>Apart from natural and lazy beauty, artful aesthetics that encourage experimentation and promote the weird side of beauty is also in trend. Also, present this season is a theme of whimsicalness along with sculptural hairdos reflecting fantasy.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, celestial beauty, which leans into the rising interest in digital avatars and space exploration, will grow in popularity.</p> \n<p>This article explores the major beauty themes from the runways this season, including nails,hair, and color trends. It also provides insights into how brands can leverage each trend.</p> \n<h2>Three overarching themes from 23/24 runways</h2> \n<h3>Major beauty schematics</h3> \n<p>The industry is shifting away from dramatic aesthetics in favor of subdued emotional and soft gothic aesthetics, as seen on the runways of major fashion labels such as Christian Dior, Fendi, and Roberto Cavalli. As a result, darker smudgeablepigmentsfor the eyes and lips will be popular. For instance, cranberry juice and blacklip colorsin velvet and matte finishes will be appealing.</p> \n<p>Following the trend of the subtle statement, low-maintenance beauty that promotes self-expression and challenges the norm will emerge. Multi-functionalproductsthat can be used on any part of the face, such as liners and pencils, will be prioritized by brands. To instill a positive attitude, go for colors that reflect winter hues.</p> \n<p>Another trend getting traction on social media is #weirdbeauty, which celebrates the unexpected. This trend rejects normality in exchange for eccentric beauty. Brands can champion this trend by offering products that make shoppers question beauty. It is best to go for sustainable and sensitive skin-friendly solutions.</p> \n<p>This look is defined by haphazardly applying sparkles and glitters to the eyes, lips, and cheeks to achieve an ethereal, awe-inspiring glow. The celestial glow trend was spotted on the runways of major fashion houses such as Diesel, Harris Reed, Thom Browne, and Francesa Liberatore.</p> \n<p>Brands can action this trend by leaning into shimmery aesthetics with chromaticfinishesand hedonistic metallics in their color cosmetics.</p> \n<p>The lazy beauty is seen on the runways of many fashion labels and is characterized by barely there make-up and tousled hair for an effortless aesthetic. Brands can capitalize on this trend by offering do-it-all haircare and skincare products that save time, money, and natural resources. The emphasis should be on radiant skin with a glowing finish.</p> \n<h3>Color trends</h3> \n<p>A single style no longer defines brows; colored, embellished, and spiky brows are all prominent on the catwalks this season. To appeal to a wide range of consumers, brands can leverage the brow movement by offering all-in-one brow kits consisting of pens,gels, and pencils in ethereal and natural tones.</p> \n<p>Seen on the runways of Vaquera, Gucci, Weinsanto, Kim Shui, and Talia Byre, lips with dualtoneshave made a major fashion statement this season. They come in exaggerated dark-to-light shades as well as subtle light-to-dark Ombre.</p> \n<p>Brands can get on this trend by experimenting with dual-sided lip pens in complementary hues for a seamless color transition. For example, the candy orange shade at Gucci changed to a brighter red.</p> \n<p>The advent of expressive cosmetic applications helps bridge the gap between reality and fantasy. All fashion labels challenge traditionalbeautynorms through their creative embellishments and color use.</p> \n<p>This trend reflects a desire for unconventional makeup applications, and brands can capitalize on this interest by providing multi-purpose eye and face products.</p> \n<p>Keeping with the trend of toned-down aesthetics, this look focuses on smudged-out eyes in dark shades, as seen popularly on TikTok. These gothylookscan easily be created with the help of smudgeable eye pencils.\u00a0 This trend is famous for using purple-red pigment under the eyes to create an emotional aesthetic.</p> \n<p>Bold lash aesthetics have dominated all runways this season, accompanied by spider lashes. This look is complete by adorning the lower lashes with 60s-inspired drawn-on lashes or using small clusters of faux lashes.</p> \n<p>To leverage this trend, brands can explore graphic eyeliners that are smudge and water-resistant. As sustainability is a growing concern among many young consumers, exploring alternatives like reusablefaux-minx is wise.</p> \n<h3>Hair</h3> \n<p>This season, big fashion houses like Rick Owens and Francesa Liveratore showcased many gravity-defying hair looks. The main takeaway from this trend is the ability to express oneself through hairstyles.</p> \n<p>Brands can capitalize on this trend by providing weatherproof, high-qualityhairsprayswith a high-sheen finish. This season, styling kits with clip-on hair extensions will also be popular.</p> \n<p>Continuing the hair sculptural trends, braids in unique styles were popular this season. Long braids, baby braids, and thickbraidson various hair types were seen frequently at Tia Adeola and Simon Rocha.</p> \n<p>Brands can look into styling products such as gels, oils, and sprays that aid in creating slick braid styles with no flyaways. Hair tips, pins, and clips allowing perfect plaits are also good accessories.</p> \n<p>Even though the middle parting is still trendy and alive, the side parting is gaining traction. Side partings have become the new standard, as seen on the runways of Fendi, Altuzarra, MSGM, and Acne Studios.</p> \n<p>Brands can cater to this trend by offering high-shine gels,sprays, and oils that help create a sleek hairdo. They can look into styling products like fine tooth combs that help manage flyaways.</p> \n<p>Hair accessories such as ribbons andbowsare commonly used in hairstyles in Paris and London. This hairstyle both contradicts and complements the toned-down and carefree beauty aesthetics.</p> \n<p>To appeal to Gen Z consumers, brands can capitalize on this trend by offering clip-in bows and loose ribbons made from sustainable materials. They can also look into recycled fabrics to create a significant impact.</p> \n<p>This trend appeals to bold, daring individuals who enjoy experimenting with different aesthetics. Brands can support this trend by providing temporarydyesin spray formats that color the hair without causing damage and is easy to wash out. They should also ensure that these dyes are compatible with all hair types.</p> \n<h2>Key focus points</h2> \n<p>There is a noticeable presence of hybrid products this season. Look into multi-use products that offer coverage and skincare benefits.</p> \n<p>Explore products reminiscent of retro styles as aesthetics inspired by the 1990s and 1980s gain traction among millennials. Focus on glosses and lip liners in vibrant, pigmented tones.</p> \n<p>Encourage experimentation by offering multi-use cosmetics that embrace imperfections and the unpopular side of beauty. Explore products with light coverage while adhering to the principles of sustainability.</p> \n<p>Reject notions of perfectionism in exchange for beauty that champions creative self-expression. Brands should clearly reflect the messaging of their products.</p> \n"}]}

These are increasingly summarized and represented by various beauty personas, from those who prioritize practicality to individuals who use beauty as a creative outlet.</p> \n<p>By understanding these personas, brands can stay ahead of the curve and tailor their sales and marketing strategies to match their customers\u2019 needs. Read on to explore six consumer profiles that are gaining traction in the current market.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhy beauty personas are important to the market6 emerging beauty personasStaying in the know</p> \n<h2>Why beauty personas are important to the market</h2> \n<p>Beautypersonas are gateways that brands can use to target specific consumer groups and introduce products that are relevant to them. When targeting consumers, these brands not only consider demographic data and gender but also the customer\u2019s consumption values.</p> \n<p>These personas define what product segments are relevant for the brand\u2019s marketing strategy, which also provides insight into what product categories may experience growth at any given time.</p> \n<p>In 2019, the global market for cosmetics reachedUS $380.2 billion, a figure that is anticipated to grow to US $463.5 billion by 2027, a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% from 2021 to 2027. Personas who value sustainability and project a \u201cnatural\u201d look are currently driving the market, aligning their principles with a clean-and-green outlook and further establishing the pursuit of a \u201chealthy\u201d lifestyle as a significant purchase driver.</p> \n<p>A deep understanding of these personas helps you and your brand to align products to better connect with your target buyers. This hopefully not only leads to increased sales but also helps to establish brand loyalty.</p> \n<h2>6 emerging beauty personas</h2> \n<h3>Skintentionals</h3> \n<p>Consumers who focus on the emotional, mental, and physical aspects of beauty are calledskintentionals, a combination of the wordsskin+intentional. For these individuals, their product choices and beauty routines serve a practical purpose that benefits their overall well-being.</p> \n<p>Particularly, they are looking at brands and products that provide a sense of self-love and self-care \u2013 not just as an advertising claim but also in terms of formulations. Therapeutic skin care with healthyingredientsis a good example of this. It\u2019s worth noting that skintentionals are well-informed as they do their research before making purchases.</p> \n<p>This persona isn\u2019t bound to just one gender but rather applies to all, and their interests manifests in products such as all-inclusivehydrocolloid patchesand multi-purposeserum foundations, which also promote skin care. Skintentionals are also willing to pay extra for additional value and personalization.</p> \n<h3>Techsperts</h3> \n<p>Consumers dubbedtechsperts(fromtech+experts) tend to chase techy and advanced beauty tools. The main reason behind this is that they want to take their beauty rituals to the highest possible level, pairing their creams and topicals with electronic equipment that result in an overall supercharged effect.</p> \n<p>Some techsperts like to usemesotherapy devices, which help to infuse their skin with vitamins and enzymes. And while they\u2019re interested in such innovative tools, these consumers are also concerned about efficacy and cleanliness. As such, they\u2019re willing to invest in premium and professional-grade solutions despite potentially wallet-busting costs.</p> \n<p>Neck and face liftersare also popular items among techsperts, especially Gen Xers, who are often well-informed about new beauty devices. These aspects aside, personalization also plays a key role in their purchases, and some may even use AI-drivenmakeupsimulators to suggest products before they buy their eyeshadows and eyebrow pencils.</p> \n<h3>ReGens</h3> \n<p>With a focus on more than just sustainability,ReGens(from the wordregeneration) look forbeauty productsand services that contribute to restoring environmental health. They tend to avoid items made of purely natural ingredients, resulting in a rise in demand for synthetic and lab-grown elements.</p> \n<p>Supply chain transparency plays a key role here, as these individuals are eager to know where components of a certain product have come from before purchase. For example, they might chooselip essenceswith synthetic vitamin C over those made with the vitamin\u2019s natural counterpart.</p> \n<p>Synthetic fragrances that deliver good quality have also seen an increase in demand in accordance with these principles. ReGens appreciate brands backed by certifications and also have no problem with paying higher prices, especially since synthetic ingredients tend to cost more.</p> \n<h3>Skinics</h3> \n<p>Skewing to the beauty industry\u2019s more political tendencies,skinicsplay a key role in breaking beauty standards and representing underrepresented communities. To be specific, they appreciate brands that take tangible steps to achieve change, and avoid those that only use sentiment-driven advertising.</p> \n<p>Skinics look for apt cultural appreciation in their industry, for example, using traditionalshea butterfor skin care, which originates from African culture. Skinics also place value on transparent supply chains, with an emphasis on cost breakdown, materials sourcing, and operations.</p> \n<p>Individuals from Gen Z, considered a particularly socially-conscious or \u201cwoke\u201dgeneration, primarily makes up this persona. They also help make the beauty space all-inclusive, welcoming those from the wider gender spectrum as well as from the Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) community. This inclusivity can be seen via an increasing demand fortinted foundationsfor darker skin and unisex products.</p> \n<h3>Preservationists</h3> \n<p>Appreciating efforts to preserve the environment\u2019s natural resources,preservationiststend toward locally produced and ethically sourced beauty products. They look for brands that espouse minimal carbon emissions (from transportation and shipping) and also restrictions on the number of resources harvested for each product batch.</p> \n<p>Small-batch productions are also well-received among people of this persona, which ensures product potency. Handmade crafts and seasonal releases keep offerings fresh and cultivate curiosity. Eco-friendly supplies such asrefillable beauty productsare gaining traction among preservationists.</p> \n<p>Aside from biodegradability and recyclability, upcycling of products is also a point of attention for these individuals. A good example of this is the trend of brands using grapes processed for winemaking to createfragrances. This leads to virtually no waste at all as they are brought to their full potential.</p> \n<h3>Chameleons</h3> \n<p>Consumers dubbed aschameleonsare those who like to adopt several looks that embody the multifactes of their creative self, using beauty as a way to express their emotions and sentiments. More often than not, they go for anti-perfectionist styles, which emphasize their love for creativity over existing beauty standards.</p> \n<p>Aside from basic care, chameleons are also looking forbroad-palette makeup sets, which allow them to explore various colors and looks. It\u2019s worth noting that they\u2019re happy to pay significant amounts to achieve their preferred aesthetics. Some might also use AI tools to supplement their creativity to achieve otherworldly appearances.</p> \n<p>In relation to complex and mesmerizing makeup, these individuals also value qualitymakeup removers. This shows that skin care is still an important facet for them, which comes from the fact that they\u2019re usually from Generation Z.</p> \n<h2>Staying in the know</h2> \n<p>In a constantly evolving beauty industry, it\u2019s essential for businesses to keep up with their target consumers\u2019 changing preferences and beliefs.</p> \n<p>By understanding emerging beauty personas and what they prioritize, brands can tailor their products and marketing strategies to meet their customers\u2019 needs.</p> \n<p>Whether your consumers value practicality or creativity, staying ahead of the curve is key to staying relevant in the industry. Don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to differentiate your business and build lasting customer connections.</p> \n"}]}

Even though sensitive skin isn\u2019t a medical condition, it can come with common problems such as acne and dry skin, while those with skin health problems like eczema, allergic contact dermatitis, and psoriasis tend to have sensitive skin.</p> \n<p>Asia-based cosmetic and skincare companies adapt their formulas to fit the unique needs of their APAC consumers. These sensitive skin formulations also target a global consumer base, heightening the influence that regional beauty companies, such as K-beauty brands, have on the worldwide skincare community. This is integral for those with sensitive skin who can\u2019t find the right products in their country.</p> \n<p>But are sensitive skin products becoming the new standard, especially in the APAC market? Here\u2019s what beauty businesses should know.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of APAC sensitive skin productsPopularity on social mediaAPAC sensitive skincare prioritiesGrowth opportunitiesConclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of APAC sensitive skin products</h2> \n<p>There are many reasons why sensitive skin is more common among APAC consumers than others. Pollution and stress are the primary sensitive skin triggers. Certain skincare products can also cause allergic reactions, specifically ones that contain dangerousingredients.</p> \n<p>Current events exacerbate sensitive skin. The COVID-19 pandemic is the perfect example: more people wore masks, which caused sensitivity symptoms like red, dry, and itchy skin.</p> \n<p>Because more consumers are opening up about their sensitive skin, the demand for natural and clean topical products is increasing.</p> \n<h2>Popularity on social media</h2> \n<p>We\u2019re living in the era of body positivity. More people want to be honest about their flaws and concerns, using social media to express themselves. This also leads to more information about sensitive skin and which products users should try.</p> \n<p>One of the most popular hashtags is#ProudlySensitiveSkin, where users share their stories and experiences struggling with sensitive skin.</p> \n<p>Even though consumers are more comfortable with their sensitive skin concerns, businesses should still find solutions to treat sensitivity and create products designed for all skin types. These include products made with gentle ingredients and without fragrances.</p> \n<h2>APAC sensitive skincare priorities</h2> \n<p>APAC consumers demand clean and natural ingredients that won\u2019t irritate their skin. This market also prefers specific formulations that won\u2019t feel heavy on the skin.</p> \n<p>We can break sensitive skin consumers and trends into different categories:</p> \n<p>Keep these consumers in mind when selling sensitive skincare products.</p> \n<h2>Growth opportunities</h2> \n<p>Businesses should sell products that meet the needs of those with sensitive skin conditions. Prioritize products that are lightweight, reduce skin irritation for women going through menopause, include body care, and use gentler active ingredients.</p> \n<h3>Lightweight finish</h3> \n<p>Moisturizers and serums with specific finishes can irritate sensitive skin. Greasy and sticky products can clog pores, causing acne and other problems.</p> \n<p>The best way that consumers can prevent these issues is by using skincare products with lighter finishes. Sunscreen is the perfect example.This sunscreenis made with simple ingredients. It absorbs into the skin swiftly, so it feels weightless all day.</p> \n<p>Spray tonersalso feel refreshing on sensitive skin. Sell products made with rose water, which soothes dry and irritated skin.</p> \n<h3>Menopausal skincare</h3> \n<p>Specific bodily changes, such as menopause, make skin more sensitive. Dry and itchy skin are common menopause side effects. More women in this demographic seek products to help soothe their irritated skin.</p> \n<p>Start by selling skincare kits made for sensitive skin types.This skincare kitalso offers hydration and anti-aging benefits.</p> \n<h3>Below-the-neck</h3> \n<p>APAC consumers take the same approach to facial care for the rest of the body. Sensitive skinbody lotionsare a body care staple, but this isn\u2019t the only product businesses can offer.</p> \n<p>Bath bombsare trending. They cleanse and hydrate the skin, though they are still gentle. Instead of soap body wash, more consumers are switching topowder body wash. This wash is activated by water, resulting in a more delicate formula that protects the skin barrier.</p> \n<p>Finally,shaving creamsfor sensitive skin types will give users a close shave without irritation.</p> \n<h3>Alt-actives</h3> \n<p>Alt-actives are alternative formulations of strong ingredients, making these products ideal for sensitive skin types without losing their performance.</p> \n<p>For example, those with sensitive yet acne-prone skin often seek alternatives to benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and other common deep-cleansing ingredients.</p> \n<p>Kaolin is an excellent example of an acne-fighting and sensitive skin-friendlyingredient. Kaolin is a type of clay that absorbs sebum and prevents clogged pores. Users with acne-prone and sensitive skin can use adeep cleansing maskwith kaolin.</p> \n<p>More users are also choosinghemp skincare products. Hemp is a plant that decreases irritation. It\u2019s a great alternative to niacinamide, which can cause users discomfort.</p> \n<p>Even though hyaluronic acid is a powerful ingredient, it\u2019s still gentle enough for sensitive skin. Hyaluronic acid is often found in anti-aging products like thisfacial serum.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>More consumers in the APAC market suffer from skin sensitivity, making sensitive skincare products a norm. APAC consumers experience more sensitivity than others due to pollution, stress, and current events, such as COVID mask-wearing, which has enhanced skin issues.</p> \n<p>But sensitiveskincare trendsgo beyond selling clean and natural products. Since sensitive skincare products are the standard, businesses should sell items with lightweight finishes, that are made with gentler alt-actives, and focus on face and body care. They should also prioritize certain clients, such as women going through menopause.</p> \n<p>In order to stay competitive, businesses must keep up with beauty and personal care trends. This is especially vital for companies in worldly markets. Continue reading theBaba Blogto keep up with the latest in the industry.</p> \n"}]}

The market\u2019s primary propellers include increased consumer consciousness regarding appearance and the influx of cosmetics with non-toxic and organic ingredients.</p> \n<p>The lockdown restrictions also had an immense impact on the industry\u2019s growth. It cut down the supply chain and pushed demand to a standstill, inflicting a hit on commodity sales for online and offline channels. Regardless, experts believe the market is on a fast track to a full recovery.</p> \n<h3>Type insights</h3> \n<p>The standard beauty product segment generated the highest market share (over 84.9%) in 2021.\u00a0 It witnessed more demand due to its low price advantage and availability globally. Nevertheless, these conventional products contain high levels of petroleum-based ingredients, making them harmful to the skin and less eco-friendly to produce. As a result, their demand may dwindle over the forecast period.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the organic segment will register impressive market growth. With more people moving to organically-sourced cosmetics, experts expect the shift to push the market forward over the forecast period.</p> \n<h3>Distribution channel insights</h3> \n<p>In 2021, specialty stores emerged with the highest market share of 35.7%.

The story deals with products focusing on physical and mental well-being, allowing women to build emotional resilience during beauty routines.</p> \n<p>Retailers can take this approach by adding books (with daily readings) to theirproduct packaging. Such a shift can help consumers explore the intersections of their physical and inner selves while they enjoy their skincare routines.</p> \n<p>Also, sellers can add affirming mantras to every stage of theirskincareand make-up products, transforming each beauty moment into a personal ritual.</p> \n<p>Businesses can also leverage this trend by adopting a 360oholistic approach for inner-outer solutions. Look into products like adaptogenicskincare, bath/body care, home fragrance, and supplements for each wellness concern.</p> \n<p>Emotional beauty also transcends to the inner system, promotingingestible productsto target the gut with nourishments for smoother skin.</p> \n<h3>Functional flexi-taskers</h3> \n<p>Who said basic products have to be boring? Functional flexi-taskers update simple beauty items with intelligent designs, supporting consumers with stress-fuelled lifestyles. This trend aims at providing products that can adapt and flex to individual buyer needs, helping them enjoy their routines stress-free.</p> \n<p>For example, retailers caninvest in balmsthat provide hydrating, anti-aging, bacteria-fighting, and wound-healing properties. They can also stock up on products that soothe sore muscles and heal sunburn.</p> \n<p>Functional flexi-taskers take bulk buying to a new level with upgraded all-in-one formats, helping to improve house proud aesthetics and clean credentials. For instance, businesses can dive intobody washeswith properties that can remove makeup, control breakouts, and moisturize the skin with natural ingredients.</p> \n<p>Consider adopting formulations with developed application tools for intentional and multifunctional self-care moments. Products like a3-in-1 glow barare worthy investments in this story. Such products can feature interesting shapes while sculpting, moisturizing, and imparting a subtle glow on the user\u2019s skin.</p> \n<h3>Chaotic wellness</h3> \n<p>Recent trends push back against the toxic wellness culture, and chaotic wellness follows suit. Instead, it focuses on products that support more fluid and forgiving beauty routines, helping to attract more Gen-Z audiences practicing self-care based on their rules.</p> \n<p>This time, the focus is on accessibility and ease of use. One product turning the tide this season isbeauty patches. Retailers can focus on variants that offer a sustained ingredient release over 12-24 hours. The product may also provide focus, sleep, and personal care offerings.</p> \n<p>Further, sellers can invest in stress-free skin, hair, andpersonal care formulasthat are also travel-friendly.

Retailers may take it further by addressing brown and black hyperpigmentation concerns through serum sticks andbrightening creams.</p> \n<p>Third cultural beauty appreciates multicultural differences instead of appropriating them.

For example, consider investing insex toysfor buyers with disabilities, allowing everyone to experience sexual pleasure.</p> \n<h3>Power of proof</h3> \n<p>Nothing is certain until proven otherwise in recent times, leading consumers to question everything and guide their choices with positive cynicism. \u201cPower of proof\u201d employs radical honesty and transparent communication to address consumer concerns over claim-washing, pricing, and sourcing.</p> \n<p>Retailers can create channels to engage consumers to answer questions and take criticism. Also, they can consider investing in third-party platforms and accreditations to include an extra credibility layer.</p> \n<p>In addition, sellers should opt for products with scannable QR codes, allowing consumers to understand the ingredient choices and make informed buying decisions.</p> \n<h3>Modern heirlooms</h3> \n<p>Modern heirloomsdraw inspiration from myths and folklore to make creative product designs. Luxury will become essential in a product\u2019s background story as more frugal consumers flood the beauty world.</p> \n<p>Investing in products with transportive scents, ancient ingredients, andartful packagingwill imbue discovery and opulence into the everyday beauty routine. However, businesses must be careful to avoid offending the sensitive consumer base.</p> \n<p>Only stock up on items that respectfully reimagine the past and look into archives for long-lost inspiration.</p> \n<h2>Monitor these trends</h2> \n<p>In times of stress, consumers will always value kindness and care. Hence, businesses must offer products and services that make life less overwhelming while supporting physical and mental well-being.</p> \n<p>Additionally, one size no longer fits all\u2014speak to the person and not the consumers with designs for the individual. Full representation is non-negotiable this time, as consumers need more options that address specific concerns.</p> \n<p>These are the Inter-Actions beauty forecast trends to focus on for the upcoming 24/25 A/W season.</p> \n"}]}

However, the hair care industry is slowly becoming more inclusive, with brands now offering natural and clean formulations for all hair types.</p> \n<p>The US black haircare market was worth USD1.6 billionin 2021, but only 52% of the consumers said their hair textures were represented in Ads. The pandemic saw many anti-Eurocentric beauty standards and people embracing their natural curl textures while seeking non-toxic products to manage their hair.</p> \n<p>Brands like This Hair of Mine andMielle Organicsare catering to this demand by offering premium formulations that prioritize hair health for diverse hair textures.</p> \n<p>This article looks at five major trends in the curlyhair careindustry and how brands adopt different strategies to dominate the market.</p> \n<h2>Top five trends dominating the curly hair care industry</h2> \n<h3>Black-owned beauty</h3> \n<p>For far too long, the industry has ignored curly hair consumers by focusing solely on products for straight or wavy hair. However, the industry is changing, with brands such as Pattern Beauty making a name for themselves. These companies provide many products to treat, wash, style, heat, and support curly haircareroutines.</p> \n<p>As many consumers use heat styling products, brands recognize the importance of providing high-quality styling tools likehair dryersdesigned to reduce heat damage. These dryers are equipped with ION technology to smoothen and tame the cuticles.</p> \n<p>One trend that will continue is the demand for scientifically tested formulations made with natural,clean, and safe ingredients. Moreover, brands must incorporate all these components and offer a line that caters exclusively to textured hair. Pattern Beauty, for instance, offers various conditioners and shampoos to support different hair porosities and thus promote curl definition.</p> \n<p>Curly hair is dominated by BIPOC-owned brands, with many celebrating and empowering curly-haired women by catering exclusively to curly hair needs. Some even have educational blogs with curly hair styling guides.</p> \n<h3>Hair care for Latinos</h3> \n<p>As discussed previously, textured hair was overlooked by most prominent brands, but now many are emerging, catering exclusively to specific communities. Earlier, coiled hair was referred to as \u2018pelo malo,\u2019 translating to bad hair, but brands are changing the psyche by encouraging consumers to accept their naturally coiled hair.</p> \n<p>Rizos Curls, a prominent brand in the Latino community, sells silicone-free styling and scalp products and provides free online tutorials in Spanish and English to educate users about curly hairmanagement. They have also responded to modern demands by using sustainably sourced and organic ingredients and offering refillable bottles to reduce waste.</p> \n<p>As sustainability is a priority among many shoppers, brands are going the extra mile by partnering with NGOs to support climate-friendly initiatives.</p> \n<p>Moreover, brands can win over customers by incorporating their feedback into product development. Rizos Curls, for example, launched its award-winning hair spray after engaging with its customers and discovering a need for such a product.</p> \n<p>Latino-owned brands are gaining visibility in the market, especially as retailers such as Target dedicate space exclusively to such brands.</p> \n<h3>Affordable and clean hair care</h3> \n<p>As textured and curly hair care products gain popularity, many seek low-cost,cleanproducts that do not compromise efficacy. Brands like 4U are responding by providing affordable products priced under $11. Such products are manufactured to be used by the entire family, and many brands collaborate with mass retailers such as Walmart to make them more accessible to customers.</p> \n<p>Brands now offer family-sized shampoos and conditioners in formulations that are age- and gender-inclusive to provide cost-effectivesolutions. As sustainability is also non-negotiable, 4U offers products made with a patented biotech molecule derived from ethically grown sugarcane, which also serves as an alternative to silicone.</p> \n<p>Brands such as 4U are making a name for themselves by claiming to use superior ingredients and that their formulations are EWG verified and free of toxins, silicones, parabens, and sulfates all while remaining affordable and accessible.</p> \n<h3>Sustainable solutions</h3> \n<p>Many consumers seek sustainable solutions as they become more aware of climate change. One US brand, Ecoslay, champions the sustainable cause by providing low-waste solutions for coily and curly hair. They are gaining popularity because theirproductsare free of harsh ingredients such as parabens and sulfates, and they use fewer preservatives in their formulations.</p> \n<p>To source their ingredients, brands like Ecoslay work with eco-friendly farms because sustainability is a core value of the company. They follow a natural-first philosophy and only use synthetics when necessary. The items are packaged in paper pouches that can be dispensed into glass jars. These pouches are completely recyclable and lightweight, which helps to cut down shipping-related emissions.</p> \n<p>Many conscious shoppers favor companies that adhere to sustainable practices throughout production and delivery. This is when Ecoslay kicks in because, in addition to their sustainable approach to sourcing and packaging, all their products are handmade in order to cut down on excessive waste. They have a two-week wait time to produce and deliver the items to customers.</p> \n<p>Eco-friendly brands also encourage their customers to recycle, and many reward customers who return empty pouches with redeemable points towards the purchase of a new product.</p> \n<h3>Salon-quality results</h3> \n<p>Many brands are providing high-quality, easy-to-use products with high-performing actives to assist consumers in taming their curly hair at home. Vernon Francois, for example, offers salon-grade hair careproductsdesigned specifically for curly hair and also has an online learning platform that provides styling tips.</p> \n<p>As many consumers have previously voiced their displeasure about greasy, thick, and heavy formulations, Vernon Francois has responded by offering lightweight formulas that boost the bounciness of hair without wearing it down. One of the most popularlightweightitems from the brand is its non-sticky, spray-on, leave-in conditioner with amino acids.</p> \n<p>Thanks to its proprietary formulations and easy-to-use products, Vernon Francois is making waves in the industry. Their hairsprays, for example, use innovative spray technology to distribute the product into the hair for easy, even application. They also do not believe in the one-size-fits-all approach, so they cater to a wide range of customers with diverse products.</p> \n<h2>Key focus points</h2> \n<p>Representation is important, and brands should ensure that diverse representation is present at all stages of product development, from product testing to advertising. Thus, it is essential to collaborate and co-create with the target group.</p> \n<p>Curly hair is not uniform, so brands should cater to individual needs by taking hair density, diameter, porosity, and pattern into account when developing product formulations.</p> \n<p>All-natural ingredients are in high demand in curly hair care. However, due to supply chain issues and the impending climate crisis, lab-grown alternatives are a good option.</p> \n<p>Safety and clean formulas are a top priority for many. Brands should incorporate active ingredients that nourish and protect the hair and validate all claims with clinical and consumer testing.</p> \n"}]}

Unfortunately, the community of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) might find it challenging to discover suncare products that work on their wide skin color gamut.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, trends are emerging in the beauty industry to better cater to the specific needs of BIPOC individuals.</p> \n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the top four trends contributing to a more inclusive suncare market, as well as how to keep your business ahead in this expanding market.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market for suncare4 trends in BIPOC suncareEmbracing BIPOC suncare</p> \n<h2>The market for suncare</h2> \n<p>People are more interested than ever in studying and learning how sunlight rays can affect their skin, especially with the prevalence of skin cancer and other conditions. Such a concern is one of the biggest growth drivers of the suncare market.</p> \n<p>In 2020, the global market size for suncare products reachedUS$ 10.7 billion. It\u2019s also projected to rise at a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2021 to 2028. And among the many categories in this industry, adult suncare products share the biggest revenue at 69.4% of the 2020 market size.</p> \n<p>These products are bought mainly because of their innovative combinations, such as those infused with vitamin serums that protect against skin discoloration and wrinkles. Consumers also pay attention to a product\u2019singredients, which might be driven by emerging mindsets that advocate for cruelty-free and eco-friendly production.</p> \n<p>In addition to this, there is also growth in the suncare segment that caters to those with darker skin tones. Products that blend well with all skin colors are being developed as misconceptions about dark skin\u2019s melanin content are being debunked. This also opens new opportunities given the untapped potential of the BIPOC market.</p> \n<h2>4 trends in BIPOC suncare</h2> \n<h3>1. Debunking myths</h3> \n<p>Did you know that roughly 65% of African-Americans suffer from hyperpigmentation, which is often worsened by sun exposure without wearing asunscreen lotion?</p> \n<p>Despite common misconceptions, darker skin tones rich in melanin are not immune to sun damage. While melanin can provide some natural protection by blocking some UV rays, it only provides an SPF of 15, leaving all individuals vulnerable to skin cancer and damage from the sun\u2019s radiation.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding regarding sun protection among people of color, with studies showing that around47%of dermatology practitioners lack the knowledge and skills to address skin-related issues in Black individuals.</p> \n<p>To address this knowledge gap, businesses and brands can leverage their authority on social media and other online platforms to spread awareness about the importance ofsun protection. It is important to provide credible information rather than simply creating sales-focused advertisements, as readers are becoming increasingly discerning in their information consumption.</p> \n<h3>2. Go transparent</h3> \n<p>For BIPOC individuals, selecting a mineral sunscreen can be challenging due to the white cast left on their skin. This refers to the prominent sheen of the same color left on the skin after applying the cream, which is often caused by titanium oxide commonly found in manysunscreens.</p> \n<p>To address this issue, the trend towards transparent sunscreens aims to provide a non-greasy, chemical-based option that finishes with a translucent look. This allows individuals of all skin tones to wear sun protection without the unsightly white cast.</p> \n<p>Another effective solution is to offer tinted sun creams, which can be matched to an individual\u2019s specific skin tone. Offering a wide range of skin color options is essential in ensuring success with this approach.</p> \n<p>By offering a selection of transparent andtinted sun creams, businesses can cater to the unique needs of the BIPOC community and provide effective and practical sun protection options that promote skin health and wellness.</p> \n<h3>3. Embrace products that offer skin benefits</h3> \n<p>One of the most significanttrends in the beautyindustry is the rise of \u201cskintellectuals\u201d \u2013 individuals who are knowledgeable about their products and are increasingly focused on finding multifunctional skincare solutions. This trend is especially relevant to the BIPOC suncare segment, where consumers seek sun protection products that provide additional benefits beyond basic sun protection.</p> \n<p>Examples of these benefits include reducing pigmentation, improving moisturizing effects,minimizing wrinkles, and similar outcomes. These benefits can be incorporated into a wide range of products, including topicals,SPF lip balms, and face powders.</p> \n<p>When developing these products, you must ensure that your offerings cater to an all-inclusive skin tone gamut to meet your customer\u2019s needs. Tone-matching products can also bring about a better experience for your clients, ensuring they can find the ideal solution for their unique skin type and tone.</p> \n<p>By distributing multifunctional skincare products that cater to the unique needs of the BIPOC community, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and provide the best possible suncare solutions to their customers.</p> \n<h3>4. Celebrity appeal</h3> \n<p>In today\u2019s world, online personalities, celebrities, and individuals seen as authorities have a significant impact on the beauty industry, especially when it comes to suncare for the BIPOC community. These individuals can use their platform to inform and educate people, driving meaningful change in the industry.</p> \n<p>A prime example of this is American celebrity Rihanna\u2019s brand, Fenty Skin, which promotes all-inclusive personal care that emphasizes the importance of skincare and sun protection. Other brands can follow suit by identifying gaps in the current market, offering proper BIPOC representation, and educating their community about the importance of suncare for both aesthetic and health reasons.</p> \n<p>For example, you could begin by explaining the differences between SPF 30 andSPF 50, and continue building value from there. You can also promote other movements such as anti-cruelty and clean-and-green drives by offeringvegan sunscreenand related products.</p> \n<p>By leveraging the power of influencers, providing valuable educational content, and offering all-inclusive, sustainable products, brands can effectively cater to the needs of the BIPOC community and establish themselves as industry leaders.</p> \n<h2>Embracing BIPOC suncare</h2> \n<p>Sunscreen is for all \u2014 it\u2019s that simple.

Offeringgood sunscreenand chemical peels would also complete your catalog.</p> \n<h3>6. Stretching limitations</h3> \n<p>Creativity is the hot thing nowadays, especially among Gen Z.

TheJ-haircaremarket was valued atUS $1.7 billionin 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.63% between 2023 to 2027. APAC is predicted to be the largest haircare market by 2024, reachingUS $38.4 billion.</p> \n<p>This article examines the key features of J-haircare and highlights the opportunities for brands in this space.</p> \n<h2>5 top J-haircare trends</h2> \n<h3>1. Scalp health: skin-first approach</h3> \n<p>Many consumers will take a skin-first approach, swapping products with harsh ingredients for milder alternatives that nourish the scalp. Japanese haircare uses gentle formulas in all their products, regardless of the consumer\u2019s hair type or age. For instance, the products may contain natural botanical oils that soothe and nurture the scalp.</p> \n<p>Products for oily scalps are formulated with unique moisture-absorbing properties to regulate sebum production. A popular Japanese hair serum for oily scalp contains a moisture-locking formula that aims to balance the moisture level rather than stripping the oil. Most of the ingredients used in such products are organic, sulfate-free, and intended for use by the entire family.</p> \n<p>Other brands incorporate centuries-old Japanese beauty traditions into theirhaircare, such as probiotic-rich sake water and willow bark extract, both of which have been shown to improve blood circulation and promote hair growth. Others provide personalized services such as a combination of shampoos, oils, and creams to meet unique hair needs.</p> \n<p>More brands can capitalize on this trend by incorporating native Japanese ingredients and pantry staples with beauty benefits such as sake, sesame, soybeans, and ume in their products.</p> \n<h3>2. Easy and minimalistic hair care solutions</h3> \n<p>Multifunctional products with fuss-free applications will appeal to consumers seeking quick and convenient solutions. This will include leave-in hair masks and hair repair oils that can be washed off immediately to get salon-like results. For example, one Japanese brand sells a two-in-one conditioner and hair mask with a 5-minute leave-in time.</p> \n<p>More consumers will adopt a \u201cskinimalist\u201d approach, seeking all-in-one treatment options. Many well-known brands are responding by offering spray-on lotion that instantly revitalizes the scalp. Some offer exotic lavender and peppermint oil that simulate the feel ofshampooing. Additionally, root touch-ups to cover gray hair on the go are also popular.</p> \n<p>Brands should prioritize ingredients that restore the texture of damaged hair caused by UV rays, perming, and dyeing. They can incorporate rich ingredients such as argan and camellia seed into their formulas. Brands should also ensure that their products integrate seamlessly into consumers\u2019 existing routines, taking into account wait time and location.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, many J-brands are specifically designed for Asian hair and should broaden their range to accommodate different hair types such as afros.</p> \n<h3>3. Harnessing ancient hair rituals</h3> \n<p>One cultural phenomenon in Japan is the preference for long bathing routines that aid in relaxation. This routine entails applying scented oils to the hair for a calming effect. Many brands are capitalizing on these rituals by offering a line of creams andshampoosinspired by the concept of Japanese forest bathing. The products are intended to evoke imagery of forests, which it is sourced for their therapeutic properties.</p> \n<p>Taking inspiration from Japanese hot springs, many brands offer haircare with onsen water, which is rich in nutrients and treats the scalp. Additionally, customers can purchase hair brushes that mimic acupressure massage.\u00a0 Users can choose how much pressure to apply to their scalp to maximize relaxation. These products also come with warming serums designed to stimulate blood vessels on the scalp.</p> \n<p>More brands outside of Japan can draw inspiration from such Japanese regional rituals and modernize them to meet modern consumer needs. They can add natural ingredients like local flora or conventional medicines to their hair formulations to provide consumers with safe, gentle products that promote hair growth. However, brands must ensure that native ingredients are sourced responsibly and ethically.</p> \n<h3>4. Solutions for the aging population</h3> \n<p>Japan has one of the world\u2019s oldest populations, with the elderly constituting a sizable portion of its customer base. As a result, there is a huge market demand for anti-aging products, with even younger consumers showing interest.</p> \n<p>Many people experience age-related issues such as hair loss and thinning hair. According to Recruit Lifestyle,30%of people are anxious about hair loss and 20% are taking preventive measures. Brands can cater to this underserved market by providing a range of products with gentle formulations that help users embrace gray hair.</p> \n<p>Brands offer shampoo, conditioner, and treatment cream that gradually dye hair brown or black over time. POLA, for example, provides hair treatment shots containinghydratingingredients such as collagen, amino acids, ceramide, and ginseng to help nourish the scalp of the elderly. Other brands sell hair sprays that can instantly cover bald spots and cover up gray hair.</p> \n<h3>5. Salon-like services at home</h3> \n<p>Japan is world-renowned for its dedicated salon services, and many brands are capitalizing on this by offering products that provide salon-like services at home. These products or gadgets are designed to replicate salon results at home for a fraction of the cost.</p> \n<p>Consumers can now buy devices that deliver spa-quality J-treatments at home. One such product is ReFa\u2019s BeauTech which providesscalpmassages designed to mimic the feel of a beauty aesthetician\u2019s thumbs. Such products are waterproof, easy to use, maintenance-free, and relatively cheap.</p> \n<p>Brands have invested in R&D to develop patented LED combs that use ionic pulses to eliminate static electricity and restore the ion balance of hair. These products are designed to smoothen damaged hair and add moisture. Furthermore,hair dryersequipped with advanced technology that prevents hair from drying out and minimizes hair damage are also making waves in the market.</p> \n<p>Another popular trend in Japan is hair balm for men with permed hair. They are formulated to support chemically treated hair and contain ingredients like jojoba and argan oil which are known for their hydrating properties, while the wax enables users to create the desired hairstyles.</p> \n<h2>J-haircare trends in a nutshell</h2> \n<p>Because Japan has a larger presence of Gen X and boomers with high spending power, brands must prioritize their demands and offer products specifically tailored to their needs, such as anti-aging products.</p> \n<p>As more consumers become invested in skin care, brands must invest in wellness features such as SPS for scalp protection and hydrating hair oils that relieve stress.</p> \n<p>Brands investing in J-beauty should incorporate the essential principles of J-haircare into their products, which are simplicity, gentleness, and efficiency, all supported by science and technology.</p> \n<p>As the cost-of-living crisis worsens, brands should invest in products that provide salon-like services at home for a fraction of the price.</p> \n"}]}

Now, more women are embracing halal cosmetics. That\u2019s why thehalal beauty industrywill grow by 11.6% in 2023.</p> \n<p>Today, you can see halal beauty products everywhere, from Manhattan to South Korea. This means there\u2019s more global demand for halal beauty.</p> \n<p>But what does this mean for businesses? And how can you tap into the halal beauty market?</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of halal beautyImportant halal beauty practicesAction points for businessesConclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of halal beauty</h2> \n<p>Halal is an Arabic term describing anything that\u2019s permitted under Islamic Law. In beauty, products must follow certain production and manufacturing processes to be considered halal, and must contain only certain ingredients. For example, most animal products are banned in halal beauty products, or at least they must have been slaughtered according to Islamic Law.</p> \n<p>In addition, every ingredient must be traceable, so Islam has strict requirements for production and manufacturing processes.</p> \n<p>Even consumers who don\u2019t follow Islam are buying halal beauty products. These morals tie into those of the average consumer. They want to buy safe products that were ethically made and demand transparency from brands.</p> \n<h2>Important halal beauty practices</h2> \n<p>To create a halal beauty strategy, brands must know essential halal practices to offer the right products. These key points include products that are ethical and sustainable, contribute to physical health and self-care, and tie into Islamic holidays and traditions.</p> \n<h3>1. Caring for the hair and scalp</h3> \n<p>For Muslim women, wearing the hijab is an essential part of Islamic Law. The hijab covers a woman\u2019s hair, so she only shows that delicate part to her husband, family, and other women.</p> \n<p>However, the hijab can irritate the scalp, leading to hair loss. That\u2019s why hair and scalp products are crucial in halal beauty.</p> \n<p>Businesses can offershampoo and conditioner setsformulated with ingredients such as collagen. Hair loss occurs due to decreased collagen production in the body. As long as the collagen is plant-based or was derived from fish, this ingredient is allowed in halal beauty.</p> \n<h3>2. Ethical and sustainable</h3> \n<p>Halal beauty products must hold specific certifications to prove the products are clean and ethical. All halal beauty products must be vegan (or only contain specific animal ingredients), cruelty-free, and not contain harsh chemicals and alcohol.</p> \n<p>Halal certifications also extend to sustainability. Packaging must hold halal certifications to ensure they\u2019re recyclable and reusable.</p> \n<p>Brands must not only match their product formulations and packaging to fit halal standards, but must also seek the right certifications. Since transparency is vital to halal practices, brands must ensure every ingredient and aspect of their supply chain is traceable to receive those certifications.</p> \n<h3>3. Self-care spaces</h3> \n<p>Self-care has been a massive trend in the West, but this practice isn\u2019t new in eastern cultures. Muslims have a high standard of personal hygiene \u2014 this applies to both men and women.</p> \n<p>Self-care home products are popular among all Islamic individuals, though these consumers demand products that enhance skin and hair health. Focus on sellingvegan skincare productsthat appeal to both men and women.</p> \n<p>Since more women work and earn money, the demand for female beauty products is increasing in halal spaces. For example, more brands are creatingwater-based halal nail polish.</p> \n<h3>4. Ramadan and Eid</h3> \n<p>Ramadan is a sacred time for Muslims. Daily fasting is strictly enforced from sunrise to sunset, lasting a month. Participants can\u2019t even drink water, which will leave their skin dehydrated.</p> \n<p>Before Ramadan, brands can sellhydrating creams and serumsso participants can still have healthy skin. Skin-loving ingredients such as probiotics are accepted in halal beauty as long as the products don\u2019t contain animal fat. As a precaution, it\u2019s best to sell vegan products.</p> \n<p>Islam also has other important holidays, such as Eid-al-Adha. While gift-giving isn\u2019t as common as with other holidays, more participants give gifts if they\u2019re invited to a loved one\u2019s home. This is an excellent opportunity for businesses to sell halal beauty products, such aslipsticks.</p> \n<h2>Action points for businesses</h2> \n<p>Halal beautywill only pose an opportunity if businesses are smart about their strategy. Here are some action points to remember:</p> \n<h3>Halal is global</h3> \n<p>There are over one-and-a-half billion Muslims in the world. Islam is growing in the West, but Muslims in these regions have difficulty finding products that fit their principles. Beauty companies in North America and Europe can attract a larger audience by following halal guidelines.</p> \n<h3>Faith and the environment</h3> \n<p>Islamic principles, animal welfare, and the environment go hand-in-hand. These are also ethics that general consumers follow, regardless of religion. Modern beauty businesses must be sustainable and ethical to meet consumer demands, offering transparency in every step of the supply chain.</p> \n<p>Brands can meet this demand by offering halal certifications in product formulations and packaging. For consumers who don\u2019t follow Islam, offer other labels that the general population understands, such as \u201cvegan\u201d and \u201crecyclable.\u201d</p> \n<h3>Significance of wellness</h3> \n<p>The Muslim faith emphasizes wellness, specifically self-care. Self-care is also a principle that non-Muslim millennials and Gen-Zers are embracing. Brands can sell self-care products that are halal-certified and also meet the demands of non-Muslim consumers.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Since the Islamic faith is expanding globally, more brands are reaching out to Muslim consumers. Forbeauty brands, this means selling halal beauty, skincare, and self-care products. Halal products must contain certain ingredients, be sustainable, and exercise transparency in all steps of the supply chain.</p> \n<p>Businesses will want to sell certain products, such as scalp and hair care, to prevent hijab-induced hair loss. Self-care products must also fit Islamic principles and be available to men and women. All ingredients and packaging must be ethical and sustainable. Brands should also consider critical Islamic holidays, such as Ramadan and Eid-al-Adha.</p> \n<p>The beauty sphere is changing, and businesses must keep up with the latest consumer demands.

There areserumsmade with bakuchiol as an active ingredient,vitamin C eye serums, andcollagen sleeping masks.</p> \n<h3>3. Adaptogens for hair and scalp</h3> \n<p>The average consumer wants to use a mix of natural ingredients and traditional remedies to boost hair growth. Certain adaptogenic ingredients, such asamla, have been shown to prevent hair loss because amla promotes the proliferation of hair follicle cells.</p> \n<p>Amla berry extract is also loaded withvitamin C, an antioxidant that boosts collagen levels. Lack of collagen is a symptom of hair loss, so amla can improve scalp health and possibly induce hair growth. Since vitamin C is an antioxidant, it also prevents the oxidative stress that contributes to hair loss. These are all reasons you should sellamla hair oilto your customers.</p> \n<h3>4. Holistic adaptogens</h3> \n<p>When adaptogens first emerged in the mainstream, they were sold as wellness supplements, herbs, tea, shakes, and smoothie products. Now, this holistic approach extends to skin health.</p> \n<p>People care about the products they use, not just what they eat, but what they also put on their skin and hair. That\u2019s why modern beauty enthusiasts want to use products made with holistic ingredients, such as leaf extract, ginseng, and blue spirulina.</p> \n<p>Ginseng is an example of an ingredient that consumers demand. This short plant is an anti-aging ingredient that can improve tired-looking skin. Brands can sellhair growth productsandskincare setsformulated with ginseng.</p> \n<p>Sea buckthorn is another example. The fruit, flowers, leaf extract, and seeds all have medicinal purposes. Sea buckthorn comprises essential fatty acids, making this a powerful ingredient to use inskincare creams and serums.</p> \n<h2>Action points for businesses</h2> \n<p>Selling adaptogenic herbs in beauty may not be enough to gain sales. Businesses should follow certain action points to meet consumer demands.</p> \n<h3>Go beyond tradition</h3> \n<p>Even though adaptogens date back thousands of years, businesses must embrace innovation. Use formulas that leverage adaptogens in new ways. For example, multitasking makeup products made with high concentrations of skincare adaptogens will enhance the appearance and also treat skin conditions.</p> \n<h3>Educate</h3> \n<p>The science behind adaptogens is complex. People may want to learn more about natural beauty, but don\u2019t know where to start. Businesses can educate customers on adaptogens, specifically their physical benefits and uses. This builds trust and will improve a business\u2019s brand.</p> \n<h3>Adopt transparency</h3> \n<p>Usingnatural ingredientsisn\u2019t enough to satisfy customers. Consumers are shopping with sustainability in mind and demand cruelty-free and vegan products. They will only support businesses that abide by these principles.</p> \n<p>The modern consumer wants full transparency from brands, knowing where businesses source their ingredients and if they source them ethically. Customers also want to know how these ingredients are used in the production process, ensuring their products are free of preservatives.</p> \n<p>The best way to appease this demand is by offering transparency. Businesses should share where they\u2019re sourcing ingredients and offer a look into their supply chain. This information can easily be available at a storefront or website.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Adaptogen beauty is becoming one of the biggest trends in natural and clean beauty.</p> \n<p>Businesses should sell products with powerful elevated and holistic adaptogens, such as blue spirulina. Specific adaptogens, such as turmeric, are trending more than others. Adaptogens such as amla berry extract are also popular in the hair and scalp health markets, combatting hair loss and other issues.</p> \n<p>Businesses should always know the latest beauty trends to satisfy customer demand.

This includes paying more attention to sexual wellness as reflected in quite a few worldwide recent studies.</p> \n<p>Theglobal sexual wellness marketin 2021 was estimated at USD $80.1 billion and is expected to increase with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% from 2022 to 2030, hitting USD $121.6 billion by 2030. At the same time, separate research reported an estimation of USD $10.3 billion for thesexual wellness market size in the United Statesin 2021. Between 2022 to 2030, the market size of sexual wellness products among Americans is predicted to surge to 19.9 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 7.6%.</p> \n<p>While the growing incidence of HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is thought to be the propellant behind such a profitable increase in the US, the fact that it is an ever-growing competitive market that often faces constant product innovation and extensions is another driving force for its development. In the article that follows, let\u2019s take a closer look at the cutting-edge ideas and product expansions that may dominate in 2023.</p> \n<h2>Sexual wellness trends in 2023</h2> \n<h3>Hygiene focus</h3> \n<p>If people have learned nothing from all the health control and social distancing implementations in recent years, there is at least one thing thatmost people agree on\u2013 the importance of hygiene and sanitization. And of course, such trends have more or less extended to reproductive health products. This is proven by the increasing concerns of general consumers over their personal sexual hygiene. It was cited byindustry expertsas one of the most essential parts of safer sex practices that would drive the entire sexual wellness business growth.</p> \n<p>Female-targeted cleansers are one of the most common examples of such sexual hygiene products. In fact,female intimate washesfor private areas are nothing new. It has simply been elevated from its common odor removal, itchy or irritation relief role to new ways \u2013 towards a more health-conscious cleaning purpose. ApH-balanced feminine intimate cleanser, for example, may also serve as a bacteriostatic that helps to promote women\u2019s health,by preventing the growth of unwanted bacteriawhile protecting the beneficial bacteria.</p> \n<p>The intimate hygiene products cover a huge variety and are not limited to liquid form or only for women. It can come in the form of ananti-bacterial spray, with male users as the main target or it may also work as a1-time feminine wipethat contains a Vitamin E balance pH formula that provides instant sanitization to the private parts, such as the one shown in the picture below:</p> \n<h3>Skincare oriented</h3> \n<p>The skincare-oriented intimate care product is often presented as an extension of the intimate hygiene product. For instance, thisintimate essential oil moisturizeris not only used as a private part cleanser but also works as a nourishing moisturizer for the intimate parts, on top of having a faint flowery scent. Aunisex intimate area shower gel with skincareingredients such as rose extract and keratin is another example that combines the hygiene and skincare benefits together.</p> \n<p>While moisturizing is one of the main skincare concerns when it comes to skincare for skin dryness and irritation prevention,skin brightening creams for intimate sensitive partsand dark spot correctors for the intimate areas are in fact the main target products for most companies that focus on sexual wellness skincare products. It is rather common to findwhitening cream for a private area that contains collagen, which helps to boost for lightening skin around the intimate parts, such as the one shown in the picture below.</p> \n<p>There are also some cutting-edge skincare products for the private area that mix hydrating and brightening functionalities. One such good example is thismoisturizing brightening cream, while aT-mask shaped specifically for the intimate areaas featured in the image below, also maintains the same whitening and moisturizer effects.</p> \n<h3>Luxurious style</h3> \n<p>In addition to the huge rise in self-care and hygiene awareness, industry analysts also associate the growing concerns about sexual wellness with theincreased disposable incomeof the younger generations such as the millennials and Gen Z. The rise of income among the younger generations inevitably stimulates the pursuit not only for hotter sex but also for a more refined lifestyle and tastes for premium products with more luxurious, sophisticated designs.</p> \n<p>Such a desire creates a top trend with tremendous opportunities forfeminine hygiene natural productsthat promote entirely organic and natural ingredients with luxurious packaging. The growing number of women leading a more natural lifestyle and appreciating beautiful modern lifestyle products further enhances the prospect of such luxuriousall-natural ingredientsproducts.</p> \n<p>Another creative way launched by wholesalers and retailers in response to the demand for luxury and premium goods is to createa series of intimate care productsto provide a more holistic approach inclined value to the consumers. These products normally comprise a complete private care set including cleanser, nourishing gel, antibacterial cream, and more.</p> \n<p>The best thing about luxurious style for the sexual wellness product is that it is not restricted to certain product groups but can also be extended to any mood-enhancing or arousal-boosting products for sexual activities, which are essential in sexual mental health.Studies had shown that aphrodisiac scentssuch as lavender and black licorice were proven as the aroma that could arouse sexual desire or even increase sexual pleasure for a better sexual experience, thereby helping to improve sex life and mental well-being.</p> \n<p>As featured in the image below, anatural organic Osmanthus oil with an aphrodisiac aromais able to exude an arousing scent that helps in boosting pre and post-sex moods. To further pique the sexual mood, one may also consider achocolate aphrodisiac fragrance candlethat helps to promote the massage mood, thereby generating a relaxed olfactory sense to fuel and stimulate sexual desire.</p> \n<h2>Taboo no more</h2> \n<p>Worldwide\u2019s growing focus and attention onpersonal careand hygiene issues in the past few years, combined with the concerns over STDs have helped drive up the sexual wellness products demands as more active consumers are looking for safer sex. The three different product trends that any wholesalers interested in the sexual health field must not miss out in 2023 include hygiene focus products, skincare-oriented items, and those with luxurious styles. Although sexual wellness products used to be considered taboo and are relatively new with still a long way to go in coming years, until it\u2019s fully developed in the near future, the unstoppable growth in the sexual wellness field in 2023, however, is recognized by most analysts including ahighly authoritative multinational organization.

Fortune Business Insights predicts the global value of the sun care market will reach USD16.84 billion by 2027.</p> \n<p>Consumer attitudes to sun care have shifted due to more education about sun damage and skin cancer on social media \u2014#SunCarehas accumulated 94.5 million views on TikTok. The platform also supports sun safety by banning content that encourages tanning. Global skin cancer rates are expected to increase by11%by 2050, with the climate emergency and harmful UV rays rising. With the World Meteorological Organization stating heatwaves and record-breaking temperatures \u201care the new norm,\u201d sun protection is now a necessity and should be accessible to all.</p> \n<p>Greater awareness of the sun\u2019s impact on aging has seen suncare and skincare merge. According to the National Library of Medicine in the U.S.,80%of aging in caucasian skin is caused by sun exposure, and consumers who frequently use active skincare ingredients such as retinol and exfoliating acids are more prone to sun sensitivity.</p> \n<h2>Sun care around the world</h2> \n<p>Sun care has become a priority globally and is embedded into many people\u2019s regular skincare routines. That being said, regional beauty priorities and differing climates must be accounted for when formulating sun care products to ensure SPFs are comfortable and practical.</p> \n<p>According to Statista, sun care is expected to grow at a CAGR of7%from 2023 to 2027 in the Asia-Pacific. Barrier-protective solutions are trending throughout the region, focusing on protective outdoor solutions and microbiome-boosting ingredients.</p> \n<p>In India, attitudes toward sunscreen are shifting due to social media and increased awareness of the impacts of the sun. Rohit Chawl, founder and CEO of Innovist told Cosmetic Design-Asia that sun care is \u201cone of the top searched cosmetic and beauty products these days.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Africa, a new wave of indie brands is serving the growing number of beauty consumers. Cape Town-based SKOON describes itself as a natural, sustainable brand using local ingredients. Its SUNNYBONANI day defense sun cream with SPF 20 is a mineral-only-base sunscreen inspired by the African continent. More and more beauty brands are focused on providing specific sun care products for specific skin types andskin tones.</p> \n<p>In countries like Canada and the U.S., there can be a vast difference in consumer needs based on widely differing climates. Brands can go beyond SPFs with solutions that help people combat weather and external aggressors specific to their geographical area, including cold weather and wind. Consumers seek products that protect againstextreme heat,colder winters, heavier rains, and drought.</p> \n<p>After-sun care also presents an area for growth within the sun care beauty market. Soothing and moisture-locking ingredients such asaloe veraand richantioxidantswill help calm and nourish compromised skin.</p> \n<h2>Budget-friendly protection</h2> \n<p>The widespread economic crisis and the rising cost of living have increased hygiene poverty. Families on tight incomes are forced to forgo sun protection to buy everyday necessities, putting themselves at risk of future illnesses.</p> \n<p>Customer demands for budget-friendly products have evolved. Family-friendly sun care formulations that the entire family can use will be a must, alongside money-saving strategies such as bulk discounts or free shipping.</p> \n<p>Some brands have participated in raising awareness about hygiene poverty and donated sun care products to children, such as the #SunPoverty campaign in the UK in 2021.</p> \n<h2>Hybrid sun care</h2> \n<p>Serum formats are growing in popularity thanks to their multitasking appeal, comfortable texture, and lightweight application. The more sun care products can be combined with other skin care formulations, the more they appeal to the busy consumer. Conversely, sun care products imbued with skincare benefits will appeal to consistent daily sunscreen users. Modern multifunctional SPF products combine sun protection with beauty benefits such as firming andhydration. Yet, brands are forward-thinking to include other benefits such asprotecting against breakoutsandblocking dark spots.</p> \n<p>As sun protection becomes embedded in skin care andmake-uphybrids, ensure formulations are suitable for all skin tones and don\u2019t leave a white cast on darker skin.</p> \n<p>Additionally, targeting specific skin issues and conditions can set your formula apart. For example,sun care for acneis a growing opportunity, as traditional formats are often seen as greasy or pore-blocking.</p> \n<h2>Snackable sun care solutions</h2> \n<p>Application is one of the most significant barriers to regular sun care usage. Alternative applications and on-the-go sizes will make it easier for people to maintain their sun care habits no matter where they are. As more consumers adopt flexi-lifestyles, portable and easy-to-use sun care will be sought after, fromsticksolutions topowdersandmists.</p> \n<h2>Sun care beyond the face</h2> \n<p>As education and awareness grow around sun care, formulas beyond the face will be welcomed in additional beauty categories.</p> \n<p>Interest inhand carehas become more prominent in the post-pandemic era. The hands are prone to sun damage as an area regularly exposed to UV rays. Suncare for hands should focus onhigh SPFandwater resistance. Additionally, consumers seek products that treat dry hands with soothing ingredients likeshea butter,coconut oil, and/oraloe vera.</p> \n<p>Hair healthhas become a critical consumer priority, with protective scalp formulations being essential in hair care. The rise in mist products is impacting the category alongside scalp-specific solutions.Hair miststhat nourish and protect the scalp from the sun without weighing down hair will appeal to consumers. In head care, SPF is essential for bald and balding consumers.</p> \n<p>With the lines between health and beauty blurring, take a 360-degree approach to sun protection and care.</p> \n<h2>The future of sun care</h2> \n<p>Consumers are realizing the importance of regular skin protection; however, sun care may still be tedious or inaccessible. Additionally, even though consumer attitudes have shifted, misinformation and misunderstandings continue about the frequency of application and why it is required all year round, indoors and outdoors.</p> \n<p>With SPF considered a basic necessity, it\u2019s important to have affordable and accessible options for everyone. Ensure products come in sizes to suit all budgets, such as family-friendly supersize.</p> \n<p>Hybrid products and easy-to-use formats will appeal to the busy consumer. Hybrid products that include SPF as part of daily skincare will be seen as smart, efficient, and cost-effective. And formats such as sticks, powders and mists that offer an easy application for people on the go are a must.</p> \n"}]}

The UN predicts that by 2025, approximately two-thirds of the population will be living in water-stressed conditions. Solid beauty formulations, which either remove water or ask customers to add water at home, will appeal to people worried about their water usage and environmental footprint or who live in areas where water is less accessible.13% of UK consumersand 15% of French consumers are interested in dry-use soap, bath and shower products. Solid beauty represented1% of total U.S. skincaresales.</p> \n<p>Amidst a cost-of-living crisis, the cost is another factor that drives consumer choices regarding beauty products. Removing water improves both the shelf-life of the products and the overall percentage of activeingredients.</p> \n<p>As the desire for solid formulations increases, the category is becoming more sophisticated through formats and formulations to meet the needs of the skintellectual consumer who demands product performance.

Beauty brands need to boast high-performance solid formulations to appeal to skintellectual consumers. Win over the skeptical skintellectual through consumer and clinical trials to prove efficacy. Also, consider offering miniature discovery sets to lead people to full-size products and appeal to the cost-conscious consumer.</p> \n<h2>Next generation in solid design</h2> \n<p>Innovation is driving an improved user experience with solid formats. Common complaints about hard-to-hold bars or non-foaming formulas are being addressed by brands looking to stand out in this crowded industry. Look beyond the traditional soap bar shape in the design process and consider how solid formats can best suit consumer lifestyle demands.</p> \n<p>Solid formats are looking toward balm-style products such as amoisturizing balmorsunscreen stick.</p> \n<p>When it comes to soaps, some consumers lean toward one-use foaming soap paper to avoid storage problems with solid formats \u2014 they can be usedat home in the shower, or on the go forhand washing.</p> \n<p>In designing solid formulations, it\u2019s also important to consider other accessibility needs; for example, holding a bar of soap. Consider soaps of different shapes or with rough,exfoliating edgesto make them easier to hold.</p> \n<h2>Bring your own water (BYOW) formulations</h2> \n<p>Bring your own water (BYOW) formats are more accessible to many consumers who seek environmentally-friendly options that don\u2019t differ hugely in user experience. Unlike solid bars that are warmed on the skin and loosened with a bit of water, waterless tablets, powders, or flakes are mixed with water by the customer at home. BYOW formats are still more environmentally friendly than traditional formats as the lighter weights and reduced packing help lower fuel emissions and costs in transportation.</p> \n<p>Here are some great BYOW formulations:</p> \n<p>\u2013Hand soap tablets</p> \n<p>\u2013Tooth-cleaning powder</p> \n<h2>Packaging</h2> \n<p>Solid products pose unique issues when it comes to packaging. A delicate product must be protected in transit, stored hygienically between uses, and meet consumers\u2019 sustainability demands. Many solid formats are housed in recycled and recyclable cardboard, but innovation in this area offers alternatives such as biodegradable packaging.</p> \n<p>To help make the transition to solids easy, bathroom storage solutions are crucial and must solve customer concerns about hygiene. Many consumers are hesitant to try solid formats due to concerns about cleanliness between uses. \u201cThe accessories are key to aesthetics, performance, and creating a luxury experience,\u201d founder ofSBTRCT, Ben Grace, told Vogue Business. Consider refillable packaging.</p> \n<h2>Solid formulations are the future</h2> \n<p>When creating solid formulations, use tried-and-tested active ingredients, conduct consumer trials, gain community reviews, and create sampling programs. Alongside high-performance solid formulations, take the time to educate your customer base. Help make the transition to solid formulations easy by using marketing channels to explain how to use and store products most effectively and the positive impact on the environment.</p> \n<p>While sustainability isn\u2019t the only factor driving consumer choice regarding solid formulations, beauty brands should still practice sustainability throughout the value chain. When positioning your solid formulations as sustainable, look across the board to ensure consistency \u2014 focus on ingredient sourcing, packaging, the supply chain, and the company\u2019s overall ethics. When it comes to packaging, invest in ergonomic, innovative designs and packing systems to help overcome common customer concerns.</p> \n<p>Solid formulations are the future of the beauty industry; make sure you are thinking about sustainability and how to support your customers in switching to high-performing solid formulations.</p> \n"}]}

A new wave of consumers and brands are fusing modern-day designs with traditional practices and local ingredients that honor its culture and enhance efficacy.</p> \n<p>The beauty style in Mexico is often associated withbold eyeliner,sharp brows, and definedlips. It celebrates the iconic Mexican-American style of the 1940s. That being said, lazy perfection styles are gaining traction, with influence from the rest of North America.</p> \n<p>Mexican beauty trends are also often influenced byK-beauty. Interest in K-beauty soared following the 2018 World Cup, and Mexico and Korea celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations in 2022. The K-beauty influence in Mexico is often dubbed theMexicorea effect.</p> \n<p>Mexico\u2019s hair health priorities tend to mirror those of Latin America. In Mexico City,50%of the population have curly hair, while73%of Mexicans report having a type-two curl pattern.Hydrating,strengthening, andgrowth-supportivebenefits are what consumers seek when it comes to hair care products in Mexico.</p> \n<p>The personal care category reigns in Mexico, as it is ranked one of thetop 10markets in the world. A growing interest in male grooming presents new opportunities, with shaving alone having a projected CAGR of4.70%between 2022 and 2027. This includesrazors,shaving cream,aftershave,beard moisturizer, andpre-shave creams. With the Mexican mustache being a cultural symbol, elevated products that address beard and shaving routines appeal to the image-conscious man.</p> \n<h3>Mexico: Beauty priorities and strategies</h3> \n<p>Mexico\u2019s history of medicinal practices and herbalism sets the foundation for its thriving interest in natural products. Ingredients derived from native plants are at the heart of formulations, such as calendula, copal, aloe vera, and avocado.</p> \n<p>In North America, Mexico is leading conversations around ethical beauty practices (they are the first country in North America toban animal testing). While people are more cautious in spending due to the rising cost of living,53%of eco-conscious Mexicans are willing to pay more for reusable or recycled packing.</p> \n<h2>Personalizing beauty for North American markets</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that what works for one country may not work for another, even if they appear to be similar markets (like Canada and the US). Focus on local shopping habits and appropriate messaging specific to each country.</p> \n<p>In North America, diversity and inclusion are non-negotiables, and sustainability is a significant priority. Expand your reach with personalized solutions and formulations catering to geographical needs, common beauty concerns, and local initiatives important to the local communities.</p> \n<p>At the same time, consider natural and local ingredients alongside more sustainable formats. For starters, vegan and cruelty-free certifications will appeal to North American consumers, as well as reduced or zero-waste when it comes to packaging.</p> \n"}]}

Products with ancient ingredients</h3> \n<p>Many consumers seek natural and ancient ingredients in theirbeauty productsbecause they believe these ingredients are safer, more gentle on their skin, and more sustainable and environmentally friendly.</p> \n<p>Ancient ingredients are often more sustainable and environmentally friendly than synthetic ones. Many of these ingredients are sourced from plants and other natural sources and are often grown using sustainable farming practices.</p> \n<p>Ancient ingredients also have a long history of use and have been traditionally used for their medicinal and cosmetic properties.</p> \n<p>For example, essential oils, plant extracts, andherbshave been used for centuries in traditional medicine and beauty rituals worldwide. These ingredients are often believed to have natural healing and nourishing properties and are thought to be safer and more gentle than synthetic chemicals.</p> \n<h3>2. Multifunctional makeup</h3> \n<p>Multifunctional makeup, also known as \u201cmulti-use\u201d or \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d makeup, refers to beauty products that can be used in more than one way. These can include products like color pigments that can be used on thelips,cheeks, and face, ormoisturizersthat can be used on the face and body.</p> \n<p>The popularity ofmultifunctional makeupis on the rise, particularly among consumers who are looking for more sustainable and cost-effective options.</p> \n<p>Using multifunctionalmakeupallows consumers to reduce packaging and waste, as they only need to purchase one product instead of multiple single-use products. In addition, multifunctional makeup is often more cost-effective, as consumers can get more use out of one product rather than having to buy multiple products for different purposes.</p> \n<p>In addition to its environmental and financial benefits, multifunctional makeup is also popular because it allows consumers to be more efficient in their beauty routines.</p> \n<p>With one product that can serve multiple purposes, consumers can save time and streamline their beauty routine, making it easier to get ready in the morning or touch up their makeup throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Overall, multifunctional makeup is a growing trend in the beauty industry and is likely to continue to be popular with consumers who are looking for sustainable, cost-effective, and efficient options.</p> \n<h3>3.

Be specific</h3> \n<p>The definition of sustainability can be blurred, as it encompasses a wide range of environmental, social, and economic factors.</p> \n<p>This can make it difficult for businesses to communicate what makes their products or operations sustainable clearly.</p> \n<p>Businesses need to be clear and transparent about their sustainability efforts so that consumers and stakeholders can understand exactly what is sustainable about the product or company. In fact, 15% of consumers in the U.S. and Europe say that sustainability information is more important than price.</p> \n<p>One way businesses can do this is by providing clear and concise information about their efforts. If their product is made fromrecyclable goodsor sourced from specificsustainable ingredientsthen this should be clearly depicted.</p> \n<p>This can include details about the materials and ingredients used in their products, their supply chain and manufacturing processes, and any other efforts they are taking to minimize their environmental impact and promote social and economic sustainability.</p> \n<h2>Moving towards sustainability</h2> \n<p>Sustainability practices are not going anywhere; in fact, they are only increasing.</p> \n<p>By understanding and embracing the four trends mentioned above, businesses can improve their reputation, minimize their environmental footprint, and save on production costs.

Read on for an in-depth breakdown of how your business can remain relevant even in troubling times.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe effects cost of living has on the beauty industry5 Important beauty strategies to watchStay relevant during inflation</p> \n<h2>The effects cost of living has on the beauty industry</h2> \n<p>In 2022, the Office for National Statistics reported that89%of the residents in the United Kingdom say their costs of living have increased. As such, it\u2019s noticeable that many consumers have less attention to their non-essential purchases.</p> \n<p>Not only in the UK but also in the United States,52% of adultssaid they were experiencing higher financial stress levels in 2022 than in the previous year. Some consumers say they are buying fewer beauty products. Also, 1 out of 10 people says that they have given up their beauty routine due to rising prices according toAvon UK.</p> \n<p>Today, consumers are either refusing to buy beauty products or looking for cheaper but effective alternatives. That\u2019s where businesses can fish for opportunities. Here are five essential strategies you ought to watch amidst waning purchasing intent for high-pricedbeauty items.</p> \n<h2>5 Important beauty strategies to watch</h2> \n<h3>Embracing dupes</h3> \n<p>People want quality and safety in their purchases but many cannot buy products from high-end brands nowadays. So, effective beauty products available at lower prices are becoming more enticing to many consumers.</p> \n<p>These products are commonly called \u201cdupes,\u201d which offer about the same quality as top brands but are cheaper. Note that they aren\u2019t knockoffs and fakes\u2014they are comparable substitutes to mainstream brands.</p> \n<p>What to do</p> \n<p>People are looking for products that promise good performance. So, as you adopt this strategy into your business, it\u2019s essential to emphasize the products\u2019 efficacy.</p> \n<p>You may highlight the items\u2019 shelf life, cost per usage, and full ingredients list.Concealersandlipstickare great examples where you can practice this.</p> \n<p>Product comparison is a key factor in this strategy, so you want to fully stress the edges of your products against other items on your brand and your competition. You can also build a \u201cgood, better, best\u201d range to give people more alternatives depending on their budget.</p> \n<h3>Community and transparency</h3> \n<p>People do know that creating sustainable supply chains costs a lot, and more so in ensuring that each product made is of high quality. So, communicating with your customers can be fruitful, especially when you put transparency at the forefront of your business.</p> \n<p>Increasing prices to maintain quality and maintaining prices by changing your product formula are two different methods to address rising manufacturing costs. Whichever you choose, it\u2019s crucial that you communicate to your customers clearly why you picked such a decision.</p> \n<p>What to do</p> \n<p>Present facts regarding any price changes you\u2019ve made. For example, you want to communicate why you chose synthetic materials instead of natural-derived ones in yourperfumes.</p> \n<p>Consumers can use their devices to access information online easily. They are aware of manufacturers\u2019 rising costs as inflation hits the economy. The key is that you communicate with them transparently.</p> \n<p>You can also give out coupons, discounts, and other perks to counterbalance the price increases. They also love it when they receive personalized offers, which you can create using the data gathered in your loyalty program.</p> \n<h3>Meeting values</h3> \n<p>Many consumers are torn between sustainable products and lower-priced non-sustainable alternatives. As they prioritize a money-saving mindset, they tend to switch to the latter type. But why can\u2019t products be sustainable and cheap at the same time?</p> \n<p>Sustainable productsare cheaper on the outlook, but this thinking needs to be communicated more. For example,beauty productsthat don\u2019t need water can help save consumers some money on their utility bills. Longer shelf life and efficient cost-per-usage ratios are other similar aspects.</p> \n<p>What to do</p> \n<p>Communication is key in this strategy, and you want to emphasize your products\u2019 sustainable benefits fully. You should focus on three aspects: extended shelf life, cost per usage, and recycling programs.</p> \n<p>Consumers don\u2019t want waste, which isn\u2019t friendly to both their pockets and the planet. Ensuring that every ounce of the product gets used up is therefore essential. This hits the need for extended product lifespan, guaranteeing that the products don\u2019t expire unused.</p> \n<h3>Hygiene for all</h3> \n<p>Did you know that 69% of the teachers in the U.S. noticed children with bad hygiene in 2021? As the cost of living rises, some parents can\u2019t provide for their children\u2019s basic hygiene necessities like shampoo, soap, toothpaste, and deodorant.</p> \n<p>This calls for family-friendly products\u2014those that can be used by every family member regardless of gender and age. Since the entire household can use the items, the need for multiple purchases with varying prices fades away.</p> \n<p>What to do</p> \n<p>Offer family-friendly products in family-sized portions. Because many people will be using the product, it\u2019s important that the amount also lasts long. Addingall-in-one formatslikeshampooand conditioner hybrids is a popular option.</p> \n<p>Also, consider the age range of your products. For example, you want to utilize easy-to-use containers to provide convenience to the young and elderly of a family. Using easily recognizable packaging is another key step.</p> \n<h3>Affordable indulgences</h3> \n<p>As financial issues arise, stress may also be more frequent among many individuals. This increases the importance of self-care and the products that go along with it. While people want to indulge themselves in self-care, they also consider that their purchases have to be wise and affordable.</p> \n<p>A good example of this is their choice ofmulti-purpose tint, which can be used on theirlips, cheeks, and other parts of the face. Some consumers love to get mini sizes of their favorite fragrances and cosmetics.</p> \n<p>What to do</p> \n<p>Offer products in smaller portions, allowing your customers to enjoy their beloved items at lower prices. If you\u2019re selling fragrances, you can offer decants and travel-friendly sets. You can also add relaxing scented candles and aromatherapy oils to your collection as they are bound to be popular in the upcoming years.</p> \n<p>Refillable formats are also worth considering. Premium skincare and fragrances bought in refillable pouches allow people to indulge themselves at more affordable levels. Ensuring beautiful packaging is also essential as they offer a luxurious feel at lower prices.</p> \n<h2>Stay relevant during inflation</h2> \n<p>Inflation and rising living costs make it hard for people to include beauty products in their budgets. Even so, there arestrategiesthat you can use to offer these beauty items at prices that they can accept.</p> \n<p>From offering cheaper but effective alternatives to providing affordable indulgences, these five strategies will help your business stay relevant during inflation.</p> \n"}]}

With inflation affecting the prices of many products and services worldwide, some consumers may feel they cannot afford their current skincare routine and are looking for ways to cut costs.</p> \n<p>In addition to being more affordable, faux skincare products may offer similar ingredients and formulations as more expensive options, appealing to consumers who are seeking to achieve a certain look or skincare goal but do not want to invest in more expensive products.</p> \n<p>Brands that focus on offering products with at-home hacks, such as DIYfacemasksand other treatments, may also be particularly appealing to consumers who are looking for an affordable and convenient way to achieve their desired skincare goals.</p> \n<p>As more and more consumers look for ways to save money on their skincare routine, the popularity of faux skincare products will likely continue to grow.</p> \n<h3>All-in-one minimal products</h3> \n<p>Minimal skincare, orsimplified skincare, refers to an approach to skincare that focuses on using fewer products with multi-functional benefits.</p> \n<p>This trend has gained popularity in recent years as more and more people are looking for ways to streamline theirskincare routine.</p> \n<p>One of the main reasons that minimal skincare products are trending with consumers is their multi-functionality. According to a survey by the NPD Group, multifunctionality is the second leading attribute that Europeans link with good value in skincare products. Consumers are increasingly seeking products that serve multiple purposes, such as a moisturizer with sunscreen or a cleanser that also exfoliates.</p> \n<p>By using fewer products with multiple benefits, people can simplify their skincare routine and avoid the need to purchase and use a large number of individual products.</p> \n<p>Brands offeringall-in-oneor packaged minimal skincare products may be particularly appealing to consumers looking for a more streamlined and convenient way to care for their skin. These products may include kits or sets that contain multiple products with multifunctional benefits, allowing people to achieve their desired skincare goals with fewer products.</p> \n<p>Overall, the trend towards minimal skincare is likely driven by convenience, efficiency, and value. As more and more people seek out products that can serve multiple purposes and simplify their skincare routine, the popularity of minimal skincare products will likely continue to grow.</p> \n<h2>Getting onboard with skincare trends</h2> \n<p>Getting on board with skincare trends can be a lucrative and rewarding opportunity for wholesalers and businesses.</p> \n<p>By staying up-to-date with the latest products, techniques, and routines, you can offer your clients a diverse and in-demand range of skincare products.</p> \n"}]}

Here\u2019s what businesses should know about beauty sleep and the products to sell.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of sleep time skincareSleep time skincare products to offerConclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of sleep time skincare</h2> \n<p>Sleep timeskincareis a nightly beauty routine designed to be used around or at bedtime. Nighttime is when yourskin best absorbs ingredients, making this routine effective and easy to implement.

Many of these products, such as sleep-support sprays, relax and help users fall asleep faster.</p> \n<h3>What this means for businesses</h3> \n<p>Sleep time skincare is a big opportunity for businesses. Overnight beauty products are becoming more abundant and are easy to market. Salespeople can educate consumers, saying the products are easy to add to an existing nighttime skincare routine.</p> \n<p>Many brands also create nighttime skincare kits, making it even easier for starters to create a sleep time beauty routine.

These products save time during a nighttime ritual, and users love waking up to a beautiful complexion.</p> \n<p>There are various examples of these products.Acne hydrocolloid patcheswill extract the excess oil and sebum from a pimple overnight, so users wake up to less-noticeable breakouts.

While perfume may be a luxury to some, it has become an essential part of the beauty routine for many.</p> \n<p>To stay relevant during this time,fragrancebrands and distributors need to increase the value of their products among consumers. From shrinking the product bottles to changing the technology, four trends will set your business apart during these crucial times.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market for fragrance4 important fragrance trendsGetting on board with fragrance trends</p> \n<h2>The market for fragrance</h2> \n<p>With inflation impacting the world\u2019s economy, people\u2019s living costs are getting higher and higher. As such, they may become reluctant to spend their hard-earned funds on beauty products like fragrances. Specifically, they are looking for more justifiable value in their scent purchases.</p> \n<p>In 2022, the global market for perfumes and fragrances was valued atUS $43.42 billionbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that it will reach US $70.17 billion in 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3%.</p> \n<p>Notable areas in the fragrance market include China, the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. Germany is also noteworthy in the European region.</p> \n<p>Light-scented fragrances, natural ingredients, and custom scents are gaining traction in today\u2019s global market. Advertising scents as a part of personal care encourages men to pay attention to their perfumes and strengthens women\u2019s demand for the said products.</p> \n<h2>Four important fragrance trends</h2> \n<p>Today\u2019s consumers want to help save the planet and appreciate scents in small, refillable bottles. With their spending habits affected by the rising costs of living, multipurpose fragrances with mood-boosting effects are becoming popular too.</p> \n<h3>1. Minimize the size</h3> \n<p>Modern consumers are focused on one thing: sustainability. With environmental awareness spreading among people, they are trying to also contribute to the movement. In fragrances, they find it wasteful to throw away the big perfume bottles once they\u2019ve been used up.</p> \n<p>Retailing the scents in smaller bottles allows you to offer \u201cmore affordable\u201d options to your customers. If you ensure to use recyclable containers, thesesmaller portionsare also easy to reuse or upcycle. This may also include decants, or perfume that has been poured into tiny portions from the original perfume bottle.</p> \n<p>You don\u2019t have to abandon full-sized bottles entirely. Some people may opt fortravel-friendly options, while others may have an extra budget for a big one. Instead, allowing your customers to choose their preferred bottle size is vital.</p> \n<h3>2. Have refillable options</h3> \n<p>In a bid to reduce their carbon footprint and environmental impact, more and more people practice reusing things that are still in good condition. Afragrance bottlecan certainly be reused if taken care of properly, and the problem is that mainstream scents come in crimped bottles \u2014 the top can\u2019t be opened for reuse.</p> \n<p>Some innovative brands are switching to reusable threaded bottles, which helps captivate their consumers\u2019 attention. A hidden benefit is that they can also save up on manufacturing costs for packaging.</p> \n<p>Another strategy to pair withrefillable bottlesis the lower pricing of refill pouches, which will make them attractive in the market. You can garner brand loyalty with the affordability of your products. It would also be great to include a well-designed funnel in your refillable options.</p> \n<h3>3. Provide multiple uses</h3> \n<p>Perceived value, or the value of a product from a consumer\u2019s opinion, is a key factor you need to consider in many industries. A great example of this is people\u2019s love for two-in-one, three-in-one, or any othermultipurpose product. They think it offers twice as much for almost the same price.</p> \n<p>In scents, another rising trend to follow is makingmultipurpose fragrances. Products that can be used directly on the skin, as a laundry scent, as an aromatherapy essential oil, or a bathing scent are bound to be popular.</p> \n<p>Such multipurpose scents also support the growing trend of personalization. For instance, they can use these products if they want to use a particular fragrance as their signature scent. Great products alongside this trend include hair and body care essentials, candles, and versatile fragrance oils.</p> \n<h3>4. Science-backed products</h3> \n<p>Did you know that some fragrances can affect yourmood and emotions? This isn\u2019t a myth, as some brands have implemented this approach in theirfragrances. In particular, they are working with neuroscientists to make these products.</p> \n<p>Regardless of how it works and whether the consumers would believe their claims, nothing is more effective than a tangible certification of science-backed statements. This would be important, especially when you\u2019re marketing specific products to have some therapeutic effects.</p> \n<p>An extensive scent collection is also critical in this trend, allowing your customers to mix and matchscents for personalization. Such products will appeal to people who want low-cost but functional fragrances.</p> \n<h2>Getting on board with fragrance trends</h2> \n<p>People are looking for value-for-money fragrances, especially with their purchasing ability being affected by rising living costs. Many brands today are switching to smaller perfume bottles, refillable options, multipurpose scents, and science-backed products. Hop onto these trends today to stay ahead of your competition.</p> \n"}]}

Also, it influences consumers\u2019 daily habits, and the crucial factors for choosing beauty cosmetics.</p> \n<p>For example, the current weather in Southeast Asia is more humid compared to the past. As a result, themakeupindustry switched things up by introducing a strict requirement for the waterproof feature.</p> \n<p>Also, it\u2019s normal for consumers to demand for skin care products that enhance skin endurance.

These ingredients are useful for strengthening the skin\u2019s defense system, boosting its adaptability to extreme weather conditions, and restoring elasticity & firmness.</p> \n<h3>Traceability and transparency</h3> \n<p>Traceability and transparency of ingredients is another trend that\u2019s making rounds. Therefore, most consumers want products with clear information on the package. So, as a seller, it\u2019s essential to be clear about including key details, like the ingredients, manufacture date, etc.</p> \n<p>Vimea-Biotech, a Vietnam company, is an excellent example that provides precise information about who planted and harvested the related raw material on their products. That way, consumers can trace the product to a specific farmer.</p> \n<p>Futher, this trend helps customers make a more informed decision by choosing the most suitable and safest products, like the variants made from natural materials. According to In-Cosmetics Asia, scientists are currently studying how to extract elements from grape vines, sesame, and soil in areas with the most diverse microorganisms and the purest air in the world.</p> \n<h3>Health to the skin</h3> \n<p>Health is a significant factor that affects customers\u2019 orders as it helps them discover potentially harmful ingredients and possible allergens like alcohol.

Among the fierce competition in the market catering to various customer demands, a new need has emerged. More people tend to use products that can cheer them up. In other words, consumers are ordering for unique products that can relieve stress.</p> \n<p>Consequently, unique fragrances are developed to enhance users\u2019 comfort. Also, some cosmetic ingredients focus on design to meet customers\u2019 demands to express their individuality and personality.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the latest news shows that the market is expecting an overall solution that can be applied to the hair, face, and body. For example, as more buyers want to fight hair loss caused by stress, more purchases are being made for thescalp.</p> \n<h3>Sustainability</h3> \n<p>Another rising trend is the growing importance of sustainability, where more customers recognize the harm brought to the environment by beauty brands. Therefore, organic, sustainable, biodegradable ingredients are preferred nowadays for ingredient innovation.</p> \n<p>Also, an international personal care ingredient community emphasized on the rise of theHalal Beautytrend. This trend is expected to stay in power, as the market is estimated to reach $52 billion by 2025. Not only can Halal products attract its targeted Muslim consumers, but it appeals to non-Muslim populations. Thus, it\u2019s time for sellers to embark on cruelty-free, vegan, and organic product choices.</p> \n<p>Packaging is another key portion of this trend. So,eco-friendly packagingare the way to go as they improve user experience and leave a positive impression. This helps increase the repurchase rate at a relatively low cost and investment.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In-Cosmetics Asia provides a collaborative platform for beauty companies to share the latest updates in the industry.

Read on to learn about the five key trends shaping the fragrance industry in 2023.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market for clean and green fragrance5 trends to watch in 2023Getting on board with clean and green fragrance</p> \n<h2>The market for clean and green fragrance</h2> \n<p>The clean and green fragrance has a vague definition, but a simple way to describe it is scents that focus on sustainable practices, ethical sourcing of ingredients, and planet-friendly processes.</p> \n<p>With increased awareness of clean fragrances, more and more people demand to know what goes into their scents.</p> \n<p>Since 2018, the sales of clean fragrances have increased by 14% as reported by the IFFS. This goes to show that transparency in terms of the ingredients is becoming a need in the current market.</p> \n<p>On a bigger scale, the prestige cosmetics & fragrances market is currently valued at $62.31 Billion USD in 2022 and predicts a 6.13% increase in CAGR by 2027.</p> \n<p>At a global level, the United States is the largest contributor to the current market revenue, which amounts to $11,560 Million USD. In terms of individual consumption in 2022, each person generates approximately $8.19 USD.</p> \n<h2>5 trends to watch in 2023</h2> \n<p>Some innovative companies are taking new paths in their fragrance businesses, where a few key concepts include waste reduction and transparency. They also explore greener alternatives to their current formulations. Here\u2019s how they started the five top fragrance industry trends in 2023.</p> \n<h3>Less is better</h3> \n<p>Whether a product is sustainable or not is now an important factor in today\u2019s market. People are considering the amount of waste that they will generate by using specific fragrances.</p> \n<p>A great example of this is skin minimalism, which is one of the newest personal care trends. The idea is to use just the right amount to keep theirskin healthyand glowing. In simpler words, their goal is to use only what is needed.</p> \n<p>Scents are heavily used in skin care products and appealing to people with such a mindset may bring new business directions.</p> \n<p>The \u201cless is better\u201d concept also applies to the usage ofnatural ingredients. Some brands choose to recycle wasted materials and turn them into luxury fragrances. This is also known as upcycling.</p> \n<p>For instance, a scent maker may use grapes from wine distilleries to make their products. This not only allows them to create pure formulations made with natural ingredients but also reduces the need to harvest more resources.</p> \n<h3>Transparency is key</h3> \n<p>Consumers want to know exactly what is in their fragrance and its purpose, so they have control over what they\u2019re putting on their clothing and skin.</p> \n<p>Consumers are looking for complete transparency and want companies that explain why they use specific ingredients in their products instead of more nature-friendly alternatives. This gives brands the opportunity to explain their standpoint and make their customers understand their current progress toward sustainability.</p> \n<p>Also, people have become aware that \u201cnature-friendly\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201call-natural.\u201d As such, ensuring that the materials are ethically sourced, eco-certified, andorganicis a key step. The use of planet-friendly packaging and refillable plastic-free bottles is important as well.</p> \n<h3>Connecting back to nature</h3> \n<p>People are also beginning to pay attention to their mental health, and one way to do it is to usearomatherapeutic products. Fragrances that make the users smell good and also calm their nerves have been making waves among scent buyers.</p> \n<p>Scents containing phytoncide, a tree oil scientifically proven to calm a person\u2019s nerves and body, are excellent examples of this. Together with smells that mimic those found in nature, the users can feel a whole calming experience. Easy-to-apply and all-natural mists are other examples.</p> \n<p>Emotionally based products that may boost moods in a person are also popular. For instance, some brands use musk to infuse aphrodisiac effects on their products. Of course, ensuring that these ingredients are vegan-friendly matters. Recall that harvesting musk is historically cruel to animals.</p> \n<h3>Fragrance to go</h3> \n<p>Portable scents that come inpocket-sized containershave been around for a long time. Although it\u2019s nothing new, modern brands found a new way to transform \u201cfragrance to go\u201d applications.</p> \n<p>Particularly, easy-to-use fragrances made with a solid oil base are becoming more popular among beginner buyers and younger customers.</p> \n<p>Such products typically need fewer components to create, reducing production waste. While these scents are simpler, those who wear them would still anticipate a high-end experience.</p> \n<p>Using refillable bottles for fluid fragrances is also a good way to practice sustainability.</p> \n<h3>There\u2019s room for learning</h3> \n<p>Customers are prone to misconceptions. For instance, they don\u2019t know that some all-natural formulations may not be as nature-friendly as they think. In such cases, synthetic ingredients can be better. They are sustainable as well since they\u2019re produced in laboratories.</p> \n<p>Active communication with buyers about the pros and cons of synthetic materials is a booming trend modern businesses take. They can explain the function of specific ingredients and why they\u2019re necessary for theirfragranceproducts.</p> \n<p>But consumers may avoid synthetics mainly because of health concerns. With safety as a top priority, certifications from organizations like Environmental Working Group (EWG) are helpful, as they mean that the products don\u2019t contain any harmful chemicals.</p> \n<h2>Getting on board with clean and green fragrance</h2> \n<p>Fragrances produced with great attention to environmental footprint are sought-after by many people. Although there\u2019s no clear definition of clean in the fragrance industry, it\u2019s simply defined as being sustainable, unharmful to the planet, and not wasteful.</p> \n<p>With scent buyers appreciating clean and green fragrances, it\u2019s time to get on board by switching to a business strategy that aligns with it.</p> \n"}]}

Here we will look at the hottest Japanese makeup trends defining 2023 and what you will need to achieve the look yourself, no matter where you are in the world.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket for Japanese makeupBack to the basicsBright, naturally thick eyebrowsBring on the blushBold eyes (and glitter)Plump natural lips</p> \n<h2>Market for Japanese makeup</h2> \n<p>In a time where anyone can view and purchase beauty products from anywhere around the world, Japanese cosmetics companies are considered some of the top beauty manufacturers and are popular amongst both domestic and international consumers.</p> \n<p>The beauty industry has grown exponentially on a global level due, in part, to social media trends. In 2022, the revenue in the Japanese beauty and personal care market amounted toUS$ 38.54 billion, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.33% from 2022 to 2027. Japanese consumers are known to value high-quality products, with women and men willing to spend that extra money on products that deliver results. Similar to the west, the increased health and sustainability awareness has made natural products and organic beauty products popular with Japanese consumers in recent years.</p> \n<p>With facemasks, the \u201cnatural no-make makeup look\u201d was popular during the pandemic, but in 2023, Japanese consumers will embrace a bolder, more colorful range of cosmetics. This colorful shift underscores a sense of celebration.</p> \n<p>With the rise in conversations surrounding diversity and inclusion, it is clear that these broad topics have also been infused into the beauty industry. The one-size-fits-all model is decidedly outdated in Japan. We now see a more personalized approach to beauty services that offer skin-tone matched color palettes. The focus is all on the individual consumer, and many emerging trends and innovations in the Japanese beauty industry are now based on this concept of personalized beauty.</p> \n<h2>Back to the basics</h2> \n<p>Japanese makeup trends have always focused on fresh, clean skin that aligns with a \u2018\u201cno makeup\u201d aesthetic. In Japanese, \u201ctranslucency\u201d is a word used to describe flawless and glowing skin. While in English, it doesn\u2019t translate so well because when thinking of beautiful, healthy skin, \u201ctranslucent\u201d likely isn\u2019t the first word that comes to mind. However, this term is meant to describe a glow-from-within. It\u2019s a supple skin look you may only think is possible in advertisements.</p> \n<p>Beyond skincare, which, of course, plays an essential role, the trick is to build up foundation coverage in thin layers to avoid cakiness and know the best areas of the face to highlight. Or useBB creamsas a lighter alternative to traditional foundation.</p> \n<p>When you think of \u201cglow,\u201d you might automatically think \u201cshiny,\u201d but shiny isn\u2019t what consumers are going for when it comes to makeup. \u201cGlow\u201d and \u201cshiny\u201d are different terms in the makeup world.</p> \n<p>To get the glow you\u2019re seeking,highlightwhere the light will naturally hit your face \u2014 the high points on your forehead, cheekbones, bridge of your nose, cupid\u2019s bow, and chin. Then powder the areas where your face naturally makes oils and appears shiny. Realistically, this is everywhere you don\u2019t apply highlighter; however, you don\u2019t want to over-apply, so press the brush into a few key areas;</p> \n<p>\u2013 The skin under the eyes</p> \n<p>\u2013 A line from your forehead to your chin down the bridge of your nose</p> \n<p>\u2013 Any other areas that typically get oily throughout the day</p> \n<p>Remember to use afluffy makeup brush, not the pad that likely comes with the face powder.</p> \n<p>Use a cream highlight to get the effortless glow and subtle look associated with Japanese makeup trends.</p> \n<h2>Bright, naturally thick eyebrows</h2> \n<p>In Japan, thicker, arched brows are in, which is a direct contrast to the straight brow trend that was the norm for several years. Thicker brows follow the direction of a more natural look, and more people spend less time trimming and plucking their eyebrows. Some are even seeking to create a thicker look than their natural brows \u2014 a more \u201cfeathered brow\u201d look.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re looking to add volume, considerbrow mascara, or if you\u2019re looking to add some thickness, use abrow pencil.</p> \n<h2>Bring on the blush</h2> \n<p>While Japan doesn\u2019t favor sharp contours or bronzed skin, they love a goodblush. The cheek blush is what Japanese girls don\u2019t mind going over a little with brighter colors. They often choose peach, coral, or lotus pinks, which are gentle but still radiant and outstanding. This unique characteristic of Japanese-style makeup is usually known as \u201cdrunk\u201d makeup.</p> \n<p>The key here is to apply blush little by little and evenly in a round shape on both the cheeks and under the eye areas until the color comes out in a natural harmonious tone on the face. You can also apply a little blush on the tip of your nose and spread it around the cheek areas to create a drunken cheek effect. Combined with the natural base makeup, rosy cheeks will brighten up your face and create a pure impression.</p> \n<p>Deep-colored blushes and nude blushes are also in for autumn. Use deep colors for a mature finish or a nude color like beige for a more modern look.</p> \n<p>Whether you\u2019re opting for a bright, summery peach or a deeper, more autumnal color, don\u2019t be shy with the blush this year.</p> \n<h2>Bold eyes (and glitter)</h2> \n<p>Eyes are the key to maximizing the trending autumn look. We\u2019re talking aboutvolumizing mascara(possibly false lashes),eyeliner, andcolored eyeshadowsto frame your eyes. While some may consider the autumn color palette bold, others may still consider it a more natural look.</p> \n<p>Some bolder looks stem from the Y2K fashion boom, which doesn\u2019t just apply to clothing. On top of a pop of color, add a layer ofglitterto achieve the nostalgic feel of the 00s. Japanese makeup trends have always included subtle, glittery makeup that looks wet under the light \u2014 this trend simply takes the usual glimmer up a notch. Pat the glitter on gently with your fingers or a flat brush over your eyelids and in the inner corners to brighten the eyes.</p> \n<p>Consider a blue-toned color for the eyes to achieve a distinctly 00s vibe. However, Japanese makeup is all about keeping things natural and minimal. When using color, Japanese makeup trends don\u2019t typically include vivid eyeshadows all over the eyelid. They like to apply color more subtly through colorfulmascaraorlinerinstead. The most popular eyeliner colors are pink, burgundy, and blue. Some eyeliners are alreadyglitteryand add some fun in one simple step.</p> \n<h2>Plump natural lips</h2> \n<p>Lipstick trends in the Japanese beauty industry often promote natural-looking lips, so bright reds are rarely used in everyday makeup. Japanese women love naturally plump lips with bright colors like tropical fruit. Refreshing, cute lip colors like coral, orange-red, and baby pink or lip gloss are still the top choices for a Japanese makeup style. Nude colors are also a familiar choice for a more mature look; think brown or plum to add a touch of autumn to your makeup look.</p> \n<p>To apply lipstick for the best effect:</p> \n<p>1. Applylip balmfirst.</p> \n<p>2. Apply lipstick evenly to the whole lip, or apply to the center of the lips, using a brush or your fingertip to spread it to the outer.</p> \n<p>3. Last, apply a little bit oflip glossfor a juicy, plump lip effect.</p> \n<p>Japanese lip tints are also popular Japanese beauty products.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>The Japanese beauty style simplifies the makeup steps to focus on a person\u2019s natural features; that\u2019s why this style of makeup impresses the beauty world. When it comes to Japanese makeup trends, there is usually not much shading on the face, and there is a preference to emphasize the eyes, cheeks, and lips instead. This type of makeup style appeals to the busy consumer who doesn\u2019t have the time to put on fancy makeup but still wants to look gorgeous. It\u2019s also great for young women and men who are just getting into makeup and aren\u2019t familiar with the more in-depth makeup processes or don\u2019t have the application skills.</p> \n<p>Beauty brands should consider these Japanese makeup trends when deciding which products to carry. People can be bold with their makeup while keeping it relatively simple to highlight their natural features.</p> \n"}]}

The demand fornaturalingredients will be marked by the need for more environmentally friendly and ethical components.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, rising inflation rates and supply chain shortages will impact ingredient supply, forcing brands to look for alternatives such as lab-grown varieties.</p> \n<p>Biotechnology will provide novel solutions, and skinhealthwill remain a top priority for many. As a result, science-backed ingredients sourced ethically and sustainably will have a high market potential.</p> \n<p>This article discusses the leading ingredients inskincareand glosses over eight trends that will influence product formulations and purchasing decisions in 2025.</p> \n<h2>Eight trends that will shape beauty care in 2025</h2> \n<h3>Sustainable initiatives: synthetic ingredients</h3> \n<p>Due to rising ecological concerns and the depletion of the Earth\u2019s natural resources, many ingredients used in cosmetics are currently under strain. Thus, synthetic ingredients that mimic natural elements will serve as an alternative and be at the fore of sustainableskincare.</p> \n<p>Many consumers, however, believe that synthetic ingredients are harmful. Brands must improve their narrative and offer products with artificial ingredients that have the same effect on theskinas natural ingredients. They can gain consumer trust by using ingredients that have been clinically proven to maintain the skin microbiome.</p> \n<p>Many companies have already jumped on board with this trend. For instance, the US brand Evolved offers cosmetics that have been clinically proven to improveskintexture, fine lines, and redness. Furthermore, Bioscience\u2019s Palmless is a palm oil substitute produced using fermentation biotechnology. It is safe to predict that lab-grown alternatives with claims backed by scientific evidence willthrive.</p> \n<p>As ingredient scarcity is a significant concern in manufacturing, brands can safeguard their operations by investing in biotechinnovations. Rather than simply substitutingnatural ingredients, they should consider more environmentally friendly synthetic alternatives.</p> \n<h3>Indigenous ingredients that celebrate ancient traditions</h3> \n<p>Indigenous ingredients that honor centuries-old traditions, sourced ethically and sustainably, are highly popular. Look into ingredients commonly used in celebratedbeautypractices, such as Ayurveda, African herbalism, and Chinese medicines, amplified by modern science.</p> \n<p>Many companies are harnessing green chemistry to maximize the potency of local ingredients and createnourishingskincare. For example, some brands have developed adaptive phytocompound tea technology using the Mauritius tea plant. Similarly, brands are capitalizing on the ancient Ayurvedic oiling ritual by offering products made of traditional,nutrient-richherb oils to promote hair growth.</p> \n<p>Brands can work with regional farming communities and their cooperatives to source theingredientsbecause ethical sourcing is non-negotiable. They can also honor long-standing traditions by showing respect for the history, the people, and the customs.</p> \n<h3>Microbiome-friendly ingredients</h3> \n<p>More consumers will prioritize their health, increasing demand for microbe-friendlyskincare. As more companies invest in microbiome technology, new probiotic strains addressing specific skin concerns will emerge.</p> \n<p>Brands can capitalize on this trend by using a focused strategy, and they can put it into action by associating theseingredientswith specific pathogenic bacteria. For example, a US brand offers shampoo that contains Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate, which can inhibit the growth of bacteria and aid in dandruff removal.</p> \n<p>Other companies are developing products that prevent the creation of odor-releasing enzymes within bacteria while not affecting the skin\u2019s natural microbiome. Gallin\u00e9e, a French brand, sells a serum with a proprietary ingredient intended to weaken acne strains and cleanse theskin.</p> \n<h3>Perennial plants</h3> \n<p>Many businesses need help sourcing ingredients for their products, and this scarcity is likely to persist due to climate change. Perennialplants, however, can withstand changing ecosystems and regenerate without difficulty. Moss and peat, two primeval plants, are emerging asyouth-promoting champions, and brands can capitalize on this trend.</p> \n<p>Brands are recognizing the benefits of primevalplantsand have started incorporating them into their products. For Instance, an Irish brand uses a 3,000-year-old herb known to have 300 times the antioxidant properties of the industry standard in its products.</p> \n<p>Some are pushing a moss extract that has been shown tohydrate, calm, and increase skin elasticity. Meanwhile, others use a UV-resistant fern that has been shown to strengthen the skin\u2019s cellular defense system, This fern has been around for millions of years.</p> \n<p>To ensure success, companies should refrain from sourcingingredientsfrom ecologically sensitive areas and disturbing the biosphere. They can take it a step further by investing in lab-grown variants.</p> \n<h3>Non-invasive skincare</h3> \n<p>Non-invasive procedures that mimic the effects of botox andplumpingwill continue to be popular. Alternative techniques that deliver the same outcomes as invasive procedures without the added expense or discomfort will catapult the market.</p> \n<p>Consumers will seek products that prioritize skin health, and many will be drawn to plant-basedactives. Some brands, for example, use a Sichuan pepper compound that is gentle on the skin and works to reduce wrinkles. Similarly, native Japanese ingredients such as arnica montana flower are widely used to plump breasts, lips, and skin over a few weeks.</p> \n<p>Prioritizeingredientsbacked by clinical studies and developed by trusted chemists to gain consumer trust. Accreditations are necessary to address worries about product safety.</p> \n<h3>Ingredients found in kitchens</h3> \n<p>Supply chain issues and climate crises will push brands to explore common household ingredients. More scientific research will be conducted on kitchen staples such as rice and grains, which will be accessible sources of plant-basedactives.</p> \n<p>Many brands use the extract of sweet potatoes as it is proven to improve skintextureand reduce inflammation. Furthermore, rice is clinically proven to aid cell regeneration and is commonly used in Asian skincare.</p> \n<p>While sourcing everyday pantryingredients, brands must ensure that they are not diverting resources away from the food industry. Instead, they can use byproducts or waste, like vegetables, that supermarkets reject due to their unappealing appearance.</p> \n<h3>Space-friendly formulations</h3> \n<p>Although space travel will be limited to the wealthy in the near future, space-proof ingredients that promoteskinhealth and youthfulness will be popular along with other NASA-inspired innovations.</p> \n<p>Brands can use the research done in the space to addressskinconcerns. Clariant offers a line of products that contain active ingredients influenced by NASA research on the impact of harsh environments on skin cells.</p> \n<p>Similarly, a British company sells a product developed in collaboration with scientists from a space program. Their product contains anantioxidantthat is said to encourage elastin and hyaluronic acid production at its best.</p> \n<h3>Floral nourishment</h3> \n<p>As demand for plant-based ingredients rises, more brands will look into flowers, known to be a rich source of active ingredients. Carnations and tulips, for example, are effective in increasingcollagenlevels. Roses are also said to have microbiome-balancing properties, which help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria and thus soothe acne-prone skin.</p> \n<p>Flowers have long been a favorite ingredient in skincare and cosmetics. Auxin, a plant hormone, is widely used in products because it stimulatescollagenproduction and contains antioxidants. Similarly, carnations are used in the Japanese brand\u2019s serums to boost type III collagen, which promotes skin endurance and elasticity.</p> \n<p>Cuttingflowers, however, has a significant negative impact on the environment. Brands should be mindful and source waste from the flower industry as a substitute. Finding by-products will not be a problem because 15% of theflowersthat reach US supermarkets are considered too damaged to be sold.</p> \n<h2>Ethical sourcing and sustainability will be non-negotiable</h2> \n<p>Invest in brands that value lab-grown ingredients and are devoted to environmental safety and protection. Clinical studies should validate any claims made by brands to reduce customer doubt.</p> \n<p>When using natural ingredients, brands must ensure that these are sourced ethically and without endangering the environment. It is best to choose ingredients that are easy to grow.</p> \n<p>Exploring common household ingredients is a good idea because they are high in antioxidants. Brands must, however, ensure that the ingredients are not taken from the food industry, resulting in shortages.</p> \n"}]}

To generate the most revenue, businesses should make and/or sell makeup and skincare products that align with the current consumer demands.</p> \n<p>With the new year approaching, it\u2019s important to discuss the latest beauty industry trends. What\u2019s unique about 2023 beauty trends is that we can expect to see these same looks in the next coming years. Here are the beauty trends that businesses can expect to see and some product recommendations.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of beauty trendsBeauty trends for 2023 and beyondConclusion</p> \n<h2>Overview of beauty trends</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s estimated that thebeauty industrywill grow by 3.5% yearly. That means the beauty market is profitable for various business ventures. However, businesses will only see their money\u2019s worth if they follow the latest beauty trends and makeup looks.</p> \n<p>To create these beauty trends, experts identify data points such as consumer demands, trending social media posts on Instagram and TikTok, celebrities such as Hailey Bieber, and anything that\u2019s happening in the business side of the beauty world.</p> \n<p>From there, beauty experts will decide if these trends will only mark popular looks for the following year, certain seasons, or beyond this timeframe.</p> \n<h3>What is inspiring 2023 beauty trends?</h3> \n<p>The biggest beauty trends will not only make waves in 2023 but will influence looks in the following years. 2023beauty trendswill put health at the forefront since beauty consumers demand beneficial ingredients. Transparency also relates to this; consumers want to know what\u2019s in their products and how these ingredients will affect their skin and hair.</p> \n<p>Beauty consumers also want to be realistic. Modern beauty trends embrace flaws rather than hide them.</p> \n<h2>Beauty trends for 2023 and beyond</h2> \n<p>The biggest beauty trends impacting the beauty experience include superfoods, embracing unsexy beauty, seed-to-skin, protecting the skin dermis, and moisturizing the hair with oil. Be sure to offer these products at your business.</p> \n<h3>Superfood ingredients</h3> \n<p>Superfoods are any food that\u2019s dense in nutrients. These foods also benefit the skin; while some may target specific problems such as aging symptoms, people with all skin types can use superfoods as active ingredients in their products.</p> \n<p>There are numerous skin superfoods, but sea moss is the most trending. Sea moss is a term used to describe seaweed and red algae. These foods are high in vitamins and nutrients, decreasing inflammation and reducing excess oiliness.</p> \n<p>Sea moss is a multi-tasking product and can be used for the face and body. Start by selling asea moss soapso users can experience all-over hydration and a daily vitamin boost.</p> \n<h3>Unsexy beauty</h3> \n<p>Today, beauty enthusiasts don\u2019t want brands to tell them how they should look. Instead, modern beauty enthusiasts want to accept their flaws and use products to empower themselves.</p> \n<p>One of the ways brands can do this is by addressing flaws that are \u201cunsexy.\u201d These include ingrown hairs, pimples, melasma, and even underboob sweat. When brands are honest about these flaws, it will make businesses look more realistic than judgmental.</p> \n<p>How can businesses address these flaws while still selling products? Marketing is the key. Sellacne face creamsas a way to keep skin moisturized while not causing breakouts, as opposed to using advertising messages such as \u201cacne treatment.\u201d Sellhydrocolloid patchesin different shapes and colors, focusing on the fun aspect of skincare.</p> \n<h3>Seed-to-skin</h3> \n<p>There is a higher demand forbrand transparency and clean beauty. A good way that businesses can meet this demand is by promoting seed-to-skin products. Much like farm-to-plate, seed-to-skin is an agricultural solution to both unsafe ingredients and supply chain issues.</p> \n<p>Utilizing local agricultural ingredients offers environmental benefits and makes it easier for consumers to trace them.</p> \n<p>Brands can follow this trend by using natural and easy-to-grow ingredients, such as aloe vera. This plant is readily available and offers various benefits. When used in a face mask,aloe veramoisturizes the skin, heals the skin barrier, and is also an anti-inflammatory agent.</p> \n<h3>Microbial and skin bacteria</h3> \n<p>Beauty brands often use terms such as \u201cantibacterial.\u201d This seems beneficial when in reality, the skin needs certain types of bacteria. Harsh antibacterial products can damage the bacteria needed for healthy skin. Repairing the dermis involves protecting the skin on a microbial level.</p> \n<p>Brands should sell products made of effective yet protective ingredients that won\u2019t damage necessary skin bacteria. Vitamin C is a common example. This ingredient is found naturally in the epidermal layer of the skin and supports various skin functions, such as collagen production.</p> \n<p>Vitamin C also benefits our skin microbiome, a major factor in maintaining skin health. Brands can sell various skincare products, such asmoisturizers and cleansers, powered by vitamin C.</p> \n<h3>Hair slugging</h3> \n<p>Hair slugging is when one applies oil to the ends or mid-length of the hair, then wraps the hair up in a sock or bonnet. This locks in moisture, making hair look and feel nourished. Hair slugging also makes hair look shiny. Certain oils repair the hair, decreasing damage and preventing hair loss.</p> \n<p>There are many oils that consumers can use.Argan oilis one of the most popular examples; it not only moisturizes the hair and scalp but protects the hair, reduces damage, prevents hair loss, and reduces breakage and split ends.</p> \n<p>Instead of oil, consumers can also opt for ahair mask. Hair masks make tresses feel moisturized and look shiny and reduce frizz, protect from damage, and strengthen each strand. Unlike oils, masks also don\u2019t sit on top of the hair and weigh it down.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Some beauty trends and makeup looks not only impact the industry in the new year but are expected to be long-term.</p> \n<p>In 2023, businesses should sell products made with superfoods, embrace transparency on an agricultural level, and protect the skin dermis. For hair beauty, consumers want to leave oils and masks on overnight to nourish their tresses. More consumers want to be honest about their flaws, embracing unsexy beauty.</p> \n<p>Businesses should always know the latest makeup trends and products to sell every year to keep up with consumer demands. You can find these updates and more on theBaba Blog.</p> \n"}]}

Since they are a fundamental element in personal health and hygiene,bath productshave evolved to accommodate consumers\u2019 different personal interests and needs. Bath and shower products have grown from simple scrubbing soaps to many other novel products, such as bath salts and gels.</p> \n<p>The trend of aromatherapy has supported the adoption of fragranced bathroom products. Several bath products like body washes and bath bombs are now infused with essential oils and floral scents for relaxation and mental wellness. Many essential oils have properties that significantly impact a person\u2019s mood.</p> \n<p>Specifically, the global bath bomb market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% between 2021 to 2030. Bath bombs tend to be used for relaxation and stress relief, driving their demand, especially on the heels of the pandemic. Bath bombs appeal to a broad group of consumers; in particular, the self-care market for men is increasing.</p> \n<p>Consumers also show an increased preference for products containing essential oils, particularly for relaxation. Additionally, the increasing trend of giving luxurious gifts is projected to boost the bath bomb market in the coming years.</p> \n<p>Social media has also influenced the self-care and bath product market.

They can also havenourishing ingredientsthat leave the skin feeling moisturized.</p> \n<p>The main ingredients used in bath bombs are a sodium bicarbonate base and a weak acid that are unreactive in a dry state but react when dissolved in water and produce their characteristic fizzing. The other ingredients vary considerably but often include scented ingredients and dye to impart color and a pleasant fragrance to bath water.</p> \n<p>While bath bombs are a fun sensory experience since they fizz as they dissolve in colors, they can also provide a mentally nourishing experience. A2018 studyfound bathing generally was more beneficial for mental health than routine showering and offered marked improvement in stress, fatigue, and depression. When you add the sensory experience ofaromatherapy, there are many other potential benefits.</p> \n<h2>What to look for in a bath bomb</h2> \n<p>Of course, not all bath bombs are made equal, so it\u2019s important to check the ingredients before purchasing. Seek out bath bombs with natural,organicingredients. Also, consider bath bombs with added ingredients that can be soothing and nourishing to the skin, such as oatmeal,Epsom salts, or moisturizing agents likeshea butteror cocoa butter.</p> \n<p>Fragrances can be a great benefit and provide aromatherapy. Fragrances like lavender, rose, and jasmine can help with relaxation, while bergamot and peppermint provide more energizing effects. That being said, strong fragrances can lead to skin irritation, so use ones that work for you (test them).</p> \n<p>Some people withsensitive skinmay want to avoid fragrances in the bath altogether; however, use them with caution and don\u2019t soak too long.</p> \n<h2>What to avoid in a bath bomb</h2> \n<p>We already mentioned seeking out bath bombs with natural ingredients, which implies avoiding ones with synthetic ingredients such as parabens that can lead to inflammation, irritation, and possible allergic reactions. Additionally, synthetic fragrances and chemicals can have similar impacts and cause undesired effects.</p> \n<p>While glitter can look fantastic in a bath bomb, it should be avoided. Glitter can be abrasive to the skin and a person\u2019s sensitive areas, and the micro scratches can lead to a secondary infection.</p> \n<p>Talcum powder should also be avoided as it can dry out the skin by impacting the body\u2019s natural oil production. There is also some evidence that it may lead toovarian cancer.</p> \n<h2>How to use bath bombs</h2> \n<p>While the process for using abath bombis quite simple, drop them into the bath water and watch them dissolve around you, there are a few things to consider since they can irritate the skin.</p> \n<p>Should you shower after using a bath bomb? Yes!</p> \n<p>Also, to avoid clogging your drain, ensure that you clean your drain after use by doing a quick vinegar rinse. Pour vinegar down the drain and leave it for a few minutes before running the water to rinse again.</p> \n<h2>Do bath bombs expire?</h2> \n<p>Like most other skincare products, bath bombs will eventually expire. While the lifespan of a bath bomb depends on several factors, such as the ingredients, formulation, and packaging, you can expect them to hold up for approximately a year.</p> \n<p>That being said, unless it\u2019s moldy or rotten, an expired bath bomb may not cause any harm; however, it might have passed its best before date and not dissolve or create the desired effect anymore.</p> \n<h2>Looking for a bubble bath?</h2> \n<p>While typicallybath bombssimply fizz and disperse color when dropped into the bath, some bath bombs produce bigger bubbles, similar to bubble bath so consumers can have the best of both worlds.</p> \n"}]}

In other words, they want to invest in prestigious hair products that will improve their hair health. This is why luxury hair product sales increased in major countries worldwide, even as much as 67% in the UK.</p> \n<p>Consumers want to use similar ingredients in skincare products on their hair, such as hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. Consumers also want similar hair benefits seen in skincare products.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s everything that businesses need to know about the skinification of hair health and how to offer these products to customers.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsSummary of the skinification of hairFactors influencing this trendIngredients to look forConclusion</p> \n<h2>Summary of the skinification of hair</h2> \n<p>Hair skinification is treating your hair the same way you treat your skin. \u201cSkinification\u201d was first used to describe makeup powered with skin-lovingingredients. With the current hair skinification movement, consumers want to approach hair care using products and ingredients for hair and scalp health.</p> \n<p>This need stems from the pandemic; since consumers weren\u2019t going out, they took the time to invest in products designed to make their health softer and shinier. Many people with the pandemic virus also sufferedtemporary hair loss, and even younger people started focusing on scalp care.</p> \n<p>Consumers are still changing their routines and hair products, focusing on products made with vitamins, oils, and antioxidants. This is a major change from previous years when consumers invested in products to achieve a certain hairstyle.</p> \n<p>This presents an ample opportunity for retail hair stores to offer various skinification hair products.</p> \n<h2>Factors influencing this trend</h2> \n<p>While the pandemic did influence this trend, social media is continuing the hair skinification movement. This trend is also more prevalent in certain regions compared to others.</p> \n<h3>Social media</h3> \n<p>There are a couple of reasons why skinification is prevalent on social media. Celebrities such asQueer EyestarJonathan Van Nessare amplifying the trend online, specifically on social media. Other beauty influencers and bloggers are leveraging social media to educate the masses on hair care, products, and ingredients.</p> \n<p>Millennials and Gen Zers are also becoming parents.

TikTok users also turn to the popular video platform to explain their hair care routines, hacks, alternatives, and product recommendations.</p> \n<h3>Region</h3> \n<p>Prestigious hair care products are most popular in the UK. The UK enforced strict lockdowns during the pandemic, which closed beauty salons. As a result, residents educated themselves on hair care and the ingredients they need for healthy hair.

Because of increasedskincareeducation, more Americans search for hair care ingredients, such as keratin and Vitamin E, when finding products.</p> \n<p>While hair skinification isn\u2019t as prevalent in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, this trend is also expected to grow.</p> \n<h2>Ingredients to look for</h2> \n<p>Certain ingredients are leveraging the hair skinification trend.Natural ingredients, nutrients, and moisturizing ingredients have the highest demand.</p> \n<h3>Natural ingredients</h3> \n<p>Natural ingredients can consist of various ingredients, such as aloe, different oil blends, and peppermint.

For example, biotin, iron, and Vitamin D entice hair growth, Vitamin C contains collagen properties that strengthen the hair, and zinc prevents hair breakage.</p> \n<p>Businesses can sellbiotin growth serums and oilsto help customers grow and strengthen their hair.</p> \n<h3>Moisturizers</h3> \n<p>Consumers can use popular moisturizing skincare ingredients, such as squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide, on their hair. These ingredients can restore hair health, reduce scalp inflammation, lock in moisture, and entice hair growth.</p> \n<p>There areglycerin shampoo and conditioner setsthat leave hair silky smooth.Hair treatmentsmade with hyaluronic acid can repair damaged hair. Additionally,niacinamide hair linescan repair damaged hair.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Hair skinification is caring for hair the same way one cares for their skin.

Now, hair companies are taking note and unleashing hair-loving products.</p> \n<p>Businesses can satisfy the hair skinification trend by selling products with powerful ingredients.

As a result, market players are increasing investment in research and development to discover new and effective product offerings.</p> \n<h2>Climate-adaptive formats for 2023</h2> \n<h3>Season-specific skincare</h3> \n<p>Consumers in temperate climates no longer believe skin remains static throughout the year and are instead changing their beauty routines with each season. Regions with temperate climates are characterized by relatively moderate mean annual temperatures, with the northern hemisphere known to transition to warmer and colder weather quicker than the southern hemisphere.</p> \n<p>Each season brings a different set of skin concerns, with consumers now looking for products tailored to weather changes throughout all four seasons. Businesses are advised to curate specific collections for local communities and climates or invest in climate-smart formulations that can adapt to different environments.</p> \n<p>Examples ofseasonal beautyinclude products with microhyaluronic acidthat adapt to humidity levels in the environment, or two-in-one cream andsun creamthat can dry without breaking down makeup.Exfoliating scrubswith hydrated silica particles also help transition from autumn to winter by exfoliating and strengthening skin barrier in preparation for dry cold weather climates.</p> \n<h3>Products for weather extremities</h3> \n<p>Non-temperate climates remain the same year-round, whether that be cold climate in the polar regions, hot and humid weather in the tropics, dry air in the desert, or greater UV exposure in the marine areas. These extreme weather conditions give rise to specific skin and hair concerns that are effectively addressed through products that nourish and protect.</p> \n<p>Consumers in humid climates can find relief in light gel textures,anti-humidity hairsprays, or deodorant and body lotion that absorb sweat quickly. Cabbage and radish are also ingredients that can combat temperature increase in skin to help reduce sebum and skin dehydration.

According toWGSN, 2022 experienced the hottest summer on record and growth of melanoma has risen threefold over the last four decades. As a result, SPF protection has become paramount to the beauty and personal care industry and sun care products with UV protection ofSPF100are growing in demand.</p> \n<p>Environmental aggressors are felt globally, which means businesses should adopt an inclusive and accessible mindset. Reef-safe SPFs can be made with cacao and carrots for both melanated and non-melanated skin. Furthermore, customers may look specifically for sunscreens withno white cast. No-waste products can also be created with solid stick sun care in biodegradable plastic-free cardboard packaging.</p> \n<h3>Climate-resistant skincare</h3> \n<p>Sunlight and extreme temperatures are known to affect the longevity of skincare products. As weather patterns become more erratic, consumers may look to products that do not spoil with changing climate and climate-related risks.</p> \n<p>Products that have undergone rigorous testing will be key to ensure formulas retain their performance in places with extreme heat or cold. Oven-stability testing can be performed at a consistent temperature of 46C and 70% humidity over a long period of time, while freeze-thaw testing should test the ability for skincare products to remain stable after freezing and melting.</p> \n<p>Freeze-dried formulasorwaterless formulationsare climate resistant and can prevent microbial growth to extend product shelf life between 2-20 years without the use of preservatives. Extremophile ingredients, such as algae, seaweed, and sugarcane, are known to sustain under harsh weather and conditions, whileanti-aging serummade with resilient ingredients like Jade Alga and green or brown microalgae can survive repeated cellular deformation. In terms of packaging, double-layer reflective vacuum bottles help protect against UV rays.</p> \n<h2>Prioritizing climate-adaptive products</h2> \n<p>The rising beauty trend of climate-adaptive formats for 2023 is a response to concerns over skin health amidst climate change and rising pollution. In temperate climates, consumers demand solutions that can assist them through all four seasons, while those in non-temperate regions look towards formulations that protect from the impact of extreme climate. There is also a focus on skincare products that can take action against environmental aggressors and withstand rigorous conditions to maintain shelf life.</p> \n<p>Consumers are prioritizing personalized skin protection solutions as concerns over skin health and weather conditions grow. A key consideration for businesses is to operate with an inclusive mindset using formulas that take into account region-specific concerns. Businesses are also advised to consider how product packaging can be designed to block out the harmful effects of external factors on ingredient integrity.</p> \n"}]}

Invest in cotton-based or towel wraps users can infuse with treatments when necessary.</p> \n<h3>INNOluxe</h3> \n<p>INNOluxe takes a different approach to haircare by utilizing protein technology to develop color-protectinghair masks. These products have designs delivering streamlined benefits from cortex to cuticle. The British brand developed an AminoBond Complex that uses multi-weight proteins to enrich the hair in all regions.</p> \n<p>INNOluxe adds this complex to all itshair masks, allowing smaller proteins to permeate & strengthen the hair\u2019s inner structure and higher weights to style and provide protective films. Maintaining and protecting hair color is this brand\u2019s primary motive.</p> \n<p>For instance, INNOluxe\u2019s #SAVED mask nourishes and hydrates the hair by combining the AminoBond Complex with olive oil, grapeseed & corn extracts, and baobab protein. This mixture also enhances and retains hair color.</p> \n<p>Following the footsteps of INNOluxe means businesses investing inhair maskswith sophisticated formulas and multi-use. Stray away from hair masks marketed as relaxing treats and focus on variants providing semi-permanent hair color with or without saloon visits.</p> \n<h3>VanaNaturals</h3> \n<p>Prioritizing pure botanicals in products for textured hair is VanaNaturals\u2019 specialty. The brand providesall-around treatmentsfor the user\u2019s scalp and hair follicles. Tapping into the thriving scalp care category makes the Cape Town-based brand different. Its product offerings include a range of natural hair masks for textured hair.</p> \n<p>One perfect example is VanaNaturals\u2019 \u201cMake Me Strong Deep Conditioning Hibiscus Mask.\u201d this product combines grapeseed, aloe vera, avocado oils, and argan. Thehair mask\u2019sformula is designed to revive damaged & dry hair while revealing soft, bouncy, and moisturized curls after use.</p> \n<p>In addition, the above product example contains black cumin oil, which helps to soothe the scalp and remove irritations\u2014because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal capabilities. Interestingly, the ingredient can also boost hair growth due to a naturally occurring reaction called thymoquinone. VanaNaturals also ensures the use of ethically-sourced, organic, and natural ingredients in all its product ranges.</p> \n<p>Sellers can look towardhaircare itemsdrawing inspiration from the skincare industry. Capitalize on product ranges like masks, scrubs, and serums, focusing on scalp treatment.</p> \n<h3>Braes</h3> \n<p>Braes is not the typical \u201call-natural\u201dhair carebrand. It focuses primarily on the local Egypt market, appealing to domestic consumers with natural formulas. The Cairo-based brand frequently engages on social media and even started a 30-day Ramadan Challenge to promote its hair mask offerings.</p> \n<p>A strong Instagram presence and a local appeal rest under this brand\u2019s belt. Braes deep conditioninghair maskhas a design suitable for all hair types but tailored to benefit curly hair. But that\u2019s not all. This brand attracts domestic consumers by leveraging regional celebrations and holidays.</p> \n<p>Sellers may consider stocking up on products catering to a specific local market. However, they must avoid appropriating traditions, holidays, and iconography for profits only. Invest initemswith the right message and product offerings.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Investing in products with scalp-friendly ingredients is one way to leverage the hair mask market. Before stocking up, ensure the hair masks have lightweight textures that won\u2019t weigh down the scalp.</p> \n<p>Embrace natural curls by opting for formulas that nourish all curl types, including 4C coils. Also, capitalize on products facilitating simple haircare routines. They should be able to replace conditioners and help reduce a complicated, multi-step process.</p> \n<p>Drawing inspiration from Bread Beauty Supply, Kocostar, INNOluxe, VanaNaturals, and Braes will help retailers maintain sustainable sales and profits in 2023.</p> \n"}]}

What started as scents from resins and woods burned at religious ceremonies has today transformed into an entire industry that continues to shift as the years pass.</p> \n<p>Consumers are seeking more than just a scent when they spray their fragrance; they\u2019re searching for an entire experience. This article will highlight the top five trends in the fragrance industry for 2023, so you can stay ahead of the curve.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe market for modern fragrance5 trends changing modern fragranceMoving toward modern fragrance</p> \n<h2>The market for modern fragrance</h2> \n<p>The perfume and fragrance market will see excellent growth in the upcoming years. It was valued atUSD 54.9 billionin 2019 and is predicted to rise to USD 75.8 billion by 2025, experiencing a CAGR of 5.52% from 2020-2025.</p> \n<p>Today\u2019s fragrances highlight self-expression and intimacy. Buyers, especially the youth, appreciate high-quality scents made with clean processes. The term \u201cclean\u201d has no clear definition in the current market. So, emerging brands make their stand by presenting their certifications and being as transparent as possible.</p> \n<p>Quality is still a valued aspect among fragrance buyers. In 2021, luxury scents swelled in terms of sales at 85% year over year. From the outlook, the market share of high-end fragrances grew from 2% to 10% of the total sales worldwide in the span of ten years.</p> \n<h2>5 trends changing modern fragrance</h2> \n<h3>Subversive and sustainable</h3> \n<p>Eco-friendly scents are soaring in popularity in today\u2019s global market. Many buyers like to opt for scents made with natural ingredients, as well asrecycled fragrances. In fact, the natural ingredients segment predicted a CAGR of 4.3% from 2020 to 2027.</p> \n<p>Sustainability in the fragrance industry also pays attention to where the raw ingredients come from. Currently, brands are switching to materials that are 100% recyclable, while animal-derived ingredients are being avoided and even banned in specific areas.</p> \n<p>Scent makers also try to minimize their production volume to reduce environmental impact. However, the actual perfume is not the only thing consumers are keeping a close eye on as they expect their packaging to be recyclable and sustainable as well.</p> \n<h3>A fresh approach</h3> \n<p>In this age where trends come and go, people have the desire to keep up with what\u2019s relevant. What better way to do so than with seasonal scents ineco-friendly bottles?</p> \n<p>These are produced in small amounts using only the ingredients available at the time. This also makes up for scent variations and keeps the buyers\u2019 attention hooked.</p> \n<p>Keeping production low means needing fewer resources. In simpler words, a scent maker will take less natural ingredients and run fragrance-making equipment for a shorter time. They also reduce travel time with fewer shipments needed. By limiting their moves, they leave a reduced environmental impact on the outlook.</p> \n<h3>A creative process</h3> \n<p>Younger buyers pay particular attention to individual expression. They appreciate scents that set them apart from the crowd or fit their taste and character. Fragrances that match their personality and uniqueness are perfect examples.</p> \n<p>One way modern brands take advantage of this is to transform pop culture into familiar scents and packaging designs. They try to stimulate a story or mood with their products.</p> \n<p>Think about what elegant dates in Paris feel like. Scents inspired by such a theme may arouse certain memories and feelings among buyers.</p> \n<p>Pop culture affects all people, so targeting the masses is much easier. Modern brands also use other forms like songs, poems, movies, and more in their creations.</p> \n<p>People tend to consider what their eyes can see, so the packaging design also matters. For example, advertising a perfume as a good fit for nights out would most likely be matched with a dark-themed design.Custom packagingplays a vital role in this regard.</p> \n<h3>Change of perception</h3> \n<p>Buyers want to know their fragrances in-depth. For instance, they may want to know every piece of ingredient that goes into their scents. But companies actually don\u2019t need to share their formulas because they\u2019re trade secrets.</p> \n<p>Conversely, emerging brands choose to be as transparent as they can be. Such a move is a way to assure their clients that their products are made ethically and environmentally friendly. If they\u2019re not, they should be clear on the why so consumers are able to make their own choice. Some brands also began to adopt blockchain technology for this goal.</p> \n<p>For example, blockchain technology can be used to track the sources of every ingredient that goes into theireco-friendly perfume bottles. Since the consumers are able to trace the products, the manufacturer is able to ensure that sustainability best practices are being enforced.</p> \n<h3>An intuitive approach</h3> \n<p>Individual expression goes way beyond getting fragrances that match their tastes. Some scent buyers may also want to control how their scents will turn out to be.</p> \n<p>To put it more clearly, they want to be the ones who mix and match the scents to capture the smell that they want.</p> \n<p>This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the buyers step into the manufacturing process. Rather, some brands decided to offer several fragrances in a set, which can be paired with one another depending on the users\u2019 preferences.</p> \n<p>Since these companies are letting people do their thing with the scents, being transparent with their ingredients was a necessary move. Whether because of health concerns or other reasons, providing an ethical roadmap to one\u2019s consumers is becoming the norm.</p> \n<p>This also lets them express their definition of clean fragrance, which doesn\u2019t only focus on the fluids but also on theeco-friendly packagingmaterials used. Defining the term \u201cclean\u201d can make or break one\u2019s brand, so ensuring that it goes to excellent standards is essential.</p> \n<h2>Moving toward modern fragrance</h2> \n<p>The modern fragrance industry focuses more on sustainability, clean manufacturing, transparency, and creative presentation. Scent buyers enjoy the intuitive and free mixing of their fragrances, letting them personalize the smell that they love and express their individuality.</p> \n<p>Ones made from natural ingredients are expected to see tangible growth in the upcoming years, especially with the demand for eco-friendly products among consumers.</p> \n<p>Keeping up with the voice of the crowd ensures that your business remains at the head of the game. Re-envisioning your business goals to the more sustainable modern fragrance industry not only makes it profitable but also healthy for the planet.</p> \n"}]}

Some cosmetics, like eyeshadow, saw modest growth during this time. But most of the makeup industry saw less revenue than in previous years. Now that people are leaving their homes regularly again, makeup is coming back into the everyday routine. The makeup industry was valued at over$300 billion in 2021, and revenue is expected to increase at a CAGR of over 5% between 2022 and 2029.</p> \n<p>The future of makeup will continue to be affected by the health crisis. Hygiene concerns increase the demand for clean makeup products and ingredients. Additionally, makeup will focus on highlighting natural facial features and taking better care of the consumers\u2019 skin. Many behaviors also changed in a post-pandemic society, including digital cosmetic purchases and virtual consultations.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, here is a list of the new makeup trends to focus on in 2024.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsClean color productsMakeup for menSkin-first cosmetics\u2018No-makeup\u2019 makeup looksThe return of blushSoft-sculping instead of contouringTravel-sized cosmeticsA new life for lipstick</p> \n<h3>Clean color products</h3> \n<p>Color-depositing makeup, like eyeshadow and lipstick, has long been known to use ingredients that aren\u2019t the best for the planet. Ingredients that add color to cosmetics, like micas and oxides, often contain heavy metals that present a problem when they enter the waterways.</p> \n<p>Brands will need to educate the customer about how their products are more environmentally friendly than others. Offering this information to the consumer will prove to be a valuable way to get brand loyalty. Moving forward, consumers will prioritize products that use cleaner and more natural colorants. Any ingredients that harm the earth when sourced or involve harmful and unethical mining processes should be replaced with more ethical synthetics whenever possible.</p> \n<h3>Makeup for men</h3> \n<p>There have been great strides in eliminating gender expectations in recent years, and 2024 will see even more concerning cosmetics. Men and male-presenting individuals found that they were able to safely experiment with makeup while staying indoors during the health crisis. As such, the demand for cosmetics within this demographic went up significantly during the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Men aren\u2019t just using cosmetics; they\u2019re also focusing more heavily on skincare and hygiene these days. Many men are no longer afraid to reach for a little concealer if they feel they need it.</p> \n<p>Certain cultures, such as Asian cultures, have normalized everyday makeup-wearing for men. In other places, men practice the \u2018no-makeup\u2019 makeup look. Consider the male audience when adding makeup and cosmetics to your storefront. They will become a more substantial part of your customer base in the coming years.</p> \n<h3>Skin-first cosmetics</h3> \n<p>Customers had increased concern about skincare while working from home, and now that people are returning to the office, this will become an even higher priority. Hygiene concerns will increase the desire for makeup that also acts like skincare. Many of these products will have hydrating properties, like hydrating lipsticks ormoisturizing foundations.</p> \n<p>Makeup that can double as skincare will be seen as a good financial investment by consumers, who will likely pay more for these products if they can multitask. Newer cosmetics are also prioritizing skin protection around the eye areas, with products likeSupergoop\u2019s shimmershadeoffering 30 SPF protection for consumers. Consider adding products to your storefront that emphasize skin health or offer to help certain skin conditions, like dry skin and acne.</p> \n<h3>\u2018No-makeup\u2019 makeup looks</h3> \n<p>Now that many more consumers are taking care of their skin, they\u2019ll be looking for products that allow them to show off their natural skin. Buyers will be looking for products that enhance their natural facial features, not ones that cover or change them. This new makeup trend will be dominated by multitasking, sheer products that let consumers\u2019 skin come through, likebuildable foundations.</p> \n<p>These formulas will be more buildable by nature, which will become a selling point for consumers who want to adjust their looks more naturally. Consumers will also be interested in makeup that can be applied all over the body, such as full-body foundations. Your storefront should offer plenty of products that will boost natural features instead of covering them up.</p> \n<h3>The return of blush</h3> \n<p>Blush was used sparingly in recent makeup trends, but in the next year, blush will reappear as a must-have cosmetic product. The placement of blush will also change, with consumers opting to use blush even higher up the cheekbone and around the eyes. Cosmetics will emphasize the C shape, making it visible even with a mask. Blush will also come in new formats, likestick blushandliquid blush, and these easy-to-use formulas will be favored over contouring moving forward.</p> \n<p>Younger cosmetic consumers will be drawn to new formulas and applications, such asstampable blushand adventurous blush colors. Consider adding more innovative formats and formulations for blush to your storefront, as well as classic blush compacts.</p> \n<h3>Soft-sculping instead of contouring</h3> \n<p>Contouring was the hottest new makeup trend before everyone went into lockdown. Moving forward, consumers will be practicing a new technique called \u2018soft-sculpting\u2019. Where contouring in the past called for harsh lines and sharp angles, soft sculpting is a much more relaxed form of cosmetic definition. The focus will transition from hiding flaws to enhancing facial features.</p> \n<p>Consumers will use products to accentuate and highlight their natural features, rather than attempt to change the shape of their faces. It will be easier for most consumers to practice, and the attainability of the soft sculpted look will also help its popularity. Soft-sculpting will be dominated byshimmer-free productsthat aim to glow rather than sparkle. Products that will do well in this category will include balsam,creams, and serums.</p> \n<h3>Travel-sized cosmetics</h3> \n<p>Now that consumers are traveling again, the desire for small cosmetics will increase as consumers don\u2019t want to be weighed down with makeup products. People will want to wear makeup during their trips, but they won\u2019t want to make space in their suitcases for full-sized products.</p> \n<p>This makeup trend will be defined by portability and multi-use potential. Any makeup items that have multiple purposes, such as stackable makeup packaging, will see an increase in demand. Some cosmetics are beginning to allow consumers tocustomize a small palettewith makeup products for the whole face, allowing consumers to create personalized and refillable palettes.</p> \n<h3>A new life for lipstick</h3> \n<p>Now that mask restrictions are easing around the world, we\u2019ll begin to seelipstickdemand take off as people celebrate and return to normal usage. Formulas that can stand up against daily mask-wearing and adjustments will be prioritized by consumers. Consumers will look for products that arelong-lasting, transfer-proof, and smudge-free; consider adding these items to your storefront for a sales boost.</p> \n<p>New makeup trends will see consumers looking for more creative ways to find the perfect shade. Personalized colors will be popular as technology will allow companies to makecolor-changing makeup based on pH. Technology will also give consumers more control over color customization at home with products like custom lipstick printers and AR-try-on tech.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>In this new era of makeup, consumer goals and priorities are going to shift from heavy makeup to more natural products. Consumers are going to be looking for products that offer clean and sustainably sourced ingredients without sacrificing color. New skincare and makeup trends will highlight natural features instead of hiding or reshaping them with cosmetics. Focusing on these areas will help ensure that your storefront is prepared for the next wave of makeup trends in 2024.</p> \n"}]}

With several green attributes, including their eco-friendly packaging, solid soaps pique consumers\u2019 interest in making sustainable choices.</p> \n<p>Skincare brands looking to ride this wave must consider the following industry trends to remain competitive.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket growth for the solid soap market5 solid soap trends to watchMoving forward</p> \n<h2>Market growth for the solid soap market</h2> \n<p>Skincare consumers\u2019 behavior toward beauty and personal care drives the demand for organic bar soaps. These soaps are also gaining popularity due to their versatility, portability, and immense skincare benefits.</p> \n<p>This growing adaptability made the global organic bar soap market reach a value of $1.83 billion in 2021. But, recent forecasts project it to grow at aCAGR of 8.2%from 2022 to 2030, with the Asia Pacific dominating the market with a 33.1% share of global revenue.</p> \n<h2>5 solid soap trends to watch</h2> \n<p>The following trends will give skincare brands a competitive edge and increase revenue;</p> \n<h3>1. Soap formulas that match consumers\u2019 needs</h3> \n<p>Some consumers want fair skin, a supple look, and a glow. In comparison, others want to treat skin conditions like acne, eczema, and wrinkles. Solid soaps with custom formulas can meet these various skin care needs.</p> \n<p>For example, natural ingredients like oats and honey are excellent for sensitive skin, and rose soaps are great for dry skin.</p> \n<p>Oatmeal treats acne and eczema by removing oil, dirt, and dead skin, thus reducing skin inflammation. Honey, too, is rich in antioxidants that prevent wrinkles, keeping the skin supple and fresh.</p> \n<p>In essence,oats and honey soapsare great remedies for skin hydration and rejuvenation.</p> \n<p>Rose soapscontain oil from rose petals, which have vitamins and minerals terrific for dry skin. These soaps soften and moisturize the skin, with the Vitamin C protecting it from harmful sun rays.</p> \n<p>By offering different formulations of soap ingredients, consumers can choose several options that best suit their needs, helping to improve their skincare routine. This provides an avenue for wholesalers to maximize profit with increased patronage.</p> \n<h3>2. Soaps rooted in local culture</h3> \n<p>Asia pacific dominated the organic bar soap market, so solid soap businesses can take advantage of their increasing demand to provide soaps rooted in their local culture. This can attract buy-ready consumers, giving these businesses a higher chance of market penetration.</p> \n<p>But they must understand the uses of these ingredients in their culture to communicate their benefits to consumers effectively.</p> \n<p>For example, soaps likerice milk soapandcharcoal soapare inspired by the rituals ofKorean bathhouse cultureand skincare routine.</p> \n<p>For years, Koreans have used rice milk in their skincare routines. Rice milk whitens the face and leaves a gentle glow. It also moisturizes and removes excess oil from the skin.</p> \n<p>Since Korean bathhouses use charcoal to detoxify, exfoliate and brighten the skin, skincare businesses should consider charcoal for its purifying properties for skin health.</p> \n<p>To increase revenue and offer a luxury beauty experience, infuse traditional wellness practices and local ingredients rooted in culture to promote your business.</p> \n<h3>3. Waterless and gentle facial soaps</h3> \n<p>Waterless face soapsare sustainable. Apart from using little to no water during production, they can be preserved with eco-friendly preservatives. They also tend to last longer, as a little goes a long way for people with intensive skincare routines.</p> \n<p>Gentle facial cleansing bars are also ideal for consumers with sensitive skin. They\u2019re popularly made withcastor oilandcoconut oilto prevent wrinkles, dryness, and acne.</p> \n<p>The moisturizing properties of coconut oil contribute to smooth, soft skin, providing B Vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Further, coconut oil supports wound healing and inhibits inflammation, making it a suitable treatment for irritated or stressed skin.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, castor oil contains ricinoleic acid, which helps fight acne-causing bacteria. It penetrates easily into the skin layer and makes it smooth and supple. The natural properties of castor oil make it a popular ingredient for gentle solid soap formulations.</p> \n<h3>4. Solid soaps for black skin</h3> \n<p>Black brands form only2.5% of the revenuein the beauty industry. Although the market is under-served, it creates a profitable opportunity for new businesses investing in soaps for black skin.</p> \n<p>Natural ingredients likeshea butterandaloe veraare suitable for black skin. Shea butter resists eczema, soothes burns, and gently fades scars. It also contains antioxidants that protect the skin from photoaging.</p> \n<p>Soaps for black skinare also made with aloe vera to relieve itchiness, soothe dry skin, and moisturize it for a healthy glow. It also kills bacteria and fungi, making it effective for people with various skin conditions like acne and eczema.</p> \n<p>Hence, soaps with aloe vera and shea butter can restore skin elasticity and vitality.</p> \n<p>Businesses must research and sell soaps with the right ingredients for black people to carve a name for their brand in this market. This will help them penetrate the black soap niche market and generate more revenue.</p> \n<h3>5. Solid soaps infused with supplement-based ingredients</h3> \n<p>According toScientific American, a person produces about 1% less collagen in the skin each year once they turn 20. As a result, the skin becomes thinner and more fragile with age. For this reason,collagen bar soapsare fantastic for replenishing moisture and improving skin elasticity.</p> \n<p>For example, fish collagens derived from fish skins, bones, and scales reduce wrinkles and cellulitis and prevent skin damage from free radicals.</p> \n<p>Plant-based products likepapaya soapsare rich in Vitamin C, stimulating collagen production in the skin and treating hyperpigmentation.</p> \n<p>Offer soaps that contain these health supplements to appeal to older consumers and boost sales. Also, pay special attention to soap manufacturers with less aggressive soap-making processes, as they better preserve natural ingredients making the soaps more effective.</p> \n<h2>Moving forward</h2> \n<p>To conclude, conventional soap is made with chemicals that harm the environment and our health. Solid soap bars, on the other hand, are eco-friendly, consume less electricity, and require less packaging.</p> \n<p>Many eco-friendly soap brands contain organic and natural ingredients, are chemical-free, and use thoughtful packaging.</p> \n<p>To follow the bar soap industry trends, focus on ideals and interests that matter the most to consumers. Along with being eco-conscious and maintaining a youthful look, some consumers also want to treat skincare issues.</p> \n<p>Research upcoming markets like the black soap niche to establish a strong market share and become the go-to brand for underserved communities.</p> \n"}]}

More people want to be expressive with their appearance and embrace the future with innovative beauty techniques. At the same time, more people prefer lockdown beauty regimens, focusing on minimalism with more emphasis on skincare.</p> \n<p>Inflation has also been striking the world. In the U.S., for example,the cost of consumer goodsrose by 0.4%. Beauty enthusiasts are trading luxury fragrances and expensive hair products for affordable items.</p> \n<p>Beauty consumers are also witnessing a transformation among makeup and personal care brands\u2014instead of appealing to a specific look or demographic, more companies are opting for being inclusive.\u00a0 This means that beauty brands must offer products that fit all ages, genders, skin types, and skin tones in order to meet consumer demands.</p> \n<p>Buyers also want to see inclusivity in advertising, highlighting different lifestyle, regional, and cultural aspects in these campaigns.</p> \n<p>Sustainability is no longer an option, but a must.

Some trends are conflicting; for example, expressionism and minimalism are big makeup looks for next year. Other trends are expected to stay for the long term, such as inclusivity and eco-friendliness.</p> \n<h3>Minimalism</h3> \n<p>The pandemic had a major impact on beauty routines\u2014or lack thereof. Because of widespread lockdowns, fewer people left their homes and they started working remotely. Few beauty enthusiasts wore makeup; if they did, it wasn\u2019t a lot. The pandemic also gave more people the opportunity to care for their skin and develop healthier beauty habits.</p> \n<p>Even though we\u2019re no longer in the midst of lockdowns, minimalist beauty is still popular. Self-care and self-love are massive movements, causing individuals to appreciate their natural beauty.</p> \n<p>There are still ways that beauty businesses can capitalize on minimalist beauty trends.

Multi-purpose products such ascheek and lip stainsadd natural color to the complexion and are quick enough to apply before a Zoom meeting.</p> \n<p>Some buyers will want to apply a full face of makeup but keep their look toned down. In this case, offer aneyeshadow palettefilled with neutral colors.</p> \n<h3>Expressionism</h3> \n<p>Even though minimalism is a massive trend, more people are also becoming fearless and expressing artistry with their makeup looks.

Asia Pacific and North America are expected to hold dominant positions on the regional level. Experts predict Asia Pacific will grow at a CAGR of 8.3%, while North America will expand at a CAGR of 10.5%.</p> \n<h2>5 K-beauty skincare beauty trends that will rock 2023</h2> \n<h3>Hair aware: new haircare priorities</h3> \n<p>Hair growth productsare top items that are always in demand. Many consumers fear hair loss, greying, and thinning, and brands are pushing innovations to counter these problems. In Asia Pacific, covering white or grey hair presents one of the most lucrative options for haircare items. Demands for hair coverage even surpass that of anti-hair fall collections.</p> \n<p>Anti-hair fall productswere also a big thing in 2021. Businesses can draw inspiration from brands like LizK, the conceiver of Premium R. This brand centers on a natural fermentation process similar to those used by the women in Huangluo Yao village, China. LizK blends cutting-edge technology with vinegar to produce a unique ingredient with hair-darkening properties.</p> \n<p>Scalp health is another actionable aspect of K-beauty haircare. Businesses can consider adding scalp health to their formulation process, allowing their products to provide a base forhair growthand health. Attract Lazy Skinimalist consumers with premium, salon-grade ingredients. Lash growth formulations can also present businesses with more profit opportunities.</p> \n<h3>Below-the-belt beauty: intimate skincare</h3> \n<p>The rising awareness around sexual wellness and health creates new business opportunities in K-beauty personal care. There\u2019s plenty of room for innovation since this category has limitedproduct offerings, and K-brands are up for the challenge. In addition, consumers are turning away from wash products and ingestible items that may disrupt vaginal flora.</p> \n<p>2022\u2019s K-beauty Expo saw many brands providing innovative solutions for variousintimate wellness needs. For example, Pantoc\u2019s probiotic feminine hygiene powders encompass ingredients to help improve vaginal health. The brand\u2019s FDA-approved powder directly supplies lactobacillus when consumers apply it on sanitary pads or underwear.</p> \n<p>Consumers need more than wipes andlow-pH intimate washes. Consider investing in formulations accounting for various hygiene and personal health concerns. Demands will continue gravitating toward clean and safe sexual care products. Convenience and portability are other factors businesses can expect to drive customer preference.</p> \n<h3>\u2018Notox\u2019 skincare: for tweakment-like results</h3> \n<p>Noninvasive aesthetic procedures are on the rise as consumers embrace the tweakment culture. Many customers perform procedures to improve specific body parts. However, they can be painful and expensive.\u2018Notox\u2019 skincarecopies these effects but eliminates the associated cost and pain.</p> \n<p>The K-beauty Expo 2022 witnessed brands leverage technology and medical research to create pain-free and quick-delivery cosmeceuticals. Products likemicro-needle patchesprovided an easy way to get transdermal ingredient delivery. Brands like Acropass utilize this technology to deliver sodium hyaluronate, cayenne pepper, and acetyl octapeptide-3 extracts. In addition, consumers can apply these patches on the lips to replicate a lip filler effect.</p> \n<p>Businesses can leverage this K-beauty trend by focusing on ingredients with instant delivery and high-performance results. These materials are ideal alternatives to invasive procedures, and consumers love them. For instance,epidermal growth factor(EGF) is a widespread skincare alternative to Botox, making it an ideal ingredient for investment.</p> \n<h3>K-ingredients: a new meaning to made in Korea</h3> \n<p>Limitations from the pandemic affected global supply chains and forced K-beauty brands to source ingredients closer to home. This move redefined the meaning of \u201cmade in Korea\u201d as emerging brands utilizeregion-inclusive materials. Brands sourcing local products reduce carbon emissions and enhance domestic economies.</p> \n<p>In addition, products made fromlocally-sourced ingredientshave fewer chemical treatments, and consumers deem them fresh. The K-beauty Expo\u2019s vegan brand The Pure Lotus boasted 100% local botanicals on all its products. The brand harvested its white lotus leaf extract from a Buddhist temple pond and its Jeju complex 9 from a blend of Jeju Island\u2019s natural ingredients.</p> \n<p>Follow this trend by swapping standard active ingredients for locally sourced alternatives. Brands can draw inspiration from traditional and regional processing techniques to help enhance material potency. Additionally, tapping into upcycled ingredient models will help businesses discover various skincare functions from domestic food items.</p> \n<h3>Skintelligent solutions: a new age of personalization</h3> \n<p>One unbelievable theme showcased at the K-beauty Expo 2022 is skin analysis technology. Many K-brands adopted this technology to predict future skin changes, detect recurring issues, and better understand their consumers\u2019 skin. Skintellingent solutions result from advances in biomarker sensing technologies and microbiome analysis, allowing for more sophisticated and personalizedproduct offerings.</p> \n<p>Incorporating skin analysis technology also enriches consumer experiences.

In addition, consumers can get their report with skincare tips and recommendations when they download the brand\u2019s app.</p> \n<p>Leverage innovations that takecosmeticsto the consumers. Businesses can invest in technology that offers products according to consumer lifestyle and location.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Catering to specific personal care and health concerns shows more potential than universal products in 2023. Locally sourced ingredients offer more advantages and make products unique enough to stand against global competitors.</p> \n<p>In addition, drift toward products offering fast, tweakment-like results to profit from rising demand. Brands can gain consumer trust by acquiring proof of efficacy, safety accreditations,\u00a0 and science-backed formulas.</p> \n<p>Cosmetic brands must get inspiration from these K-beauty skincare trends to make irresistible product offerings in 2023.</p> \n"}]}

Mindful gifting is preferred</h3> \n<p>People want to receive thoughtful, practical gifts for the upcoming Valentine\u2019s Day. Yes, classic cards and flowers will still be in demand, but there are more innovative products people can opt for.</p> \n<p>Consumers prefer practical gifts nowadays, especially with the occurring global inflation. As such, it comes as no surprise that one-time-use novelty products are slowly getting abandoned by consumers.</p> \n<p>Thoughtful gifts can also include other considerations.

Gifts likeslow-burning candlesand temperature-changingmassage oilsare popular among lovers.</p> \n<p>The demand for sensual gifts and items for beds is also increasing.

However, much of menstrual care is unexplored, giving businesses ample opportunities to satisfy consumers and make profits.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow large is the menstrual care industryMenstrual care: 5 trends to watch closely in 2023Final words</p> \n<h2>How large is the menstrual care industry globally?</h2> \n<p>Theworldwide feminine hygiene products markethad a $37.20 billion size in 2020. Unfortunately, the industry also suffered backlashes from the pandemic and lockdown era. Demand across all regions shrank by 2.65%, reducing the market\u2019s size.</p> \n<p>However, experts predict the market will expand from its $38.18 billion value in 2021 to $54.52 billion by 2028. They expect it to move at a CAGR of 5.22% over the forecast period. In addition, the industry owes its revival to the return of the pre-pandemic era.</p> \n<p>Technological advancements and increasing quality education enlighten women on how their bodies work, including menstruation cycles. Avoiding poor sanitation in genital areas is now a primary concern among consumers. The increased awareness and demand for menstrual care products help propel this market\u2019s growth.</p> \n<p>North America and Europe hold significant shares in the global feminine hygiene market. Moreover, Asia Pacific accounts for over 40% of the total 2020 revenue, generating up to $11.96 billion. Experts expect the region to dominate the industry over the forecast period.</p> \n<h2>Menstrual care: 5 trends to watch closely in 2023</h2> \n<h3>Menstruating to menopause: the perimenopause transition</h3> \n<p>There\u2019s a lot to educate about the female body, and one engaging topic is \u201cmenstruating to menopause.\u201d Interestingly, women will have three stages: premenopause, menopause, and postmenopause. The first stage eases ladies into the transition from menstruation to menopause.</p> \n<p>Premenopause usually starts between ages forty and forty-four and may last anywhere from seven to ten years. Women may experience irregular periods, night sweats, collagen loss, mood swings, and other effects due to low estrogen levels. In 2020, approximately44% of women globallyhad no idea premenopause existed.</p> \n<p>Businesses must consider pushing menopause literacy as much as they push menstrual care. They can address premenopause symptoms with products likecooling skincare. Brands like the State of Menopause leverages this trend to create cooling skits for women. Usually, they include moisturizers, face oils, and sprays.</p> \n<p>Brands can also take the skincare route, like Paula\u2019s Choice. They offerrenewal serumsmade from phytoestrogen to help women with estrogen-depleted skin.</p> \n<h3>Menstruation\u2019s new identity: period care for all</h3> \n<p>Menstruation is losing the taboo insignia, and this trend proves it. This new era for menstrual care responds to consumers\u2019 demand for open conversations and inclusiveperiod products. In addition, these changes pave the way for menstruation brands to make more attractive product offerings.</p> \n<p>However, it\u2019s not just about becoming accepted.Menstrual careis evolving to include non-female-identifying individuals. More brands are expanding their conversations to include nonconforming, trans, gender-fluid, and non-binary consumers. They also extend to people with disabilities.</p> \n<p>For this trend, brands must avoid makingproducts gender-specific. It would help ensure they meet everyone\u2019s needs. Some brands don\u2019t use the term \u201chygienic\u201d to describe products. Such shifts prevent the idea that periods are dirty. In addition, businesses must ensure they use terms such as \u201cmenstruators\u201d when referring to consumers who experience periods.</p> \n<h3>Period problems: addressing period pain</h3> \n<p>This trend busts the myth that periods equal living in discomfort and pain. Sometimes, other conditions could interfere with a menstruator\u2019s cycle, like premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), endometriosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). These conditions can cause discomfort and disruptions, including irregular periods, unbearable period pain, and intense mood swings.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization states that one in ten women suffer endometriosis globally. Mostperiod reliefbrands believe that stereotypes about period pains prevent menstruators from diagnosing and treating this condition. In truth, many businesses miss the opportunity to appeal to consumers suffering from period pains and make their lives easier.</p> \n<p>Capitalize on solutions for long-term cramps asalternatives to painkillers. Brands like Somedays offer antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory formulations that tackle the source of period pain. Businesses may also use online platforms to address the myths surrounding this issue.</p> \n<h3>Cycle syncing: 360-degree menstrual health</h3> \n<p>The future of personal care is evolving toward solutions focusing on the four stages of menstrual cycles. Most consumers believe the menstrual cycle only lasts during the bleeding phase, but it\u2019s way longer than that. With more knowledge about menstrual health making rounds, menstruators are demanding more skincare and wellness routines catering to the four-period stages: menstrual, follicular, ovulation, and luteal.</p> \n<p>2023 will see more consumers taking control of their menstrual health. There may be a shift from synthetic hormones tosupportive ingestible. Some supplements have designs that support hormonal balance, while others push hormone health. These products are a softer way to control menstrual health since they feature adaptogens, homeopathic herbs, and plant extracts.</p> \n<p>Dive into cycle care by offering information on the changes consumers may encounter at each phase. Also, businesses should recommendproductsto address each stage, whether they be for skincare or hormonal balance. Avoid offering supplements with potentially harmful chemicals that may mess with natural hormones.</p> \n<h3>Flowing slowly: menstruation made sustainable</h3> \n<p>Sustainable solutions are one way to attract eco-conscious consumers.Menstrual productscreate a lot of waste yearly, and menstruators demand alternatives to help reduce the numbers. Consumers can use anywhere between five thousand and fifteen thousand tampons and pads in their lifetime. Unfortunately, most end up as waste and contribute to the world\u2019s carbon levels.</p> \n<p>However, product innovations like organic pads & tampons,reusable menstrual cups, re-wearable period underwear, and pads make menstrual health more sustainable. Businesses must determine how they can eliminate plastic packaging on their product offerings. Prioritize biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable packaging.</p> \n<p>Businesses diving into reusable products must focus on hypoallergenic and antibacterial properties. These ensure the offerings are safe for consumers. In addition, other products to watch include100% organic tamponsand menstrual discs.</p> \n<h2>Final words</h2> \n<p>Menstrual health in 2023 is evolving toward more inclusive products. Gendering period care is old school and won\u2019t cater to the needs of all menstruating consumers. Additionally, encourage consumers to take authority over their menstrual cycles and provide solutions for every phase.</p> \n<p>Invest in sustainable materials to ensure your product offerings resonate with consumer demands. Reusable formats are hot trends menstruators love and will purchase in 2023.</p> \n<p>Businesses must draw influence from these menstrual care trends to provide appealing and supportive product offerings in 2023.</p> \n"}]}

Additionally, they should be open to the idea of collaborating with top influencers to reach all corners.</p> \n<p>Brands can deviate from the traditional Pan-Asian standard and employ all-encompassing imagery. They can aslo accomplish this by including trans and cis models in their marketing campaigns. Brands can go even further by inviting people from all walks of life to share their stories, resulting in effective collaboration.</p> \n<h3>Skin-friendly solutions</h3> \n<p>To meet the increasing demand for skin wellness, top brands are now offering cosmetics and beauty products that are biocompatible with all skin types. Its products containnourishingactive ingredients at skin-friendly pH levels to keep the skin healthy and strong. Almost all such products contain ceramide, cica,niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid, all known to fight bacteria and pollutants.</p> \n<p>Another trend in the beauty space is the inclusion of cooling agents in different products to cater to people who live in hot, tropical climates. For example, Happy Skins\u2019 Rescue Me Sun Mist containsSPFwith cooling properties and is designed for easy reapplication. They went one step further by developing an ergonomic design that makes the spray portable and easy to use, attracting many customers.</p> \n<p>In order to provide clean, safe, andhigh-qualityproducts, many leading brands outsource their manufacturing to Japan, and South Korea. This is because hygiene regulations and laws in these countries are more stringent than in the Philippines, which appeals to many consumers.</p> \n<p>Companies can capitalize on this renewed interest in wellness by offeringproductswith scientifically supported formulas and gentle ingredients that help the skin\u2019s natural pH. Additionally, the products must be dermatologically tested and certified to be free of harmful chemicals.</p> \n<h3>Embracing local culture and diversity</h3> \n<p>Filipinos are proud of their heritage, and brands that celebrate the diversity and culture of the Philippines are doing well in the market. These brands go above and beyond by developing formulations tailored to the skin tones of the locals, with inclusive packaging featuring dark-skinned individuals. Filipinta beauty, for instance, sells makeup pouches depicting two Filipinos with different skin tones side by side, hand painted by a local Filipino artist.</p> \n<p>Many products from these brands frequently draw inspiration from food and other elements found on the streets of the Philippines. For instance, the eyeshadow palette from Filipinta Beauty is influenced by popular Filipino childhood treats like Ube cakes and banana ketchup.\u00a0 Furthermore, theirlipglossesare packaged similarly to how items were traditionally sold in Filipino neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>By employing models with darker skin tones and releasing comic strips that refute harmful beauty narratives, many brands are setting the bar for diversity. Their messaging frequently examines the negative aspects of colorism and the exaltation of skin-whitening products through powerful narratives.</p> \n<p>Many local beauty brands are collaborating with Filipino-owned businesses in the US to increase their customer base. For instance, a well-known cosmetics company teamed up with the chocolate company Oodaalolly to produce lipstick with designs resembling the latters\u2019 chocolate wrappers.</p> \n<h3>Planet-friendly solutions</h3> \n<p>As customers become aware of the environmental challenges, more and more are looking for sustainable brands that offer creative solutions to reduce waste and encourage recycling. They are seekingvegan, cruelty-free, and affordable products with zero-waste packaging. A brand that stands out in this regard is Akkula because it takes its zero-waste approach seriously, allowing users to join the sustainable movement.</p> \n<p>Sustainable brands are leaving a mark by providing multifunctional skin care lines made entirely ofnaturalingredients, with products infused with raspberry oil to soothe and nourish the skin. Vegan lip balms that use candelilla wax derived from plants rather than beeswax also benefit the cause.</p> \n<p>To reduce waste in landfills, top brands now offer products packaged in recycled paper that are entirelybiodegradable. They also source theiringredientsfrom regenerative farms and infuse their packaging with seeds that can be later planted in soil. Similarly, Akkula gets its coconut oil from local farms known for empowering local farmers through fair and ethical trade practices.</p> \n<h3>Celebrate intimacy and pleasure</h3> \n<p>Conversations about sex are still frowned upon in many conservative Asian countries, and many brands aim to change that. Brands like Jelly Time are on a mission to educate the community about several sensitive issues.</p> \n<p>Many companies are offering water-based, hypoallergenic products after identifying a gap in the Philippine market for clean and naturallubricants. The leading brands provide products that are edible and non-toxic, have a pH of 7.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, companies are improvinglubricantsby incorporating natural ingredients such as aloe vera to add moisture. They also offer a selection of products in discreet designs and packaging to the self-conscious shopper who lives with others.</p> \n<h2>Action points</h2> \n<p>Customers appreciate brands that allow them to participate in product design conversations and have first access to new releases and sales. Many people enjoy being part of a community, such as\u00a0 Facebook groups, where they can have exclusive benefits.</p> \n<p>Affordability is a top priority for many consumers in the Philippines. Brands that cut unnecessary costs by selling miniatures of large sizes products and offering discounts will appeal to many shoppers.</p> \n<p>Recycling systems in the Philippines are underdeveloped, and brands must take this into consideration. Repurposed materials and zero waste solutions are the best options for consumers looking for sustainability.</p> \n<p>Patriotism is high, and brands that pay homage to Filipino culture are popular among locals and expats. Brands should incorporate reflective elements such as local art and food resembling the Philippines\u2019 streets in the packaging.</p> \n"}]}

Read about how brands are responding to and adapting to the economic turmoil and seeing success in the market.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the beauty industryShort-term beauty strategies that workTo sum up</p> \n<h2>An overview of the beauty industry</h2> \n<p>The current economic crisis has caused several issues, including supply shortages and rising inflation rates. As a result, consumers are more conscious about their spending and are rethinking theirbeautypriorities.</p> \n<p>Even though global inflation has reached5.5%in Asia, 9.1% in the US, and 8.6% in Europe, the lipstick effect continues to hold true for cosmetics.Beautyconglomerates such as Ulta Beauty and Estee Lauder have reported a9%sales growth in 2022. However, analysts predict that the industry will face disruptions and volatility in the near future.</p> \n<p>This article examines the immediate effects of the global economic downturn on beauty brands and discusses different business growth strategies.</p> \n<h2>Short-term beauty strategies that work</h2> \n<h3>Learning from past experiences</h3> \n<p>Brands must keep in mind the recent economic turbulence and develop strategies accordingly. Most businesses have learned that, while they can withstand temporary uncertainty, they must be prepared to pivot and plan for the future.</p> \n<p>For instance, many brands experiencedsupply chainissues due to the pandemic, which increased production and packaging lead times. Some companies responded by delaying the release of their products, while others raised prices on limited stock.</p> \n<p>Brands must make strategic stock management decisions regularly, which includes conducting a risk analysis of theproductsand inventory. They should also assess consumer behavior and distinguish between must-haves and nice-to-have products.</p> \n<p>Some brands have changed their strategies, ordering products far in advance to compensate for the increased production lead time. Others responded to shortages by focusing on marketingproductsthat are easy to manufacture.</p> \n<p>Even though analysts are concerned about the impending recession, the lipstick index shows that many consumers will continue to purchase beautyproducts. Companies must avoid making rash decisions and instead learn what their customers want. Some brands have responded to consumer feedback by introducing larger-sized products for the entire family.</p> \n<p>Adopting a flexible supply chain is critical to avoiding ingredient shortages. Brands must identify ingredients in theirformulationsthat can be at risk and identify alternate sources or find replacements for such raw materials.</p> \n<h3>Offering reasonable prices</h3> \n<p>Prices for most beauty products are likely to rise due to economic uncertainty, supply chain issues, rising employee wages, raw material costs, shipping, and fuel costs. Nordstrom, Sephora, and Ulta Beauty have raised their skincare prices by11%since 2020.</p> \n<p>Brandscan establish customer loyalty and trust by having open communications and being transparent about prices. They can accomplish this by communicating the decision-making process behind the price increase and giving them advance notice so they can stock up before the hike.</p> \n<p>Customers will respond positively and be more understanding ifbrandsexplain why they are raising prices. Some brands have done this through social media platforms, with the founder responding directly to customer comments. Other brands are experimenting with shrink-flation, which involves reducing the size of cosmetics while keeping the price constant.</p> \n<p>While some businesses have raised their prices, others have reduced their costs to gain a competitive edge in the market. For instance, by increasing distribution to major retailers, a US-based company could lower prices by 30\u201350% while producing higher volumes at a lower cost. However, this strategy should be used with caution because there is an increased risk of devaluing aproduct, and the reduced margin may not be sustainable in the long term.</p> \n<p>Customers seekhigh-qualityproducts and know that certain ingredients cost more than others. Therefore, it\u2019s a good idea to explain the rationale behind the price. For instance, Isla Beauty lists each product\u2019s price and the percentage of each active ingredient on its website.</p> \n<h3>Providing top-notch products</h3> \n<p>Shoppers will be pickier about their skincare products, but they will still be willing to pay more forhigh-qualityitems. Thus, emphasizing efficacy and quality will be critical in swaying indecisive and value-conscious customers.</p> \n<p>Moreover,73%of consumers believe that expensive products are ofhigher quality, justifying the price is essential. This thought is also echoed by Shiseido\u2019s CEO, who stated that in the wake of economic turbulence, consumers assess the functionality and efficacy of upscale skincare.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, in order to establish credibility, brands must back up their claims with clinical and consumer trials. Customers will also appreciate proof thatproductsare vegan and cruelty-free.</p> \n<p>Brands can use third-party testing to validate these claims and publish their data for customers to read and be informed.</p> \n<p>Dataalso indicates that many product-conscious customers are willing to pay a premium for skincare products. A popular K-beauty brand demonstrates this by producing high-quality, eco-friendlysoap barsbased on orders, thereby reducing pressure on its supply chain.</p> \n<p>To attract consumers\u2019 attention, brands must use social media platforms such as TikTok to highlight the appealing features of their products. They can also use dermatologists to explain the unique blends of theirskincareformulations, as well as show tutorials and before-and-after results.</p> \n<p>And lastly, many consumers, especially Generation Z, will seek socially responsible and authentic brands. They will be drawn to businesses that take meaningful steps to support social causes.</p> \n<h3>Fostering a community spirit</h3> \n<p>As the current period can be stressful for many consumers, brands must take meaningful steps to show compassion by offeringperksand discounts to earn loyalty and trust. This is important because57%of women worldwide are concerned about their finances, and58%of UK respondents believe that brands should help people by providing empathetic content. Some businesses are showing their support by using their platforms to share money-saving tips.</p> \n<p>Brands will shift their focus more on customer experience, increasing their D2C communications to make shopping more enjoyable. Some companies allow users to create personalizedskin careroutines using online shopping tools. Others provide free skincare consultations to help customers find the bestproductsfor their needs.</p> \n<p>The introduction of reward and loyalty programs will appeal to budget-conscious shoppers. Giving such offers to regular customers will promote customer loyalty and retention. Money-saving strategies like subscription services, discounts, and free samples can add value and influence a buying decision.</p> \n<h2>To sum up</h2> \n<p>\u2013 Given the economic uncertainty and supply chain issues, brands must adopt a flexible approach and prepare for future scenarios.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Customers value transparency, so brands must communicate their pricing decisions to their target audience openly and explain their decision-making process.</p> \n<p>\u2013 As many individuals are experiencing hardships, brands must be empathetic in their marketing approach and offer discounts, perks, deals, and reward schemes to assist those in need.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Customers will be discerning with their purchases, so brands must highlight their distinguishing features, provide evidence for their claims, and participate in charitable endeavors.</p> \n"}]}

Professional finish and application are top priorities in home nail applications, and consumers will prioritize products that deliver on both.</p> \n<p>When it comes to a professional finish, salon-qualitybase and top coatsare a must. Also, nail tools, such asUV dryers, that make application easier and more efficient are top of mind for consumers.</p> \n<p>In addition, as people upgrade their skills and confidence, they will seek out more complex products and nail tools. This will include more complex base and top products and tools into nail varnish kits, such asprimers and dehydrators.</p> \n<h3>The anti manicure</h3> \n<p>2024 will see the anti-manicure go mainstream. This stripped-back manicure will focus on nail health with products and treatments that nourish and tackle nail issues, and also promote healthy, natural nails. An overnighthand maskis a great way to nourish the skin and nails. Consumers also seeknail-specific masksto rejuvenate their nails separately from their hand care routine.</p> \n<p>The forced nail detox many people endured during the pandemic exposed the damaging effects of nail applications and increased awareness of long-term issues. Gel, powder, and acrylic manicures can damage the nail plate. At the same time, some chemicals in polishes have been linked to health issues. As a result, beauty consumers will choose products that support healthy nails. Many consumers add anail serumto their regular hand care routine to promote nail growth.</p> \n<p>It is also important not to forget toenails and extend the anti-manicure to tackle taboo toe conditions such asingrown toenailsandnail fungus. And, of course, treating dry, cracked skin on the feet with afoot peel.</p> \n<h3>Facials for the hands</h3> \n<p>People are taking skincare beyond the face and are prioritizing taking care of the entire body. Body facials, in particular, aim to protect and rebalance the skin\u2019s natural functions and improve the skin\u2019s natural barrier.</p> \n<p>Increased hand washing will continue, exacerbating dryness and other hand issues. So, body facials also benefit the hands. Hand care will borrow from every aspect of the skincare category, and consumers will dedicate the same attention to the skin on their hands as on their faces. This includeshand creams and treatments with retinolto manage wrinkles and dryness, and to prevent the signs of aging.</p> \n<p>Like skincare, hand care will shift focus to prevention,with SPFproducts that prevent skin damage before they are visible.</p> \n<p>Science-backed technological innovations such asred-light,LED, andvibrationhand and nail devices are also being used to promote hand and nail health.</p> \n<h3>Self-expression through nails</h3> \n<p>With faces covered during the pandemic, nails have become a way for people to express themselves. Whether playful and fun, or subversive and dark, nails will allow people to express themselves and experiment via color, stickers, and nail art.</p> \n<p>A wide variety of options when it comes tonail colorsand art is a must; consider some of these options:</p> \n<p>\u2013Bright colors</p> \n<p>\u2013 Glow in the darkpolishandart</p> \n<p>\u2013Glitter</p> \n<p>\u2013Chrome pigment</p> \n<p>\u2013 Nail art, such ascharms,rhinestones,stickers, etc.</p> \n<p>A less binary approach to beauty has also seen men embracing nail polish for everyday use. Dubbed the \u201cmen-icure\u201d, colored nails are a form of gender identity activism and, by 2024, will be embedded as a new normal.</p> \n<p>There is certainly an opportunity for retailers to capitalize on creative nail art,gender-neutral nail polishes,male manicure sets, and accessible product designs for a wider customer base.</p> \n<p>Smart manicures are also on the horizon. NFC-chipped nails that allow consumers to pay for goods or store data will go from novelty to normal, so consider investing in development now.</p> \n<h3>Hand sanitizer 2.0</h3> \n<p>Hand hygiene, including hand sanitizers, has become an integral part of our routine for safe interactions.

To assist customers with starting and ending their day in an intentional way, facial tools can also be included as part of the skincare routine.</p> \n<h3>Strengthening skincare</h3> \n<p>An increased awareness of skin health will see customers becoming more educated on the impacts of external aggressors and overuse of active ingredients on skin barriers.</p> \n<p>Microbiome-friendly skincare will be key to strengthening and restoring the skin\u2019s natural flora, especially for those withsensitive skin.Barrier repair skincarewith microbiome-friendly certifications orceramides, peptides and pre, pro and postbiotics can appeal to customers looking to repair damaged skin.Collagenis also another key ingredient for elasticity and hydration.</p> \n<h3>Tweakment treatments</h3> \n<p>Tweakmentis a term that refers to non-surgical, minimally invasive treatments that aim to make small changes to one\u2019s appearance without surgery.

As a result, consumers began to associate smell with health as they saw the effects of smell loss on overall well-being.</p> \n<p>New products are being formulated to help consumers learn more about scent and its importance as a bodily function. Brands can capitalize on this new interest by selling perfumes with natural scents. Thiscoconut fragrance, for example, will invoke an appreciation for nature.</p> \n<p>Demand for products like smell training kits, created to help perfumers detect subtle scents in perfumes, has also risen. These kits are used to help those suffering from a loss of smell by providing daily smell training.</p> \n<p>Brands that can adapt to the new interests and applications of scent while still providing these healthful products will be successful. Be sure to tailor the product to the audience. Established fragrance consumers will still look forquality fragranceswhile newer customers will want samples to find their scent.</p> \n<h3>A desire for storytelling</h3> \n<p>Certain groups are moving away from mass-produced fragrances and are choosing to support small, POC-owned businesses that have a focus on culture. The items that do well in these instances often pay attention to community preferences, such as the preference for portable fragrances within the Chinese market.</p> \n<p>Consumers will want to use scent to tell their personal stories, as well as support their identities. This should be reflected not only in the scent but also in the packaging. As a result,interesting bottle shapeswill be popular with consumers.</p> \n<p>Consumers are also interested in using perfumes and scents to tell their own stories, and they\u2019ll be interested in layering and mixing scents on their own. These consumers will be interested in any kits that allow them to make or customize their own scents.</p> \n<h3>Combining scent and wellness</h3> \n<p>Air quality and air purification were big concerns during the health crisis. Even now that health restrictions are easing, consumers are still very concerned about indoor air quality. Indoor air quality can be affected by many things ranging from environmental pollutants tracked in by shoes to excessive moisture in the house.</p> \n<p>Working from home has increased the desire for good indoor air quality, and brands are combining scent and air purification into one product. Products likefragrance diffusersthat provide fine fragrance and overall wellness throughout the day are also seeing a steep increase in demand. Scents are tailored to specific mood enhancements, including energy, relaxation, and sleep.</p> \n<h3>Using fragrance in digital spaces</h3> \n<p>Social media has become one of the biggest drivers of fine fragrance sales, as consumers are using platforms like Instagram and TikTok to share recommendations and find new products. Brands have responded by taking more of an interest in digital and metaverse spaces. Fine fragrance products include access to digital spaces and experiences through NFC chips and QR codes.</p> \n<p>Some products include tech in the products themselves that users can interact with using their phones. Inevitably, the internet is affecting perfume and home fragrance \u2014 brands are now creating products and experiences based on what consumers imagine digital spaces would \u201csmell\u201d like.</p> \n<h3>Looking for sustainable options</h3> \n<p>As with mostbeautyproducts in the current atmosphere, sustainability will be a sought-after selling point. Consumers don\u2019t want to go without, but they do want to shop and consume more responsibly. Any products that help them do that will be highly desired.</p> \n<p>Fragrance products are looking into using white biotech as a sustainability method. \u201cWhite biotech\u201d is asynthetic processthat aims to use microorganisms to create ingredients with an incredibly low carbon footprint \u2014 this will become a common practice in the clean fragrance industry. This process has helped brands create ingredients that can\u2019t be acquired due to supply chain issues.</p> \n<p>In addition to ingredients, scent brands will of course look into improvingsustainable packaging. Brands that want to remain relevant will need to create campaigns that are transparent and honest with consumers about their environmental response.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Now that health concerns and physical restrictions are easing, brands can expect to see demand for fine fragrances returning. Thefragrance marketwill see new consumers who are health-conscious and interested in using scent for wellness.</p> \n<p>The global fragrance market will see many changes, from digital influence to a new focus on sustainability. Successful brands must be ready and willing to adapt to the new landscape.</p> \n"}]}

For example, in 2022 the UK retailer Boots launched acampaign to address hygiene povertyin their community.</p> \n<p>This issue plagued the community and only got worse as fewer people were able to afford the products they needed. Customers who bought products had the option to donate to the campaign when they paid for their items. Even if they don\u2019t benefit from the donated services, consumers will still feel that the concerns have been acknowledged and that action is being taken to help consumers.</p> \n<h3>Making luxury budget-friendly</h3> \n<p>As in-person retailers are becoming one-stop shops for everyone, many retailers are taking steps to expand theirbeauty brands. Many small to medium cosmetic companies are struggling to stay in business during this economic crisis, so some have partnered with retailers like Target to offer their products at affordable prices.</p> \n<p>This product assortment allows retailers to offer quality products to consumers at all price points. Products like thisanti-wrinkle cream setare priced low enough that most consumers will be able to afford to experience these luxurious items. Companies that show a willingness to make luxury and quality attainable at any price point will gain consumer loyalty during this tough time.</p> \n<h3>Offering prestige products</h3> \n<p>Somebeauty brandshave addressed the recession by creating more affordable products by using diffusion lines. A diffusion line is a beauty brand considered a \u201csecond-tier\u201d collection owned by a larger, more prestigious company.</p> \n<p>These cosmetic brands are offshoots of more expensive, established brands that aim to create more affordable products and capture a wider audience.</p> \n<p>These brands have partnered with retailers like Walmart to spread their brands into as many areas as possible. This practice makes products like luxuriousmatte finish pressed powdersmore accessible to many consumers.</p> \n<p>Diffusion lines have also contributed to dupe culture, which is the practice of finding more affordable products that do the same thing as more expensive products.</p> \n<p>Budget-friendly products like thislong-lasting perfumeare sought after because they\u2019re similar to high-end or expensive perfumes. Customers will appreciate finding affordable alternatives to luxurious products that are still good quality.</p> \n<h3>Prioritizing honesty</h3> \n<p>Everyone, from consumers to manufacturers, is struggling to afford what they need right now. Consumers value transparency and honesty from brands now that social media has made customer-to-company communication so easy.</p> \n<p>Realistically, it might not be possible for brands to remain budget-friendly in the current economic situation, but being honest with consumers about the rise in prices is a great way to maintain customer loyalty.</p> \n<p>Companies are using social media channels to speak with consumers and discuss branding, pricing, supply chain issues, and other factors that may keep costs higher.</p> \n<p>Communicating with customers, whether to tell them about a price increase or a shipping delay, will go a long way to maintaining customer loyalty. Customers don\u2019t want to feel ignored, so even if the news isn\u2019t good news, customers will appreciate an honest update from the company.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Rising inflation has caused brands to reconfigure the way they do business. Customers are looking for ways to spend less while maintaining their lifestyles.</p> \n<p>Following practices like offering budget-friendly products or prioritizing community outreach will help businesses thrive during this time.</p> \n"}]}

Especially in the last decade, beauty products are noticeably more inclusive ofgenderand differences inskin colorand tone, which reaches a wider range of potential consumers. So, collections should always incorporate this to successfully grasp a bigger market. Here is a breakdown of some must-have trends starting from the face next down to the eyebrows, leading to everything in between.</p> \n<h3>Face</h3> \n<p>When it comes to the face, the prep is what will get that $5,000 feeling!Jade rollersare a good start. Traditionally, they were used inChinese medicineto remove bad chi amongst other things. However, it\u2019s now known that they can increase circulation to the face, help to relieve tiredunder-eyesandincrease plumpness, adding a youthful glow.</p> \n<p>The next step before makeup is to use face serum containing some on-trend ingredients, like;hyaluronic acid, vitamin E,vitamin C(all of which moisturize and heal), andcollagen(maintains the skin\u2019s youthful glow).</p> \n<p>Finally, there comes makeup. When it comes to the\u201cdewy look\u201d, the best way to achieve this look is through the minimal application offoundationandconcealer\u2014the lighter finish allows the natural aspects of the skin to shine through. Equally, avoid matt finish products to maintain the fresh sheen, except for theunder-eye area, which benefits from a slightly matt finish. The next step is Eyebrows!</p> \n<h3>Eyebrows</h3> \n<p>Believe it or not, it has been around10 yearssinceeyebrows have gotten bushier, not so plucked, and somewhat less groomed. Thetrend of thickeryet sophisticated provides the eyes with the perfect surround and helps to define facial features. The look has madebrow cosmeticsa must-have in the makeup bag.</p> \n<p>Creating the ungroomed brow trend starts withserum(not like face serum) that can be left on overnight. It will help increaseeyebrow growth, making brows feelconditioned and fuller. The next step is to apply either awaxor atinted brow balmthat will shape the brow, fill in any patchy areas, and give the brow an even finish.</p> \n<h3>Eyes</h3> \n<p>Moving down to the eyes, they can be decorated in many ways, but in order to keep them looking bright, there are a good few products to consider. Eye prep will make makeup pop and help remove unwanted dark circles. This is where the jade roller makes another appearance, then followed by some under-eye cream, which will keep eyes and the skin around themmoisturizedand prevent eyeshadow/eyeliner from looking flaky under dry skin.</p> \n<p>Once eyes are bright, trends are pretty fluid but stand-out ones include eyeliner in classicblackand some brighter anddaring colors, which are often drawn on in a thin line above the eyelash area. Secondly,luster eyeshadowis mostly applied as a full color across the eye, either indust formthat is put on with a finger (much like makeup artist Pat Mcgrath) or inliquid form, which often dries matt when applied with a brush.</p> \n<p>Mascara is the final touch to making eyes look awake and fresh.Black is chicandlengtheningto the lashes, butbrownis a sophisticated alternative and can work well with the natural and unfussy look. Although the natural trend is prominent, it can be highlighted withbright-colored mascara\u2014in an 80s revival kind of way\u2014with petrol blueand the addition of fluorescent pink, lime green, and purple.</p> \n<h3>Cheeks</h3> \n<p>Let\u2019s move down to\u2026cheeks. Cheeks and cheekbones can be a great place to implement the trend of the multipurpose product.Stick/cream blusherscan be a quick way to addcolortocheeks and lips. As the world moves faster, so does the application of makeup, so having a product that can be applied in two places is a must. Equally,cheekbone highlighterscan be used aseyeshadows, making another addition to the two-in-one cosmetic.</p> \n<h3>Lips</h3> \n<p>Finally, there come the lips. Above you saw how cheek blush can be added to lips and, although the dual-purpose cosmetic is positive for the consumer, it\u2019s not their only option. Lip prep, like other parts of the face, is just as important in creating a luxury look.Lip scrubs/exfoliators, especially organic, are a great way ofremoving dry skinand will makelipstick,glossortinted balmlook smooth and fabulous.</p> \n<p>Fuller lips are also on trend, but for those that are moving away from filler and opting for natural alternatives, products to consider includelip-plumpersthat will allow the lip to feelfullerby naturally addingvolume.</p> \n<p>When it comes to lip color, the trend is eithernatural, or if daring enough,deep plumshades have started to show up on the catwalks and give a sultry yet elegant look. Styles of lipstick/tint vary from velvet finish, matt and gloss, all of which can be worn depending on the overall look desired.</p> \n<h2>How combining trends will give a complete look</h2> \n<p>Any small business/wholesaler looking to stock luxurious beauty trends should aim to combine different ranges into one collection. Ideally, you want to cover the whole face and include face preparation products alongside makeup.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re stocking your business for natural and unfussy trends, be sure to include multi-purpose products. These will tempt the low-maintenance consumer who is looking for cosmetics and beauty care products that can be combined and have two purposes, making them easy to carry and apply.</p> \n<p>Bright and daring color ranges can add a wow factor but still be applied simply to a traditional makeup base. So, make sure you stock the right kind of complementary products, like some good liquid foundations and concealers, together with the prep products already mentioned, which can be combined with some bright mascara, eyeliner and luster eyeshadows.</p> \n<p>When people like to look good, prep is important. Prep followed by the right kind of on-trend and luxury makeup choices will give the $5,000 face that consumers may desire. Ensuring all the beauty cosmetics and treatments are inclusive will also broaden your reach, and these products can be marketed to suit a wide range of ages and types of people, and in turn, be profitable for your small business.</p> \n"}]}

However, marketing experts estimate the industry will expand to US $415.29 billion by 2028 with a 5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the 2021\u20132028 forecast period.</p> \n<p>Surging demand for make-up and skincare products is positively driving this market\u2019s growth, and teens and tweens are active participants. Both boys and girls use skincare products to create positive self-images without looking too grown-up.</p> \n<p>In-between beauty products also accommodate other categories that help youngsters adjust to their changing bodies. Although the initial reception for teens\u2019 and tweens\u2019 beauty products was unfavorable, businesses can expect more trends supporting experimentation and self-expression to be popular in 2023.</p> \n<h2>5 in-betweener beauty trends that will rock 2023</h2> \n<h3>Beginner grooming</h3> \n<p>Redefine male teens\u2019 and tweens\u2019 hygiene care by opting for earlygrooming products. Usually, male consumers tend to hit puberty later than their female counterparts. The need for hygiene starts between the ages of nine and fourteen. These consumers will naturally gravitate towards products focusing on body odor, hair (particularly oily hair), and skin.</p> \n<p>Althoughearly groomingand hygiene kits for boys are less common, catering to their needs is just as essential as their female counterparts. Most brands in the grooming sector focus on the male demographic as a whole instead of age-specific products.</p> \n<p>While beginner grooming is a minor beauty category, it offers many opportunities for businesses to expand product catalogs by focusing on young boys. They can provide shavestarter kitsfor in-betweeners that cater to the changing and softer skin.</p> \n<p>Likewise, retailers can provide themedbar soapsreferencing popular movies and video games. This combo would have strong appeal for young boys.</p> \n<p>Although it\u2019s not in-betweener specific, businesses can offer non-toxic, 100% natural, and chemical-free skin- andbody-care productsfor tweens, teens, and young adults.</p> \n<h3>First period care</h3> \n<p>Nothing is embarrassing about first periods, though most young consumers think otherwise. Whenperiod underwearbrand Thinx and nonprofit PERIOD conducted research, it showed that 76% of U.S. students menstruating between the ages of 13 and 19 indicated that periods have negative perceptions. 65% also agreed that society teaches young females to be embarrassed by their periods.</p> \n<p>However, such notions are what the first-period care trend seeks to correct. Female puberty can kick in between the ages of eight and fourteen, makingperiod carean essential category. More brands are engaging in conversations around period care to help transform the narrative from taboo to transparent.</p> \n<p>One great example of this is Disney\u2019s \u2018Turning Red\u2019. The animation follows the story of a 13-year-old girl going through puberty. She turns into a big red panda whenever her emotions overwhelm her, mirroring first-period experiences in a way tweens can understand.</p> \n<p>Although some adults may feel uncomfortable talking about periods, many brands, especially in western markets, are normalizing menstruation conversations throughstarter kits. Businesses can provide kits with educational guides, conversation cards, and cycle tracking stickers to ease youngsters into the period process while making them feel comfortable.</p> \n<h3>Filter face</h3> \n<p>Social media is a big part of this generation of teens and tweens. It keeps motivating young audiences to grow up faster than their predecessors. Though this sounds like a good thing, there are some negative aspects. Andbeautybrands are seeking to address them with the filter face trend.</p> \n<p>Most girls and adolescents are more prone to terrible well-being when exposed to heavy social media usage. They may experience more depressive symptoms, making them feel worthless and unhappy about their physical appearance.</p> \n<p>Brands should note that physical appearance is more of an everyday obsession due to the pressure to follow viral trends on apps like TikTok. In truth, frequent beauty filter trends that slim jaw lines, blur blemishes, or make eyes look brighter can negatively impact a user\u2019s self-perception.</p> \n<p>But, it\u2019s possible to turn these filters into educational tutorials and tools. Dove is an example of a brand in this niche. Dove\u2019s \u201cReverse Selfie\u201d campaign features a teenager modifying her appearance on an editing app, showing the depth of social media pressure.</p> \n<p>More importantly, the brand aims to help 250 million tweens and teens achieve a positive body image by 2030.</p> \n<h3>Skincare training</h3> \n<p>The \u201cawkward\u201d teen and tween years are like transformation periods. Younger consumers may notice changes to their skin as early as ten years old, makingskincareroutines essential.</p> \n<p>Retailers must keep up with the growing trend as more in-betweeners look to social media for skincare advice and parents focus onsafe products. Since these youngsters have unlimited access to celebrity and influencer skincare routines, it\u2019s crucial to use products that support the changing skin, not work against it.</p> \n<p>In-betweener skincare training should prioritize sensitive-skin formulations like SPF-infused blends, gentle cleansers, as well as lightweight and oil-free moisturizers.</p> \n<p>Teens and tweens don\u2019t need complex routines. Businesses should consider focusing onsimple productsto address common problems like acne and create satisfying rituals.</p> \n<p>Some brands acknowledge the evolving needs of these consumers by providinggentle skincare products. They also support and help build effective healthy routines.</p> \n<p>Consumers can also opt for age-specific skincare products for the 0\u20133, 3\u20136, and 7\u201312 age ranges. Retailers can also appeal to this cohort by offering products with playful packaging that helps build enjoyable and stress-free beauty routines.</p> \n<h3>Child\u2019s play to face play</h3> \n<p>Social media continues to rest at the center of in-betweener beauty trends. It drives the need to look more confident, pushing more tweens and teens towards color cosmetics. However,more than halfof teens in the U.S. use make-up for self-expression.</p> \n<p>According to Mintel,69% of boys and 90% of girlsbetween the ages of nine and seventeen indulge inbeauty products. The face play trend combines youthful curiosity with product exploration to give in-betweeners a creative outlet\u2013on the same level as painting and art.</p> \n<p>Face play also allows brands to join youngsters in their journey of self-discovery. Some businesses offer non-toxic andcolorful productsthat give in-betweeners the leeway to experiment with different looks. Many brands also promote self-love by adding inspirational words to their packaging.</p> \n<p>Teens and tweens want to join several beauty trends, and they demandproductsthat mimic real make-up. They can opt for nut, paraben, and cruelty-free color cosmetics to replicate the make-up experience. In-betweeners can also use clean and sensitive formulas for carefree applications without breakout risks.</p> \n<p>Young consumers can make things extra by opting for other beauty alternatives. They can also enjoy various foaminghair dyesor go wild with temporary tattoos.</p> \n<h2>Capitalize on these trends</h2> \n<p>2023 will encourage beauty experimentation and build safe environments for in-betweeners to discover themselves without judgment. Young consumers are demandingsensitive skincare products, hair care, and make-up as they evolve from their baby-soft skin.</p> \n<p>Parents will also prioritize products that help introduce their youngsters topersonal care. Products that usher in body and skin changes regardless of gender and race will help businesses tap into the teens and tweens beauty market.</p> \n<p>Hence, beginner grooming, first-period care, filter face, skincare training, and face play trends are effective ways for businesses to attract younger consumers.</p> \n"}]}

Post-tweakment aftercare and recovery</h3> \n<p>Brides-to-be in South Korea have been turning to procedures that are quick and non-invasive to enhance their skin and natural features for an effortless look.</p> \n<p>Tweakment-inspired products and pre- and post-procedureproducts that support and soothe the skinfor quick recovery have been seeing increasing interest as pre-wedding cosmetic procedures surge. Remote working and mask-wearing have driven the spike in cosmetic procedures as people can now discreetly recover from surgery beneath a mask or while working from home.</p> \n<p>Lifting procedures, such as InMode, Ulthera, and TuneFace, are popular among brides-to-be as they help to remove submental fat, define the jawline, tighten pores and loose skin, and promote collagen and elastin.

Honeymoon and beyond</h3> \n<p>The habits and routines that brides-to-be pick up during bridal bootcamp likely continue into the post-wedding period. This means that consumers will seek out the beauty products and treatments they used for their honeymoon and beyond to maintain their bridal glow.</p> \n<p>Newlyweds typically set off on their honeymoons right after their wedding ceremonies, hence products that are multifunctional ortravel-readywill be the most ideal for packing in carry-ons.

Wedding and honeymoon costs are soaring, hence consumers\u02bc budgets will shrink and more affordable alternatives to professional-grade procedures and treatments will be of interest. Understanding consumers\u02bc beauty priorities and their spending habits will be key to helping them make confident purchases.</p> \n<p>Retailers should also look at putting well-being at the forefront. Because weddings are stressful, retailers can focus on kits and products that improve well-being and calm brides-to-be during bootcamp. Selling products that aid sleep, lift emotions, boost energy, and relieve stress will help businesses establish a long-term brand connection with consumers.</p> \n<p>Lastly, retailers should think beyond the wedding (and also the bride). They should offer products for the post-wedding period that easily fit into brides\u2019 everyday lives. Retailers should also consider extending kits to include products for bridesmaids and the mother of the bride. In doing so, they will be able to leverage the season to establish new, long-term connections that turn curious individuals into loyal customers.Discover top-trending facial skincare tools consumers are looking forhere.</p> \n"}]}

In the shadow of the cost-of-living crisis, consumers\u2019 priorities are changing, with a strong emphasis on efficient, long-lasting products.</p> \n<p>There is also a shift in the consciousness of consumers, with more people gravitating towards sustainable alternatives. This article provides insights into what sustainability means for businesses.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe global sustainability movement5 top trends promoting environmental conservationActions for a sustainable future</p> \n<h2>The global sustainability movement</h2> \n<p>More businesses have recognized the significance of a sustainable business model in recent years. This is due to increased government regulations and public pressure on companies to be more environmentally friendly.</p> \n<p>Traditionally, projects were straightforward because the only goal was to transition to a more sustainable operation. However, businesses have also realized the importance of social movements and have started to respond by developing initiatives centered on them.</p> \n<p>More businesses starting from 2022,\u00a0 are expected to launch sustainability initiatives interlinked to social movements. These movements include forest conservation, water management, beekeeping, and other strategies promoting biodiversity.</p> \n<h3>The changing business landscape</h3> \n<p>As businesses move toward more sustainable practices, efforts are made to follow ethical principles from raw material sourcing to manufacturing, delivery, and everything in between. Companies are demanding higher standards from their suppliers by emphasizing environmental and human rights concerns.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the fashion industry is also making strides to reduce carbon emissions by recycling materials and encouraging consumers to trade in old clothes. This strategy is critical because nearly63%of consumers say they would prefer purchasing from brands that promote sustainability.</p> \n<p>Finally, there will be a strong emphasis on renewable energy and reducing pollution caused by fossil fuels. Consumers will increasingly seek out energy-efficient solutions in the future.</p> \n<h2>5 top trends promoting environmental conservation</h2> \n<h3>Waterless products that address scarcity concerns</h3> \n<p>By 2025, 1.8 billion people will live in water-stressed areas, so water-efficient products will gain momentum. This popularity is demonstrated by a sixfold increase in social media mentions ofwaterlessproducts in 2021. Many eco-friendly brands have now switched from high water-based formulas to water-restricted solutions. For example, freeze-dried skincare cubes are used on the face in conjunction with a toner or serum, eliminating water use.</p> \n<p>Thewater-less formulais adopted by other industries, such as the apparel industry. New technology has been developed that can dye almost any fabric without heat while using 90% less water and 40% less dye, attracting global attention. This transition can also be seen in the beverage industry, where dissolvable teacubeshave replaced tea bags.</p> \n<p>The market\u2019s next focus will be on waterless sanitary products, which are expected to benefit several poor communities worldwide.</p> \n<h3>Events to impart environmental education</h3> \n<p>Global events are organized to educate, engage, and empower consumers and people visiting about a broad range of environmental issues. These events encourage discussions about the future of Earth throughart, designs, technology, music, and philosophy. Further, major environmental exhibitions, workshops, and talks about climate change are held to raise public awareness.</p> \n<p>Severalbrands use various strategiesto create awareness. For instance, Cartier plans to install a choral sculpture outside a popular gallery calling out for the preservation of different indigenous species. Visitors are encouraged to engage with various topics and become educated on pressing issues.</p> \n<p>Other brands are getting involved by hostingsustainablefashion exhibitions and bringing together environmentally conscious artists and designers. The aim is to showcase different talents andregenerativeproducts, thereby promoting sustainability.</p> \n<p>More brands should engage in ecologically sensitive topics and host educational workshops through B2C and B2B events. They must also ensure that these events are conducted in the mostenvironmentally friendlymanner possible.</p> \n<h3>Recession-resistant products designed for longevity</h3> \n<p>Everyday necessities are becoming more expensive for consumers because of the ongoing recession.Qualityproducts with a longer lifespan will entice budget-conscious shoppers to spend more.</p> \n<p>For instance, IKEA offers products that are easy to repair,extendablebeds for growing children, and easy-to-disassemble furniture. On the other hand, tech brands offer products made of durable materials such as silicon, aluminum, andrecycled bambooand wood, among others.</p> \n<p>The cosmetics industry has also jumped on board by designing reusable containers. Some brands, for example, sell bottles that can double down as vases, whilecandlesare sold in cups that can also be used to drink tea.</p> \n<p>In terms of longevity, the most common themes across industries are durability, inclusive design, and repairability. For example, a well-known brand sells long-lasting totebagsmade of water-resistant PVC fabric. Brands can successfully implement this concept by clearly communicating their values to consumers and educating them on the benefits of product longevity.</p> \n<h3>Conservation programs that promote biodiversity</h3> \n<p>Brands can promote biodiversity by protecting bees and other pollinators that aid in the restoration of land degraded by tree felling and overgrazing. Many brands are participating in the movement by getting involved in restoration projects, such as planting trees on desolate lands and supporting local beekeepers. At the same time, other brands are assisting women from low-income communities in startingbeekeepingbusinesses.</p> \n<p>Some companies are taking thebee-savingcause all the way to parliament. They call for a ban on bee-killing pesticides, while others donate a portion of sales from limited-edition campaigns to non-profit organizations.</p> \n<p>Some companies are utilizing AI to assist with tree planting plans for home gardens, designingbeekeepingprojects, and selling \u2018cryptobees\u2019 (virtual bee NFTs) to help fund natural reserve rewilding.</p> \n<p>More brands can help this cause by participating in conservation programs that educate people about pollinators and their impact on the natural ecosystem.</p> \n<h3>Criticism against the inflation reduction act</h3> \n<p>On August 16, 2022, a bill to reduce inflation was signed into law in order to steer the United States toward lower carbon emissions and make green energy more affordable. However, critics argue that these efforts will fall short of reaching the people most affected by climate change.</p> \n<p>The bill includes $360 billion to address the impact of industries on climate change, mitigate future energy price increases, and reduce greenhouse gas levels by 40% by 2030. An additional $60 billion has been set aside to make green energy more affordable, including electric vehicles andsolar panelsfor low-income communities.</p> \n<p>Many grassroots organizations have spoken out against the bill, claiming it does not address the needs of marginalized communities who live in polluted areas or lack access to clean energy. Some see this bill as a way to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while not fully addressing the pollution caused by the fossil fuel industry.</p> \n<p>As energy prices rise, businesses must transition to renewable energy sources and provide affordable, efficient, and easysolutions.</p> \n<h2>Actions for a sustainable future</h2> \n<p>Water can be saved significantly by offering everyday essentials in more water-efficient formats. Products with a long shelf-life will be preferred as the cost of living rises dramatically.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, businesses should plan events to raise awareness of environmental issues. Finally, brands may participate in conservation programs that aid in the restoration of the natural ecosystem.</p> \n"}]}

At the same time, they seek products that are sustainable and organic.</p> \n<p>Since brands generally connect with consumers online, they need to consider how consumer needs influence their marketing strategy and overall online presence.</p> \n<h2>Hyper-personalized fragrance</h2> \n<p>Consumers seek hyper-personalized fragrances, yet purchasing online creates a barrier in determining a fragrance best suited to an individual based on the consumers\u2019 inability to interact with the product directly.</p> \n<p>Discovery boxesare a great way to engage with consumers in a fun way and allow them to try several different fragrances before choosing a favorite. Discovery boxes are also great for gifting. Gift a discovery box and have the gift receiver choose a favorite and use a credit to purchase a whole bottle of their choice.</p> \n<h2>Power of simple</h2> \n<p>There is a rising interest for easy-to-understand, single-ingredient beauty products that are natural and sustainable\u2014these values absolutely also apply when it comes to fragrances. Usingnatural ingredientsappeals to consumers seeking a more sustainable lifestyle, and simplicity in language and marketing builds trust. In fragrance, this means easy-to-understand fragrance names, clear ingredient lists and information regarding sourcing.</p> \n<p>Single-ingredient or single-note fragrances appeal to those seeking a hyper-personalized experience by allowing them to layer to build their own scent. At the same time, this may be intimidating to some\u2014so offer content to educate consumers on layering scents.</p> \n<p>Here are some great scents to get you started\u2014fruity floral,luxury floral,andfloral citrus. And, of course, don\u2019t forgetfragrances for men.</p> \n<h2>ScentSocial</h2> \n<p>Younger audiences discover fragrances through social media, with 64% of consumers reporting that Instagram influences their purchases. Meanwhile, Tiktok has kickstarted interest in fragrances from Gen Z\u2014#PerfumeTok has over 1 billion views.</p> \n<p>TikTok is becoming the first touchpoint of fragrance for a younger generation who is more likely to purchase online than in stores. Brands must make themselves available with simple descriptions of scent profiles and inspiring stories. Often, brands collaborate with social media influencers to reach wider audiences.</p> \n<h3>Social media marketing</h3> \n<p>Social media marketing can be approached in many different ways. Each brand will have to test which platforms and types of campaigns and stories work best for them.</p> \n<p>New consumers want \u2018how to wear\u2019 and \u2018how to care\u2019 ideas and quirky nuanced narratives. The goal is to generate interest,build brand awareness, and educate consumers.</p> \n<h3>Social media community</h3> \n<p>Through social media, brands can forge more intimate links with consumers by building a community. The connection through direct-to-consumer communication builds an authentic relationship with consumers to develop strong brand loyalty.</p> \n<p>Consider a \u2018for community by community\u2019 approach to product development by asking your audience to be involved in decisions. For example, Commodity Fragrances in the US asked its community to decide the names for the fragrances in its new Scent Space trilogy.</p> \n<p>There are many other ways to get your community involved and feel connected to your brand, such as VIP clubs. Brands can also use VIP communities, Facebook groups, etc., to directly ask customers for feedback and advice on a product. Goldfield & Banks sent 2ml samples of its new Purple Suede fragrance to its VIP social community. As a result, they saw impressive conversion rates from consumers delighted by being included and, of course, by the product.</p> \n<p>Social media provides a unique opportunity to connect, build community and get feedback from actual customers. This relationship-building helps to create a positive brand image, authority and trust in the fragrance space. Also, it helps to develop products your customers are guaranteed to love.</p> \n<h2>Joy-inducing engagement</h2> \n<p>As consumers foster deeper emotional connections with brands on social platforms and online, brands are creating online worlds with charming illustrations and empathic visuals to resonate with customers.</p> \n<p>Considering the experiential nature of scent, the online fragrance experience can be dull and lacking in emotion. To fill the emotion gap, brands use creative and beautiful micro-visual experiences on social channels.</p> \n<p>Nurture an authentic communication channel. Don\u2019t talk directly about your product; instead, focus on what emotions consumers want to feel when wearing a scent.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>When building an e-commerce business, it\u2019s essential to consider the many online channels where customers will find and connect with your brand. In fragrance, where potential customers can\u2019t interact with and smell your product before purchasing, it\u2019s crucial to find other ways to communicate your brand story and scents.</p> \n<p>Regarding product development, make personalization a priority\u2014discovery boxes and single ingredient fragrances allow for easy customization. Make it easy for consumers to understand info online while remembering the joy good visuals can bring. Connect with customers through social channels, particularly Gen Z first-time users.

Brands must adapt, be creative, experiment, and use technology to rise to the challenge.</p> \n<p>Despite the economic downturn, the global cosmetic industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of5.2%to US $50.28 billion by 2028. According to the NPD group, lipstick is the fastest growing segment in the cosmetic category, with sales increasing by 48% to US $222.2 million in 2022.</p> \n<p>So read on to learn about the keymakeup trendsthat will dominate the market in 2025.</p> \n<h2>6 Beauty trends leading to the future</h2> \n<h3>Bold and clean beauty movement</h3> \n<p>Beauty products that allow users to experiment with colors, such as advanced pigmented color palettes, will see a rise in usage. As more brands transition to skincare-infused cosmetics, allcolor palettes, including dyes and pigments, will be made of natural ingredients that are free from harmful chemicals. Some companies have already made the switch by offering lip colors made from plant-based Phyto pigments rather than artificial dyes.</p> \n<p>There will be a surge in non-traditional beauty looks inspired by meta-face aesthetics, with bright embellishments and chromatic colors leading the way. This statement-worthy appearance will become more common as more brands embrace the shift and provide cosmetics that allow users to create looks inspired by digital world aesthetics.</p> \n<p>Products that combine clean beauty with modern aesthetics will rise to prominence, such as high-pigment vegan eyeshadow palettes in vibrant tones, metallics and matte finishes, and cremehighlighterswithshimmeringundertones.</p> \n<p>Clean cosmetics must be accompanied by environmentally friendly packaging, as consumers increasingly prefer refillable, reusable, or recyclable packaging. Axiology provides zero-waste lip balm lids, whereas Rose Inc providesveganlip colors in refillable and reusable packaging.</p> \n<p>Customers will seek certifications for beauty products claiming they arecleanbecause they want assurance from reputable sources. Furthermore, trans-seasonal and versatile color palettes that provide all-around glam will support the sustainable cause in the long term.</p> \n<h3>Space-inspired beauty</h3> \n<p>Taking a cue from metaverse-inspired beauty, cosmetics that draw inspiration from the universe will find new market opportunities. As space tourism becomes a reality, forward-thinking brands will embrace the concept and develop strategic beauty designs suitable for all types of travel.</p> \n<p>Even though space travel is a niche luxury category, it encourages brands to develop innovative formulations in the long run. Estee Lauder, for example, launched ten bottles of its face cream into space via NASA\u2019s spacecraft to support and develop commercial space stations.</p> \n<p>Brands that develop solutions based on space travel constraints will be successful. For example, Allyoop provides asmudge-freeand waterproofeyeshadowstick that contains natural oils to lock in moisture and a liquid-filled makeup-removing swab at the tip to remove makeup.</p> \n<p>Waterless products such as makeup removers that do not require water use will gain popularity. Further, ready-to-go cosmetic swatches that instantly apply pigments to the lids will be popular. Finally, space-inspired aesthetics such as Ariana Grande\u2019s Space-themed r.e.m beauty will also make it to the top.</p> \n<h3>Minimalist makeup</h3> \n<p>Consumers will be drawn to cosmetics that prioritize skin health first andhybridmakeup that provides a whole routine in a few minutes. This is because many people will abandon unrealistic filters in favor of a bare-bones approach. Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s kit allows users to achieve full glam in just three steps.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, brands embracing healthy skin by normalizing freckles and introducing products that highlight beauty marks will be popular. Andfoundationsthat resemble natural skin tones will see success.</p> \n<p>Gen Z customers will be drawn to skincare-forward makeup that nourishes the skin and can be worn while sleeping. Leading the way will be products that are free of soap, have naturally nourishing ingredients like plant extracts, and can be gently removed with water.</p> \n<p>The no-makeup-makeup-look trends will also influence the minimalist aesthetic, and cosmetics with subtle tints that give skin ahealthyglow will be in demand.</p> \n<p>Future products will emphasize glossy,lightweightformulations rather than full coverage as more consumers embrace natural beauty. For instance, YSL\u2019s bare look tint made of nourishing ingredients leaves a light stain on the lips and cheeks. Finally, clear makeup that is in line with minimalist aesthetics, such as clear lip gloss that provides a high shine, will be popular.</p> \n<h3>Makeup for all age groups</h3> \n<p>As beauty becomes more inclusive, pro-aging messaging should replace negative aging narratives. For example, the Canadian age-positive brand 19/99 believes that age should not define beauty and offers multipurpose products for everyone.</p> \n<p>However, the desire for self-expression does not negate the desire to maintain a youthful appearance. The global anti-aging cosmetic market is expected to expand at a5.8%CAGR. Thus, pro-ageskincare-infusedmakeup will appeal to this demographic.</p> \n<p>Brands that use an age-positive approach in their campaign\u2019s messaging, formulations, and design will be popular among the older demographics. Laura Geller Beauty provides a curated selection of eye cosmetics with step-by-step instructions. Olay\u2019seasy-to-usecosmetics and Rare Beauty\u2019s grip-friendly designs are prime examples of brands catering to different demographics.</p> \n<h3>Affordable minis</h3> \n<p>Driven by the cost of living crisis and the shift to online shopping,miniatureversions of full-sized makeup will become a mainstay, making premium items more accessible. With global online beauty sales increasing by16.5%and67%of consumers now shopping differently, brands must adapt and leverage the digital shoppingexperience.</p> \n<p>Trialkits andminisallow users to test products without committing, resulting in higher satisfaction and less waste from incorrect purchases. Sephora has a dedicated minis section, whereas K-beauty offers complimentary minis with primary purchase.</p> \n<p>Brands must implement sustainable packaging to ensure thatminisdo not generate waste. They can accomplish this by providing single-dose products packaged with recycled paper as well as sample jars made of recycled green tea fibers.</p> \n<p>According to Euromonitor, beauty samples are the third most important factor driving sales. As part of a loyalty program that sees a 30% repeat purchase, Smashbox allows users to choose twosamplesafter making a purchase.</p> \n<h3>All-inclusive designs</h3> \n<p>The industry is moving towardinclusivity, and the demand for full representation is non-negotiable where the products are accessible to all. Even though the beauty industry has made strides to serve marginalized groups, more work is required because15%of the world\u2019s population lives with some form of disability and has been largely overlooked.</p> \n<p>Productswith grip-friendly designs and online tutorials for the visually impaired will fare well in the market. Hiring influencers with disabilities will also help to dispel negative stereotypes and gain the approval of many millennials.</p> \n<p>Brands that incorporate a universal design with products that are easy to open and use will be impactful. Procter & Gamble, for example, has stated that by 2025, it will make its products more accessible to people with disabilities, with easy-to-usecosmetics, tactile markings, and braille labels to identify different products quickly.</p> \n<h2>Dynamics that will define the future of makeup</h2> \n<p>The metaverse will dominate beauty conversations with shoppers seeking a fully immersive and interactive experience. Virtual realities should be prioritized to provide for customers seeking something novel and exciting.Millennials will gravitate toward brands that offer a diverse range of cosmetics for all individuals. Plastics and harmful chemicals will be phased out in favor of new and inventive formulas.

Move beyond being vegan</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s no longer enough to simply avoid using animal products; brands must now make active pledges to be reef-safe or carbon positive and back up those pledges with total transparency.</p> \n<p>Reef-safebeauty productsare rising in awareness and have shown a 2.6% increase on social media.

You could even feel as though you will miss them dearly once you return to reality.</p> \n<p>The good news is that thanks to the advancements in eye and cheek makeup, the digital experience is about to come to life, so you will probably encounter many of those looks in real life soon. Read on to learn more about how the trend is influencing and advancing eye and cheek cosmetic products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsHow well the cosmetics sector is performing?Eye and cheek makeup trends for 2023/24Explore the dernier-cri in cosmetics</p> \n<h2>How well the cosmetics sector is performing?</h2> \n<p>Similar to many other industries that heavily relied on retail fronts, the global cosmetic business saw a substantial decline in 2020 as a result of the disruption to the global health sector, as well as the widely enforced requirements for individual quarantine and social distance.</p> \n<p>Although the industry was close to a 25% dip at the time, analysts were hopeful about a steady rebound between 2021 and 2028, attaining a compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 5.2%. Given that makeup is all about improving one\u2019s look and is mostly applied on the face, the face category is undoubtedly the one with the most notable growth that businesses can draw attention to and is still anticipated to account for the largest market share.</p> \n<p>In addition, eye makeup products, among the cosmetics grouped under the face segment, have experienced significant development in light of the widespread use of facial masks, which have now grown to be considered essential in many parts of the world. The entire market value of eye makeup products is anticipated to increase by around $10 billion,from $15.6 billion to $24.5 billionin 2029, at an anticipated CAGR of 5.8% between 2021 and 2029.</p> \n<h2>Eye and cheek makeup trends for 2023/24</h2> \n<h3>Shiny new look</h3> \n<p>Over the past 1,000 days, face masks have been a regular part of our lives. This has unwittingly resulted in the attention on eye areas in style. As long as people are still wary about potential self-care issues, and are still utilizing masks as their first line of defense, makeup that emphasizes the eyes area will continue to be the major attention grabber.</p> \n<p>For this reason, in terms of textures, shimmer andglitter eyeshadoware much more favorable in accentuating the eyes area compared to the traditionalmatte eyeshadow, which is shimmer-free and does not reflect any changes under the light.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, as depicted in the picture above,cream-based eyeshadowis among the three main types of eyeshadow formulations along with the most traditionalpowder eyeshadowand the newer formula ofliquid eyeshadow. According to anexpert makeup artist,liquid-based eyeshadowis the most frequently used to enhance the shimmer or glitter effect as it is often more pigmented, which is exactly the main focus of the upcoming spring/summer seasons in 2023/24.</p> \n<p>As a general rule of thumb, higher pigment presents a truer and more vibrant color tone appearance on the skin and is hence able to better set off the shimmer and dazzling effects of the eyeshadow, which are greatly desired in 2023/24 for the eye makeup. In other words, the emphasis of the next season at the start of 2023\u20132024 will not only be on shiny eye cosmetics but also onmakeup products with highly pigmented colors.</p> \n<h3>Multi-use cream</h3> \n<p>Multi-use cream applicable on both eye and cheek is in fact not something new but has existed for quite a while. The fact that many renowned worldwide beauty brands carry such multifunctional creams proves not only that they are well-received among consumers but also the practicability behind them. The need for such multi-use cosmetics products was intensified by the popularity ofthe minimalist lifestylein recent years combined with the wide usage of face masks and social distancing policies that greatly reduced face-to-face interactions. People rely on thesemulti-use makeup setsto streamline their makeup routine while also staying more creative in self-identity presentation.</p> \n<p>As shown in the picture above, most of thesemultipurpose cosmetics productsprovide 3-in-1 solutions that can be used on eyes, cheeks, and lips to serve as blush, lipstick, or lip gloss as well as eyeshadow. As the line between the cheek and eye categories continues to blur in 2023/24, such multifunction makeups enable the users to experiment with harmonious color tones and formats on their face, thereby easily creating a matching, balanced and natural color scheme on facial features.</p> \n<p>Another obvious added feature for sucha multi-use makeup productis that it is much more suitable and convenient to carry along, especially when one is traveling, and it is greatly generic to be applicable across different ages and skin types.</p> \n<h3>Future colors</h3> \n<p>Remember the attractive metaverse avatar colors that captivate your attention? These virtual space-inspired color tones are the future colors that may very well lead the upcoming makeup product color tones in 2023/24, way beyond the 2022/23 makeup trends. And almost certainly, these colors are more on the vivid, vibrant side, as a positive reflection following the previous two years of global health worries and worldwide wellness concerns.</p> \n<p>WGSN, a B2B information provider on consumer and design trends, released a joint research list of upcoming color tones in mid-2022, together with Coloro, the coloring system joint venture between China Textile Information Center\u00a0(CTIC) and the international B2B information provider Ascential.

While it may be possible to test out these new colors with the manufacturers forcustomized color tone makeup such as eyeshadowduring the customized product development discussions, a feasibility check should be conducted to confirm that the desired new colors are compatible across multiple substrates.</p> \n<p>And of course, another way to explore more different colors for the market response is to offer multi-color tones products, such as this99 colorseyeshadow or even this194 colors eyeshadowmakeup.

The species and varieties vary from region to region and offer similar but not identical benefits.</p> \n<p>The most commonly used sea moss is Chondrus crispus, also known as Irish moss, that\u2019s found in colder climates along rocky coastal regions in the North Atlantic.</p> \n<p>Eucheuma cottonii and Gracilaria are sea mosses that are found in tropical climates along the coastlines of South America, Africa and some Asian regions.</p> \n<p>Seaweed is also considered an algae and can also be included in the category of sea moss. There are already so many amazing seaweed products on the market, likeseaweed shampooandseaweed face cleanser.</p> \n<p>When using sea moss, it\u2019s important to clearly communicate which species is being used and how they align with the product\u2019s intended function.</p> \n<h2>Sea moss and sea ingredients beauty trends</h2> \n<p>Sea moss has seen a consistent rise in search trends since 2021 and has become popular in recent months as it\u2019s gained prominence on social media. The global market for algae products is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% between 2022\u20132029 to reachUS $305.3 millionby 2029.</p> \n<p>Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian have boosted sea moss\u2019s popularity which started as an edible health booster in green smoothies and supplements. Now, videos on TikTok under the hashtag#SeaMosshave also begun discussing its beauty benefits.</p> \n<p>The sea moss market in beauty and wellness is currently dominated by independent sellers who promote locally and authentically sourced products.</p> \n<p>Other sea ingredients are also seeing continued growth in the beauty market.

Studies have shown that sea moss supports our overallhealthand wellness, includingimmune functionandgut health.</p> \n<p>But why use sea moss in beauty products?</p> \n<p>Due to its nutrient profile, reported skincare benefits of sea moss include boosting hydration, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, protecting the skin barrier, and balancing oil production. However, more research is necessary to fully understand the beauty benefits of sea moss.</p> \n<h2>Ethically sourcing sea moss</h2> \n<p>Sea moss has a long history of being used as a traditional holistic remedy that\u2019s rooted in local cultural practices.</p> \n<p>In Ireland and the Caribbean, sea moss has been used for centuries as a herbal medicine for ailments and to boost fertility. During thepotato famine in the 1800s, sea moss was made into a drink to combat nutritional deficiencies and is still used to boost health in Ireland today.</p> \n<p>Sourcing sea moss for beauty products should be done with respect to and in partnership with local communities to establish a connection with nature, culture, and tradition. One way to do this is to advocate for local sourcing and ensure that sea moss is harvested sustainably to ensure regeneration and avoid over-farming and damaging natural habitats.</p> \n<h3>Sustainable sourcing options for sea moss</h3> \n<p>Sea moss is farmed and harvested through various means, and with each method, it\u2019s important to consider sustainability.</p> \n<p>Wildcrafted sea moss grows naturally and is taken directly from the sea. While this is claimed to yield the most nutritional benefits, there is the potential issue of overfarming and disrupting the natural ecosystem. Sea moss harvested from the sea should be regulated and done in conjunction with locals who are knowledgeable about sustainable methods and the delicate ecosystem.</p> \n<p>Sea farms producing ocean-farmed sea moss grow good quality moss and provide vital jobs and support local industries, particularly where fishing is prohibited.

This article covers the latest trends from minimalism to affordability and \u2018dupes\u2019 and provides eco-friendly solutions.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsOverview of the budget beauty marketBeauty on a dimeBeauty ideas for the future</p> \n<h2>Overview of the budget beauty market</h2> \n<p>The global beauty industry was valued atUS$ 511billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.76% from 2022 to 2026. Even if the market appears lucrative, sellers must consider the rising cost of living expenses and provide affordable solutions.</p> \n<p>Multipurpose products that eliminate the need for multiple skincare items are in high demand. Customers want inexpensiveskincarealternatives that are free of chemicals and sulfates. There is a trend toward all-natural, sustainable, and reasonably priced products. Brands that adapt to rising living costs appeal to a broader audience.</p> \n<h2>Beauty on a dime</h2> \n<h3>Affordable skincare alternatives</h3> \n<p>With the rising cost of everyday necessities, many consumers will seek moreaffordablealternatives. This is evidenced by a 40% increase in Google searches for \u2018dupe\u2019 products, particularly in the beauty category, in June 2022. Social media influencers are mainly driving the dupe culture for affordable alternatives to luxury products.</p> \n<p>Many viral videos of dupe try-on have circulated on Tik Tok, which is quickly becoming a tool for advertising. Influencers add brand reviews, increasing exposure and driving sales. Many customers rely on reviews to help them make an informed decision and get the most out of their money. Affordable skincare solutions made of all-natural ingredientsfree of chemicals, parabens, sulfates, and silicone are in high demand.</p> \n<p>Other customers use websites to compare prices and find the bestaffordablealternatives to popular products. Brandefy, for example, is a popular consumer app that includes a dupe score to indicate similarity. The product similarity is calculated using four key factors: ingredients, consistency, wear time, and fragrance.</p> \n<p>When it comes to dupes,transparencyis essential because consumers want to know the key ingredients in each product, including percentages and functions, to build trust and make an informed decision.</p> \n<h3>Commitments to the community</h3> \n<p>Amid the rising costs and inflation, it is not safe to say that the beauty industry will be untouched. Many customers appreciate brands that aretransparentabout their challenges and can build trust and loyalty. As the beauty industry braces for impending inflation, brands are forced to make pricing and packaging decisions while keeping in mind the rising cost of living.</p> \n<p>Price increases are also standard, as seen in P&Ghair careproducts in 2021. They stated on social media that the price of certain products would rise due to rising ingredient and manufacturing costs. Deciem, on the other hand, offered customers the opportunity to purchase products at the original price two weeks before the prices rose.</p> \n<p>While some brands raise their prices, others lower them through strategic planning. For example, Rita Hazan, a hair brand, reduced its prices by replacing expensive fragrances in the formulations to make the range more accessible. Thus, it is important to note whetherbrandsacknowledge consumers\u2019 challenges.</p> \n<p>In this volatile environment, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work, and as a result, one must recognize the various challenges and provide adequate solutions.Brandsthat communicate their issues to customers can build trust. For example, Upcircle, a British brand, has pledged to assist consumers in dealing with cost-of-living challenges by providing a guide and using its platform to share money-saving tips.</p> \n<h3>Eco-friendly solutions</h3> \n<p>According to an EY survey, nearly 32% of consumers are concerned about affordability, and47%believesustainableproducts are more expensive, making purchasing difficult. With this conundrum, many brands attempt to strike the proper balance between affordability and sustainability. According to another survey,65%of respondents believe that brands should do more to provide sustainablesolutions. As a result, many businesses are turning torefillablesolutions and water-saving products, among other things.</p> \n<p>A wave of new brands is incorporating no-water formats into their products, thereby saving water. Alterna and Kao, for example, are brands that use powders instead of cream-based solutions and offer shampoosheetsthat do not require water. Another brand, Drybath, sells waterless body gels that help remove dirt and dead skin cells without water.</p> \n<p>Products that require very little water help mitigate water costs as consumers seek affordable solutions. For example, Lush\u2019s waterless oral care range requires only a tiny amount of water. These products are also ideal for people who live in areas where water is expensive or inaccessible and those who enjoy outdoor activities such as camping.</p> \n<p>In the long run, personal care products that use less water and prioritizesustainabilitywill appeal to a larger audience. Brands like Nope. are gaining popularity for theirenvironmentally friendlysolutions, such as their waterless, plastic-free shampoo and conditionerbars, which are said to last three times longer than a regular bottle. Meanwhile, Add Aqua is another brand that sells powder-to-foam hand wash and shampoo that provides four times the number of washes than a standard liquid product.</p> \n<h3>Minimal skincare routine</h3> \n<p>Minimalism has permeated the beauty industry, with multipurpose products replacing multi-step skincare routines. This concept saves money and time, which many shoppers appreciate. Many retailers, including Bath & Beyond, Boots, and Superdrug, embrace this concept and focus on cost-effective solutions for their customers.</p> \n<p>Understanding what consumers want is critical to providing practical solutions at reasonable prices. For example, Johnson & Johnson launched a new clean beauty care linefree of parabens, dyes, and sulfates, which aligns with millennials\u2019 modern values.</p> \n<p>Explore all-in-one products that assist consumers in reducing the number of products they own. Furthermore,nourishingproducts that are clean,all-natural, free of harmful ingredients, and can be used all across beauty routines are excellent alternatives to costly multi-step formulas.</p> \n<h3>The beauty factor</h3> \n<p>Despite the economic downturn, there is a market for consumers looking to splurge on minor indulgences. According to Leonard Lauder of the Estee Lauder company, smaller, more affordable luxuries such aslipsticksincrease sales during inflation. This is also true for otherbeautyproducts such asperfumes. This is evidenced by a 16% increase in Prestige beauty sales in Q2 2022, driven primarily by higher-income earners.</p> \n<p>A variety of affordable beauty products must be prioritized for low and middle-income earners.</p> \n<p>While people spend money on small luxuries, brands must prioritize customer experience so shoppers can make the most of their money during a recession. Many businesses are responding to the challenges by launching different programs to improve customer experience.</p> \n<p>One program involves using miniatures in the store for customers to try on before making a purchase. CVS, for example, introduced an on-site skin diagnostic program to assist customers in making informed decisions.</p> \n<h2>Beauty ideas for the future</h2> \n<p>Customers value transparency, so pricing decisions and their reasons should be communicated. Furthermore, special virtual and in-store events, giveaways, and discounts are excellent ways to keep customers loyal.</p> \n<p>Because many customers are experiencing difficulties as a result of the financial crisis, products with high value and multiple benefits will be preferred. Brands that launch customer-assisted programs to address economic challenges will dominate the market.</p> \n<p>Many individuals are looking to simplify theirbeautyroutine in order to avoid spending exuberant amounts on multiple products. As a result, multipurpose beauty products are currently popular. And lastly, because sustainable alternatives are more expensive than traditional counterparts, providing cost-effective solutions is critical.</p> \n"}]}

Thepremiumbeauty market increased by 15% as a result of the entry of new brands catering specifically to the Latina community.</p> \n<p>The notable categories include haircare products, including shampoos and gels, as well as hygiene products and cosmetics, including eyelashes,perfumes, and powders.</p> \n<h2>Mexico\u2019s beauty products</h2> \n<h3>Straightforward beauty care</h3> \n<p>Many consumers are daunted by the abundance of skincare products on the market, as well as the elaborate routines. As a result, some companies are simplifying the skincare routine by introducing multipurpose solutions made fromnatural ingredients.</p> \n<p>One Mexican brand that stands out in this regard is Raw Apothecary, known for products made of natural ingredients such as seeds, flowers, and plants that are sustainably sourced.

Aside from the zesty scents, there is a strong emphasis on the packaging, which encourages upcycling and reuse.</p> \n<p>Many bottles are handcrafted to createattractivedesigns that can also be used as interior decor.

Increasingly, consumers are looking for effective skincare solutions that feature post-natural ingredients that won\u2019t irritate sensitive skin and help preserve its youthful glow.Moisturizing serumsare a good example of how antioxidants and peptides can replenish, protect, and soothe the skin.</p> \n<h3>Anti-perfectionism</h3> \n<p>The beauty industry has long been dominated by Western ideals of beauty; skin that is porcelain white and hair with perfect ringlets. Indian consumers, especially women, are now rejecting these unrealistic beauty standards and seeking out products likeorganic anti-acne creamsthat help them cope with their skin conditions and flaws instead of attempting to hide them.</p> \n<h3>Feminine care boom</h3> \n<p>The empowerment of women and increased awareness about sexual health and hygiene have boosted demand for feminine care products that address issues such as vaginal dryness or incontinence. A good example is thereusable menstrual cup, which can be used by women during their periods instead of disposable pads or tampons.</p> \n<h3>Beard culture</h3> \n<p>Beards have become increasingly common among Indian men, who see facial hair as a way to express masculinity. Beards are also seen as a sign of virility and good health. This beard culture will cause an increase in the demand forjojoba oils, which help prevent dryness and keep bears soft and shiny.Beard waxesare also sought by many Indian men as they can help shape and tame the beard.</p> \n<h3>Ayurvedic staples</h3> \n<p>In recent years, Indian consumers have started to look for products that incorporate ayurvedic ingredients into their beauty routines. One example product on the market is thedetox face mask, which uses mango-ginger, Indian gooseberry, and red clay to create a nourishing and exfoliating mask and mud bath. Another interesting product is thefenugreek body oil, which is designed to soothe the skin while also having anti-inflammatory effects.</p> \n<h2>Thailand</h2> \n<p>Thailand is a key destination for the beauty industry, with consumers gravitating toward cosmeceuticals formulated with clean, natural, and herbal ingredients.

There is also an upsurge in the adoption ofelectrical hair massager brushes, which use radio-frequency (RF) and laser technology to help stimulate blood circulation and combat dryness and dandruff.</p> \n<h3>Tran-specific formulas</h3> \n<p>As the Thai trans community grows, so will the demand for products that address skin dehydration and hair loss associated with hormone replacement therapies. The most relevant example of this trend isBrrylee, a water toner of rose petals that can help trans women to restore moisture and balance the skin\u2019s pH levels.</p> \n<h3>Reflection of culture</h3> \n<p>Thai consumers want to see their country\u2019s culture reflected in their personal care regimen. This is especially true when it comes to artisanal products like face masks. Thai consumers are interested in purchasingmud masksthat contain lemongrass, as the smell of this classic Thai ingredient evokes everything from a fine Thai meal to a bustling market.</p> \n<h3>Anti-aging</h3> \n<p>Thailand is one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world with alow fertility rate. This is creating new opportunities for anti-aging brands, such as those selling skincare products, cosmetics, and nutritional supplements. For example,pearl caviar beadshelp reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and dullness. They work by providing the face skin with a long-lasting supply of moisture and nutrition throughout the night.</p> \n<h2>Philippines</h2> \n<p>Up-and-coming beauty trends in the Philippines will be strongly focused on skin-illuminating products, natural ingredients, and quick and easy make-up application. This section explores the top four beauty trends sweeping across the Philippines.</p> \n<h3>Skinimalism</h3> \n<p>Skinimalism is a movement that focuses on the idea of having a natural look with minimum makeup usage.

This makes thereusable volcanic stonesa popular choice for women looking for makeup solutions that can be used on the go. These stones can absorb oil from the face and create clear skin without facial gloss.</p> \n<h3>Youth-centric skincare</h3> \n<p>The Philippines\u2019 thriving youth-centric skincare products market is one of the fastest growing in Asia, with women aged18 to 24accounting for the country\u2019s largest consumer base. These products address two common issues for teens and young adults: acne and uneven skin tone. Acne can be combated withelectric pore cleaners, which cleanse pores to remove dead skin cells that cause acne and blackheads.</p> \n<h3>Tanned skin</h3> \n<p>In the Philippines, there is a growing number of celebrities and beauty bloggers with dark olive skin tones who are helping to redefine what it means and looks like to be beautiful. And they\u2019re helping drive a trend toward more inclusive makeup products, fromfoundationsthat match dark skin tones tolipsticksthat flatter darker complexions.</p> \n<h3>Tropical beauty</h3> \n<p>The Philippines has a warm climate year-round, so it\u2019s only natural that consumers are looking for beauty products that can keep them cool and refreshed. Consequently, brands should consider addingsoothing gelsandlotionswith hydrating ingredients like aloe vera or hyaluronic acid to their skincare lines. These ingredients are known to be effective at keeping skin soft and fresh while not feeling greasy.</p> \n<h2>Vietnam</h2> \n<p>Vietnam\u2019s beauty market is witnessing a move towards a natural and clean beauty culture, and leading the way are young consumers who are eager but calculated spenders in the region. The following are some of the key trends that can help brands gain an edge in this emerging market.</p> \n<h3>S\u01b0\u01a1ng s\u01b0\u01a1ng skin</h3> \n<p>The word \u201cs\u01b0\u01a1ng s\u01b0\u01a1ng\u201d is a Vietnamese term that means \u201csuper light\u201d. This approach to makeup is all about light coverage that looks natural and focuses on the skin\u2019s health, rather than its appearance. For instance, thenourishing serumcontains Vitamins A and E, ingredients that are known for their ability to lighten spots, promote metabolism, prevent aging, and make the skin rosy and shiny.

This offers a great opportunity to promotedeep conditionersthat keep hair strands healthy and hydrated.</p> \n<h3>All-natural and organic</h3> \n<p>In Vietnam, the market is moving away from chemicals and towards morenatural beauty ingredients. The rise of social media has contributed to this shift by giving people access to information about products and their effects on the body. As a result, Vietnamese consumers have begun to prefer natural ingredients likecoconut oiland honey ormilk-based face masksover products containing parabens or phthalates.</p> \n<h3>K-wave movement</h3> \n<p>Vietnamese consumers are influenced by Korean culture, particularly through K-pop music and television shows. As a consequence, women are increasingly turning to whitening products to get the pale skin of their K-pop stars.Lightening skin creamscan help achieve a brighter complexion and smoother texture while also helping to reduce dark spots or blemishes.</p> \n<h2>It\u2019s all about culture</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, beauty trends for South and Southeast Asian countries are driven by each country\u2019s culture and history.

While this may be applicable on a global scale, there is, however, one singular exception:South Korea.</p> \n<p>South Korean men have long embraced the men\u2019s grooming trend way before the recent growth. In fact, according toCNN, it had already surpassed all other countries in the globe in terms of skincare spending over the previous 10 years, from 2010 to 2020. Let\u2019s find out what this global market leader for men\u2019s grooming products has in store for us in 2023!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhy K-grooming?K-grooming guides for trendy male products in 2023Beyond \u00e0 la mode</p> \n<h2>Why K-grooming?</h2> \n<p>You may have heard of K-pop, K-drama, and even K-beauty, so by now, you have probably been able to deduce what is K-grooming here. It is essentially the same as K-beauty but with an emphasis on men\u2019s grooming products, led mainly by a large group of passionate male consumers in South Korea. To be precise, based on the latest study fromOpensurvey, they represent 8 out of 10 males between 20 and 49, who regularly use skin care products while also routinely getting grooming products at least once every two months.</p> \n<p>Better still, almost all of them made their buying decision by themselves, as 75.6% of them were involved in the product choosing process, and 80% of them purchased online. With such a high penetration rate of men\u2019s grooming products among its targeted consumers, it certainly seems unwise to source male grooming products without first taking a look at the trends in South Korea.</p> \n<h2>K-grooming guides for trendy male products in 2023</h2> \n<h3>Be gender-inclusive</h3> \n<p>According to thisonline dictionary, the term gender-inclusive basically means to accept and include individuals of all genders. In terms of the Korean beauty industry, this is certainly something that has already been widely adopted. From hydrating masks to sunscreen with SPF of 50+ and facial cleansers, plenty of Korean skincare products already have theirgender-neutral versions released.</p> \n<p>However, with the recent success of a few relatively new Korean grooming firms, namelyBTSO (Born To Stand Out)and Sequence, which passionately embrace the gender-inclusive concept through their innovative products, the notion of gender-inclusive is now being transcended to a whole new level. As Korean men usher in many beauty products that were once considered \u201cfor girls\u201d or \u201cfemale-only,\u201d cosmetic items such asBB creamandconcealersare now offered with gender-inclusive options too.</p> \n<p>It is worth noting that when it comes to such cosmetics items, men tend to choose foundation products that blend in more naturally with their skin for adequate natural coverage and to look closer to their natural skin tone. Most guys who need to spend a lot of time outdoors or who are physically active also favor cosmetic products with a lighter texture and longer-lasting effects for a simpler regimen. For example, they may choose a BB cream with features as shown in the picture below:</p> \n<h3>Be replenishable</h3> \n<p>During the projection period of 2022\u20132027, it is anticipated that the worldwide market for organic skincare products will expand at a compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 8.72%. The primary driving forces for such a continuous expansion are the rise in consumer knowledge of health and well-being over the last two years as well as the expansion of environmental concerns. Indeed, skincare and beauty products with natural ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and alpha hydroxy acid are now widely available.</p> \n<p>Despite their higher price tags, these products continue to be in great demand among customers who are becoming more and more health-conscious. Nevertheless, astute marketers have also moved quickly to provide consumers with more alluring alternatives to make up for this portion of the cost by offering both recyclable and refillable products. As usual, K-beauty is among the forerunners in embracing novel ideas, such as thisnew store that totally switched to refillable productsin 2021 and allows customers to bring their own bottles for refill.</p> \n<p>The same development is gradually spreading to Korean men\u2019s grooming products, as shown on several top Korean brands, including Black Monster, which has gained fame innumerous reviewssince 2018. It has so far released many refillable items that are easy to disassemble and replenish. Indeed,refillable containers for beauty products, especially those with substantial size and elegant design, may not only look attractive to the users but also prove to be extremely useful and long-lasting.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, an environmentally friendly skincare container that is also refillable, like atravel-size squeezable dispenseror anairless pump bottleas seen in the image above, is perhaps even more appealing and practical at the same time to the consumers.</p> \n<h3>Be wholly</h3> \n<p>While gender inclusivity is unmistakably a key theme among the K-grooming trends that are progressively evolving, it is essentially a step towards a larger goal\u2014expanding product offerings. For instance, a men\u2019s grooming line for facial care can go beyond the typicalface cleanserto include toner and lotion, as seen in the image below. It may also be expanded to much more, such as eye cream,oil cleanser,perfume, or even a men\u2019s makeup series, all in an effort towards a more comprehensive product line expansion for customer retention rate and loyalty.</p> \n<p>Grafen, a K-grooming brand that was once viewed mainly as specialized inhair care products, for example, has successfully reinvented itself to be an A-Z product expert in men\u2019s grooming products in recent years. They are now offering fragrance, styling tools, and body care products, aside from their standard skincare and cosmetic collections.</p> \n<p>Even those who stick with their original product focus are expanding their product line by including more options.Be Ready, the Korean brand under Amorepacific, which includes a great variety of foundation shades, is one such example that thrived with stellar results.</p> \n<p>Therefore, instead of sticking to the basic face care products, expand the product line to include things likemoisturizing creamandanti-aging skincare cream. The majority of Korean brands can expand their product offerings by introducing something distinctively known as \u201cKorean skincare routines,\u201d which are frequently accompanied by step-by-step instructions that can be really helpful to male customers who are less experienced with the world of beauty products.</p> \n<h2>Beyond \u00e0 la mode</h2> \n<p>Sure enough, beauty products or any grooming products for men were once viewed solely through the prism of fashion. These days, however, due to the increasing acceptance and the rise in men\u2019spersonal careconcerns, these goods are shedding their image as fashion items and are becoming actual day-to-day essentials. The three K-grooming product directions\u2014gender-inclusive products, replenishable packaging, and an extensive line of products\u2014may serve as leading indicators for the overall development trend in men\u2019s grooming in 2023. Based on these Korean men\u2019s grooming ideas and a careful examination of the vast selection provided on Alibaba.com, wholesalers may seize the opportunity to capitalize on the steadily growing demand for men\u2019s grooming solutions.</p> \n"}]}

According to a report by Statistica, the global haircare market was valued at$90.19 billionin 2020 and is expected to reach $102.49 billion by 2024. This growth can be attributed to consumers\u2019 desire for healthy hair that enhances their appearance.</p> \n<p>Maintaining healthy hair has become a gateway to overall well-being. Consumers are no longer satisfied with simply buying any old shampoo or conditioner. They want products that align with their lifestyle choices and aspirations. The following sections will explore 5 trends that will dominate the haircare industry in 2024.</p> \n<h2>Hair minimalism</h2> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their beauty habits. According to2019 Nielsen data, 73% of consumers said they want to reduce their impact on the environment, and 38% claimed that sustainability is an important factor when purchasing beauty products. Consumers will be looking for multifunctional products such astwo-in-one shampoos, which allow them to remove more than one product from their haircare routine. This saves them time and effort, and it also reduces the amount of product waste.</p> \n<p>Products like themultifunctional hair straightenerwill appeal to women looking to achieve minimalist haircare rituals. This 5-in-1 hair styler combines severalbasic hair careroutines into one convenient tool. It uses PTC heat technology to protect hair from damage and is equipped with an anti-scalding comb to prevent hair pulling. Furthermore, it features a smooth roller design that allows for a variety of styles from straight to curly.</p> \n<h2>Scalp care: prevention is better than a cure</h2> \n<p>Hair loss remains a common problem for many people, particularly as they age. In fact, more than80 million peoplein the USA are suffering from hair loss, and it\u2019s no surprise that two-thirds of men will experience some form of hair loss by the age of 35. As such, products that can help prevent hair loss will become more relevant and in demand as the focus of consumers shifts from treatment to prevention.</p> \n<p>In terms of hair care and preventing hair loss, there is no better ingredient thanMoroccan Argan oil. It hydrates the scalp and enhances the elasticity in the strands, which helps promote healthy hair growth. For example, theanti-hair loss shampoo, which contains argan oil, is enriched with Vitamin E, antioxidants, fatty acids, and squalene. This advanced formula helps boost follicle strength and reduce breakage while also promoting healthy hair growth.</p> \n<h2>Well-being and haircare</h2> \n<p>As the connection betweenhealthy hair and a healthy bodybecomes more apparent, consumers are starting to incorporate haircare products into their daily routines as part of a holistic approach to overall well-being. This includes a focus on eating healthier, exercising more, and taking time for self-care. As a result, there will be a rising demand for edible haircare products to improve circulation, reduce stress levels, and strengthen the immune system.</p> \n<p>Hair gummies, for example, are a natural and delicious way to promote hair health and body wellbeing. They contain organic ginger, fermented turmeric, and black pepper, which promote general wellbeing throughout the body, but specifically, nourish the scalp and hair roots. In addition to edible products, there will be a focus on sensorial products such asmassage oilsandhair combs, which are designed to stimulate hair growth, improve blood circulation, and relieve body stress.</p> \n<h2>Curly and textured hair</h2> \n<p>As consumers becomemore educatedabout their unique hair needs, they will move away from one-size-fits-all products that claim to cater to all types of hair. Instead of focusing on Euro-centric beauty standards such as white and smooth hair, businesses need to personalize their haircare lines to meet the varied intersectional needs of consumers, such as those with curly, wavy, and afro-textured hairs.</p> \n<p>According todata from Solvay, over 65% of the world\u2019s population have curly or textured hair; and that may explain why products mentioning \u201ctextured\u201d in their packaging have jumped 55% since 2016. A lot of brands have started developing new products that are formulated specifically for coily hair types. For example,Locroyal Cosmeticsis a leading Chinese supplier that offers acoconut haircare setfor curly hair. The set includes a shampoo for relieving scalp dryness, a conditioner for balancing essential scalp moisture, a hair mask for providing the scalp with lasting nourishment, and a hair growth oil for strengthening dry and brittle hairs.</p> \n<h2>Skincare mimicry</h2> \n<p>In today\u2019s personal care market, consumers are looking for products that can help them maintain a youthful appearance from head to toe. This is especially true for those concerned about aging skin, as many feel that their hair will start to reflect their skin\u2019s condition. Consequently, skintellectual consumers are migrating toward skincare routines and formulas that resonate with their hair issues. For example, consumers are becoming more aware of the importance of cleansing their scalp from excess sebum buildup and dirt accumulation.</p> \n<p>This new shift in haircare habits means there will be an increased demand for hybrid products that treat both the body\u2019s skin and the hair simultaneously. A great example is theliquid collagen & biotin oil, which promotes hair growth and improves skin radiance. The active collagen ingredient maintains a healthy scalp environment as well as the shine, strength, and thickness of the hair. The biotin vitamin, on the other hand, helps to keep skin clear and radiant.</p> \n<h2>Getting started with haircare products</h2> \n<p>From these trends, it seems clear that consumers are becoming more health-conscious and minimalist in their approach to haircare. Armed with a knowledge of these industry insights, brands and businesses can start sourcinghaircare productsthat align with consumers\u2019 habits and lifestyles.

And broken down by region, the Asia-Pacific market will witness the most growth, being at the forefront of this trend.</p> \n<p>This means there\u2019s an opportunity for functional derma skincare brands with innovative products and services to capitalize on this expanding market.</p> \n<h2>5 functional derma skincare trends to boost sales</h2> \n<p>The following skincare solutions will offer your business a chance to stay relevant and boost its appeal to this booming market:</p> \n<h3>1.\u00a0 Personalized anti-aging skin care based on genetics</h3> \n<p>Skincare awareness is driving the surge for personalized products in the market.

Through bio-genetic research, skincare brands can develop functional skincare ingredients and products that make them stand out.</p> \n<p>For delicate skins, consider products developed with natural active ingredients likeasiaticoside.</p> \n<p>Asiaticoside products remove free radicals and boost collagen production, strengthening the skin. They also clear acne scars and stretchmarks, among many other benefits.</p> \n<p>They\u2019re gentle on the skin and work well withsalicylic acidandvitamin c serums. Along with the older demographics looking foranti-aging products, offering customized skincare products might also attract a younger demographic.</p> \n<p>The Gen Zs, for instance, prefer products with a futuristic and minimalistic appeal. That\u2019s because these derma products complement their eclectic aesthetics on social media.</p> \n<p>Providing such personalized products will attract the right customers and improve customer loyalty.</p> \n<h3>2.\u00a0 Specialization in innovative hyaluronic anti-aging skincare products</h3> \n<p>Skinimalism is trendingin the Asia-Pacific region as more consumers opt for brands with minimal messaging, simple skincare routines, and ingredients.</p> \n<p>This new trend focuses on simple and effective ingredients over quantity. That\u2019s why hero ingredient products likehyaluronic-basedproducts are in high demand. The global hyaluronic acid market wasUS $8.5 billion in 2020, with forecasts to grow at a 7.8% annual growth rate till 2028.</p> \n<p>Derma skin care businesses should capitalize on this trend by investing in hyaluronic products. The hyaluronic acid reduces the appearance of skin wrinkles and redness and moisturizes the skin to make it look supple.</p> \n<p>Hyaluronic acid works great withretinol, which according tothis studyis driving significant demand in the Chinese functional skincare market. This is because hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin while retinol strengthens it.</p> \n<p>Functional derma beauty brands should leverage this trend by combining both in their catalog.</p> \n<h3>3.

Businesses should understand the recurring skincare problems of consumers in the market, and only then will they be able to educate consumers on effective skincare solutions to their problems.</p> \n<p>When offering your products as solutions, emphasize the benefits of the ingredients. Explain the benefits of products likemoisturizersandfacial cleansers.

If your budget allows it, invite derma skincare experts to educate potential consumers over a webinar or live stream session.</p> \n<p>Do this to foster a trustworthy relationship with consumers, and keep them interested in your brand and loyal to your products.</p> \n<h3>4.\u00a0 Using AI to create personalized products</h3> \n<p>Globally, the artificial intelligence (AI) segment of the beauty and cosmetics market was valued atUS $2.7 billion in 2021and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.7% from 2022 to 2030.</p> \n<p>These figures reinforce the need for one to leverage AI in their functional skincare business to stay ahead of the curve.</p> \n<p>Functional derma skincare brands should use AI to analyze skin patterns to find possible underlying skin conditions. This can be done with face mapping technology to examine metrics like dark circles, acne distribution, and other blemishes.</p> \n<p>AI allows consumers to use their mobile devices for diagnostics instead of getting it in person from aestheticians. The technology uses generated data to understand the East Asian skin type better, helping you tailor products to consumer skin types.</p> \n<p>AI also analyzes consumers\u2019 feedback to understand their preferences. This is more precise than surveys because consumers aren\u2019t always good at analyzing their skin type.</p> \n<p>Also, one\u2019s skin type can change over time because of lifestyle and diet. AI tracks these changes and recommends products likeserumsortonersto match these changes.</p> \n<p>And finally, with an AI app, consumers can also try on derma beauty products virtually to see if they\u2019re a good fit, resulting in a better user experience overall.</p> \n<h3>5.\u00a0 Move towards home-based luxury beauty treatments</h3> \n<p>Since the skin loses its firmness over time, luxury derma beauty treatments may be able to revitalize the skin.</p> \n<p>As a functional derma skincare business, provide at-home luxury beauty services that mimic aesthetic procedures, likemesotherapy. Mesotherapy is the injection of vitamins and minerals on the skin\u2019s surface. It uses active ingredients to treat skin conditions, and it hydrates and heals damaged tissues.</p> \n<p>Other luxury beauty devices likefacial cleansing brushesandface toning devicescan help deep clean and massage the skin for a youthful glow.Facial rollersandLED face maskscan also reduce puffiness and stimulate collagen production.</p> \n<p>Offering luxury skincare services to consumers at home provides convenience that can boost your appeal to a broader range of customers.</p> \n<h2>Moving forward</h2> \n<p>Consumers are flocking to brands that provide effective products for their skin type and can adapt to their skin\u2019s changing needs.</p> \n<p>Skincare businesses can offer personalized solutions to customer skincare issues, which results in a more tailored approach that modern customers will love.</p> \n<p>Brands can also invest in made-to-order products, emphasize the active ingredients used, and increase product awareness with live streams and virtual idols to make interaction with the audience fun.</p> \n<p>These skincare trends and marketing approaches can help brands to boost their appeal and stay ahead in this competitive and dynamic market.</p> \n"}]}

And the total revenue for personal care products is predicted to reach the US $295 billion by 2026 as more people take personal health into their own hands.</p> \n<p>Hygiene practices and personal care routines adopted during that pandemic will help to boost this trend. Additionally, personal care products like deodorant that saw a dip in sales during the stay-home period will be brought back to life as people re-engage with social activities.</p> \n<p>Also, the types of products that consumers are looking for will change as they become more conscious of the ingredients in their personal care products.

Care for the oral microbiome has gained the attention of many, with #OralCareRoutine getting 4.4 million views on TikTok. According to Harvard Dental student Christina Xu, oral care will become increasingly crucial for those using e-cigarettes.

The global beauty devices market is expected to increase from US $42.2 billion in 2020 toUS $207.2 billionin 2027.</p> \n<h3>Progressive underarm care</h3> \n<p>The body positivity movement has significantly impacted the beauty market as it tackles previously considered unattractive topics, like body odor and body hair. In particular, attitudes toward body hair have shifted due to pro-body hair brands and a change in grooming routines during the pandemic. On TikTok, videos tagged #BodyHairPositivity have seen 100 million views, and young people now see body hair as sexy and empowering.</p> \n<p>People seek progressive underarm care such asdeodorant that is natural, good for their bodies, and good for the environment.</p> \n<p>As more people accept body hair, products will rise to treat hair growth issues, such as irritation andingrown hairs.

This has resulted in refocusing attention on products that are affordable and accessible to all.</p> \n<p>The market for menstrual products, including tampons, pads, menstrual cups, and vulva care (sensitive soapsandvulva repair products), is projected to grow from $38.18 billion in 2021 to$54.52 billionwith a growth rate of 5.22%.</p> \n<p>More people are turning to reusable products likeperiod underwearandmenstrual cups.

And, on TikTok, videos tagged #ArmpitDetox have seen over 7.6 million views.</p> \n<p>There is no official definition of clean beauty. However, certifications and stamps of approval will help gain trust when formulating products with natural ingredients and help people make the shift.</p> \n<p>Some organic products leading the market in the personal care category includeface creams,deodorant, andtoothpaste.</p> \n<h3>Sustainable & long-lasting products</h3> \n<p>To align with inclusivity and sustainability, personal care products are being redesigned to prioritize longevity and accessibility. Conscious consumers are prioritizing less waste to save money and protect the environment.</p> \n<p>One category within personal care where we see a significant impact is the razor market. Brands are moving away from single-use plastic razors to shaving products made from recycled or eco-friendly biodegradable materials such asbamboo.</p> \n<h2>Embrace the future of personal care</h2> \n<p>The market for personal care products is changing as people take their health and wellness into their own hands and their priorities shift to sustainable, eco-friendly products.

This is coupled with increasing interest from consumer\u2019s for the benefits these products offer. For businesses in the beauty and personal care industry that aim to capitalize on this market, this guide highlights four essential anti-aging skincare ingredients that will ensure one stays ahead in 2022.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket growth for anti-aging skincare productsHow to select anti-aging skincare ingredients?Boost your catalog today</p> \n<h2>Market growth for anti-aging skincare products</h2> \n<p>Consumers\u2019 obsession with skin health has left an increasing desire for smooth, tight, and glowing skin. As a result, visits to skin beauty businesses like spas and esthetician-led clinics are at an all-time high.</p> \n<p>Customers want a new look, and skincare manufacturers have the opportunity to increase profit. They can do that with increased interest in in-office treatments and at-home skincare routines, with good skincare products that focus on safe, effective ingredients.</p> \n<p>As the demand for skin care products rises, there\u2019s an opportunity for industry growth, with the global anti-aging skincare products market projected toreach US $88.3 billion between 2021 and 2026,at an annual growth rate of 7%. The U.S led this growth atUS $14.2 billion in 2020, accounting for a 27.04% share of the global market. The increase was due to a widespread desire to look younger, coupled with new product launches to meet this growing market demand.</p> \n<h2>How To Select Anti-aging Skincare Ingredients?</h2> \n<p>With anti-agingingredients seeing rapid growthin a range of beauty and personal care products, businesses can ensure their appeal by offering trending products that contain highly sought after ingredients. Knowing what consumers are looking for is essential to maintaining profits, and the following four products are set to be in high demand in 2022 and beyond.</p> \n<h3>1. Sunscreen products</h3> \n<p>As awareness of sunburn and its effects increases, standalone sunscreen products fail to meet rising consumers\u2019 needs. There\u2019s a significant increase in demand for sunscreen products with anti-aging properties. For this reason, the sunscreen products\u2019 market value willreach US $10.7 billionin the U.S by 2024.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s an opportunity for businesses to use this trend to boost product sales. More consumers use SPF to protect against loss of skin elasticity caused by over-exposure to sunlight. They can also use it to combat premature aging and skin cancer.</p> \n<p>The Skin Cancer Foundation reports thatSPFreduces the risks of skin cancer by40 to 50 percent, and it works for various skin types.</p> \n<p>According to theRealSelf Sun Safety Report, 53% of American men who use sunscreen reapply it almost every time. They do that to prevent skin cancer, and the same report shows that most Americans prefer using a moisturizer with SPF.</p> \n<p>A combination ofmoisturizer and SPFhelps keep moisture in the skin and protects it from the sun. SPF contains glycerin which hydrates and brightens one\u2019s skin, making it look younger.\u00a0 Businesses can therefore ensure they provide a combination of both in order to leverage this trend.</p> \n<h3>2. Collagen-boosting anti-aging products</h3> \n<p>The skin needs collagen for elasticity and firmness. Consumers\u2019 high demand for ingredients likeretinolis because it boosts collagen production. As one ages, skin cell regeneration slows down causing a dry and dull skin tone.</p> \n<p>Retinol containsvitamin Ewhich speeds up skin cell growth and reduces wrinkles. It also helps remove dark spots and age spots, giving one a beautiful complexion.</p> \n<p>Retinol used to be a nighttime ingredient, but it\u2019s also used in the daytime. According to A-list facialistSarah Chapman, one can apply retinol day and night to maintain its presence in the skin. This is important because its potency reduces each time it\u2019s exposed to the sun.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s also another reason businesses should include SPF in their skincare catalog. It offers an extra layer of protection and, when paired with retinol, maintains its effect on the skin.</p> \n<h3>3. Antioxidants</h3> \n<p>Antioxidants protect the skin from damage caused by UV rays and pollution. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps combat hyperpigmentation and hydrates the skin.Vitamin C serumis especially popular as it evens out one\u2019s skin tone, giving it a youthful glow.</p> \n<p>A side effect of aging is loose skin. Vitamin C serum also boosts collagen production, which helps tighten the skin. It prevents the formation of free radicals, which break down collagen and elastin. With time, this causes the acceleration of aging with signs like wrinkles, dry, and dull skin.</p> \n<p>Hyaluronic acid draws moisture from the air and holds it in the skin. Vitamin C serum paired with hyaluronic acid is a powerful ingredient combination. They are effective together in hydrating and repairing the damage done to the skin over time.</p> \n<p>Cosmetic antioxidants are seeing a rise in popularity. The market value is projected toreach US $158 million by 2025at a CAGR of 5.9%. This means that there\u2019s an opportunity here for businesses to capitalize on this by including vitamin C serums andhyaluronic acidin their skincare catalog.</p> \n<h3>4. Anti-aging moisturizers</h3> \n<p>The skin around the eyes is used for facial expressions and needs special care. Due to premature aging and stress, the eyes may also have bags and dark circles. Consumers useanti-aging eye cream moisturizersbecause it removes dark circles and puffiness around the eyes.</p> \n<p>They containniacinamidethat protects against UV rays. Niacinamides also clear acne, making the skin firm and healthy.</p> \n<p>They also help reduce redness and inflammation around the eyes, improving skin texture. They hydrate and nourish the skin, leaving it with a natural glow. And because the skin under the eyes is thin and delicate, niacinamides are particularly useful. They also offer a protective barrier between the skin and external pollution.</p> \n<p>Also, a combination of moisturizer andceramidescan be used to prevent acne and soothe the skin. They can be paired well with other skincare ingredients, and help to maintain skin integrity.</p> \n<p>The moisturizing cream market is projected to reachUS $12.22 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 4.45%. This means there\u2019s room for businesses that provide different types of anti-aging moisturizers to appeal to a broader range of customers.</p> \n<h2>Boost your catalog today</h2> \n<p>Globally, the awareness and demand for anti-aging skincare products is increasing steadily, and consumers are prioritizing brands that offer multifunctional skincare products to fight signs of aging and enrich the skin. By incorporating these ingredients into your skincare product line, you can ensure you are well placed to benefit from this growing trend.</p> \n"}]}

Here are the bath & body trends that will boost the market between now and 2025.</p> \n<h3>Waterless washing</h3> \n<p>Waterless washing is important for people across the globe for two reasons. UNICEF estimates that3 in 10 people worldwidecannot wash their hands with soap and water in their homes. Secondly, a rise in the cost of living globally has resulted in many people seeking to reduce housing costs; utilities are one cost that people can control.</p> \n<p>Some helpful products includedry shampooandrinse-free soap.</p> \n<p>Bring-your-own-water formatsof bath & body products help reduce fuel emissions and costs during transportation due to lighter weight and less packaging, which can help protect the environment.</p> \n<h3>Intentional bodycare: bath & body for self-care</h3> \n<p>Self-care is the intentional act of protecting one\u2019s own physical and mental well-being.

This results in products that specifically address concerns such as stretch marks and encourage good breast health.</p> \n<p>The skin on the breasts is thinner and more delicate, making it more prone to wrinkle and sagging.

For instance, more and more people like to use fragrances and personal care products to elevate their style and match their makeup and outfit. This has resulted in the expansion of the perfume market.</p> \n<p>In line with the market expansion, more and more customers attach importance to the ingredients of the scent they use. They care about whether the ingredients are safe, sustainable, and individual. This blog offers some insights into this trend.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe overall trend of fragranceIngredient-driven fragrancesConclusion</p> \n<h2>The overall trend of fragrance</h2> \n<p>In recent years, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s perfume markets are growing rapidly in the world.</p> \n<p>The estimatedmarket sizeof global perfume is $31,760 million in 2022 and is predicted to grow to $42,080 million by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period. One of the predicted trends associated with this growth is the rise of an ingredient-drivenperfumeindustry in 2023.</p> \n<p>Many customers care about the chemical elements of a perfume\u2014whether they are beneficial to the health and sustainable. They also pay attention to how each ingredient works with each other to bring out the scent of the perfume.</p> \n<p>In other words, customers attach importance to the physical and sentimental composition of a perfume. They expect the ingredients to be harmless to human health and to bring mental benefits to them. This may be the reason why some customers are willing to buy personalized fragrances.</p> \n<h2>Ingredient-driven fragrances</h2> \n<h3>Focus on wellness</h3> \n<p>When selecting a perfume, customers tend to spend more time checking and comparing the safety and wellness features of the ingredients. McKinsey pointed out that79%of consumers considerwellnessimportant, especially some customers who are cautious of harmful health effects. Consequently, people are sensitive to fragrance chemicals.</p> \n<p>Some perfumes may contain toxic elements, such as allergens, hormone disruptors, and asthma triggers. These elements can also penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. To ensure the safety of your customers, you must be prudent in wholesaling and selling perfume. A logical step is to conduct a safety test or secure a certificate proving that your products meet FDA standards. Instead of products whose labels on the bottles list only water, alcohol, and fragrance, many customers prefer products with labels that can provide a complete list of ingredients.</p> \n<h3>Emphasize sustainability</h3> \n<p>Customers who are aware of their wellness understand the importance of selecting the right ingredient to protect the environment. The most crucial concern about perfumes is their use of petrochemicals, which are biodegradable elements derived from natural gas and petroleum. These chemicals are known as potential contributors to various types of harmful pollution.</p> \n<p>Theperfume\u2002markethas witnessed a rise in the demand for eco-friendly and natural perfumes. To meet customers\u2019 expectations, an increasing number of perfume manufacturers are usingnatural ingredients. In addition, the industry has innovated new synthetic ingredients according to green chemistry principles. In most cases, a new synthetic alternative is more environmentally-friendly than traditional synthetic elements. This innovation prevents the over-farming of crops and avoids the use of wildlife for tests and trials and, therefore, reduces harmful impacts on the environment.</p> \n<p>At present, many people tend to patronizebrandsthat actively take social responsibility toward sustainable development. In this regard, companies that work toward social change and sustainability will attract more buyers.</p> \n<h3>Seek individuality</h3> \n<p>The fragrance is regarded as an indicator of personality. The scent used by a person can convey his or her character.</p> \n<p>Originally, perfume was used to mask body odor. Nowadays, people consider it a method ofself-expression. Customers select the signature scent based on their personal preferences. In this way, rather than choosing a famous fragrance from luxury brands, many people prefer to have a unique niche scent. They would like to build their own fragrance collection, with a day scent that has an attractive top note, joyful middle note, and base note lasting hours.</p> \n<p>Each scent represents apersonality. In the world of fragrance, for example, people who wear floral scents, or light flower scents, are usually friendly, feminine, and enjoy spending time in nature. Fruity lovers are energetic. They tend to like bold and bright colors and can easily attract people. An aquatic smell can activate the image of sea waves, coastlines, sea wind, and rain. This scent is an ideal choice for dreamers who are casual, free-spirited, and simple. Crisp, ripe, and fresh scent links to a sense of chicness and class. Besides that, some people prefer musk, cologne, vanilla, or fruity scent.</p> \n<p>Try to provide customers with a wide array of fragrance notes to allow them to find a scent that complements their characteristics.</p> \n<h3>Offer minimalism</h3> \n<p>Along with Gen Z\u2019s desire to support individuality, the available perfume products in the market are expected to carry a single smell that can be clearly understood and remembered. The current market providescustomizedchoices to allow customers, especially young ones, to design their favorite mixtures, wearing separate or layered fragrances.</p> \n<p>In the US, an ongoing trend of zen and slow living has emerged. Customers who partake in this trend pursue simplicity with a highqualityof ingredients. Hence, these people would be loyal customers of brands that offer simple single-scent perfume. Accordingly, fine fragrance brands have endeavored to use minimal ingredients and produce a unique aroma.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The four trends mentioned above could become the secret to business success. Wholesaling perfume with fewer and harmless ingredients, providing product labels with a comprehensive list of ingredients, and offering buyers customized scents are the leading trends in the 2023 perfume market.

Similarly, halal beauty is a classification of cosmetics that are composed and produced under Islamic law. These products are regulated to be cruelty-free and vegan, that is, they do not use ingredients from pigs, carrion, blood, human body, predatory animals, alcohol, and many others. Some elements from animals are acceptable, however, provided that the animals are appropriately slaughtered following Islamic law. This also requires the manufacturers to maintain purity throughout the process of preparation, processing, and storage of their products.</p> \n<p>In the past, halal products were only popular among Muslim women. But nowadays, these products are more commonly used throughout the world, especially among Millennial vegans and environmentalists. With the market steadily expanding among young customers, the growing popularity has promoted the innovation of these products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe overall market for halal beautyHalal beauty trendsConclusion</p> \n<h2>The overall market for halal beauty</h2> \n<p>A recent report showed that, in 2020, the global halal beauty industry was valued at$29.13billion and is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 20% by the year 2027. Today, online shopping for halal beauty products, including other personal care products, has become a global trend, with the online retail segment expected to grow rapidly in the next 10 years.</p> \n<p>In line with the rise of veganism, more people now have a heightened awareness of environmental issues. This has given way to the rise of the halal beauty industry. More particularly, there are more sustainable choices with only permissible animal ingredients in the production process. Furthermore, younger customers are creative and more interested in buying innovative makeup products. These customers are also digital natives and more likely to be influenced by trends on social media.</p> \n<h2>Halal beauty trends</h2> \n<h3>Expansion of young customers and markets</h3> \n<p>Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have witnessed the rapid growth of halal beauty. The cosmetics market in Southeast Asia is developed in a way that there is great awareness among Muslim consumers and a well-established halal regulatory environment. In 2019, Indonesia passed a law to make halal certification mandatory. As the first country to enforce halal certifications, the regulation is leading the future of halal makeup. At the same time, makeup brands are investing in Malaysia for halal expertise.</p> \n<p>In the APAC region, halal beauty has a highly promising future. There is predicted to have a population of about 1.5 billion Muslims in APAC by 2050. This means that by 2027, APAC is expected to have the largest proportion of the global beauty industry market size in halal cosmetics, reaching $104 billion.</p> \n<p>In addition, Muslim beauty (also known as M-beauty) is capturing global attention and is predicted to be the next big thing after K-beauty. This new trend is led by Millennial Muslim girls and women, who have shown that wearing a hijab can be fashionable. This style is also defined by the makeup that is worn, which is typically characterized by a colorful and elegant style with flawless eyebrows, attracting eye shadows, and bold lips. M-beauty has become an increasingly fashionable trend among young customers within Southeast Asia and worldwide.</p> \n<h3>Health and sustainability of ingredients</h3> \n<p>Although halal beauty was created for the Muslim population, it is also adopted by non-Muslims. Halal cosmetics are produced in a way that ensures the safety and quality of cosmetic ingredients.</p> \n<p>To strictly ensure that halal certification demands are met, an Islamic Affairs organization tracks down the source of every ingredient. A halal certification assures that products are not only safe for the skin, but also the environment.</p> \n<p>Customers regard halal products as harmless and ofhigh quality. Since no alcohol or other non-halal ingredients are used, halal products do not bring adverse effects to the skin. Thus, buyers can feel free to choose from any commodities that have this certification.</p> \n<p>In addition, halal products are made sustainably. Theingredients consist primarily of naturalsources such as vegetables and a few animal sources. Asvegan and cruelty-free cosmeticsare now skyrocketing in demand, many non-Muslims who are looking for eco-friendly and vegan products shift to look forhalal-certified cosmetic products.</p> \n<h3>Innovation in beauty products</h3> \n<p>Another important trend in halal beauty is innovation, as evident from both buyers and sellers. In recent years, a number of trendy and young halal beauty brands have emerged. One of them is BLP Beauty, which offersmakeupin a range of shades that cater to the needs of Indonesian women with different skin tones. Their products are designed and innovated to be comfortable to wear in the hot and humid conditions of Southeast Asia.</p> \n<p>In addition, many halal brands pay close attention to quality. In the past, halal cosmetics performed worse in the market due to their lack of product diversity. But today, consumers can choose from a variety of products, includingwaterproofmakeup in a range of flat andshinycolors.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, innovation in sales channels such ase-commerceis remarkable. These new sales channels are helping companies significantly increase their sales volume. With the growing demand for halal products online, this distribution sales channel is expected to grow at a fast rate of18.2%by 2022. In this case, there is a demand for companies to focus on building their online stores.</p> \n<h3>Marketing with social media</h3> \n<p>To attract younger generations and digital natives, halal beauty brands are emphasizing advertising on social media to stimulate online orders. The new generation of beauty companies is pushing the envelope forward in terms of advertisingcreativityto wow the digitally native population.</p> \n<p>Young Muslim beauty consumers are building their modest fashion empires on the Internet. Social media influencers are sharing beauty tips and their favorite products, which creates a strong bond with followers, not only limited to the Muslim community. With faith and religion being the basis of halal beauty cosmetics, the entire Indonesian color cosmetics market has been boosted.</p> \n<p>As a halal beauty brand, for example, you can participate in online forums to find out what consumers are looking for. To attract more buyers, you can create a website and decorate it to your liking. In addition, you can build publicity events with campaigns on social media. These types of campaigns can be effective in spreading awareness about your brand through word of mouth.</p> \n<p>Promoting halal products with nice packaging, advertising your brand, and hosting related events via social media will help you reach a larger audience and lead the next fashion trend.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>The global halal cosmetics market continues to expand from Southeast Asia to the Middle East, and the global population. To capture more visitors and become a leader in the market, you need to keep up with the latest trends.

As our need to commute diminished and we started being more carefree about our attire and appearance, one would have expected a negative effect on the grooming products market. Multiple studies that indicate strong growth in the grooming items, especially the men\u2019s grooming products, however, proved otherwise. Continue reading to learn about the popularity of grooming products for men, as well as the business prospects that come with it!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe rise of men\u2019s grooming productsTrendy men\u2019s grooming products in 2022Moving forward</p> \n<h2>The rise of men\u2019s grooming products</h2> \n<p>Many indicators point to a steady increase in men\u2019s grooming products for the next 5-10 years. The minimum Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between 2021 and 2026is estimated at 5.1%, while a separate study in 2021 revealed a slightlyhigher CAGR of 6.5% for the forecast period 2022-2027. And an even higher CAGR was predicted to continue for the next ten years,hitting 7.9% from 2021 onwards and reaching around $14.1 billion by 2031.</p> \n<p>Numerous reasons have contributed to this consistent burgeoning trend, from a spike in the number of men\u2019s salons and general disposable income to increased awareness of self-care and the gaining popularity of do-it-yourself (DIY) grooming products. The male grooming products market is set to take off further in the next few years. Among all these reasons, perhaps the most relevant and compelling is the greater focus on personal care in light of the recent global healthcare industry disruption.</p> \n<h2>Trendy men\u2019s grooming products in 2022</h2> \n<h3>Natural/organic ingredients oriented</h3> \n<p>In 2022, when it comes to the selection of grooming products for men, natural or organic-oriented products are without doubt the focus of the year. This statement is self-evident with at least three international US and UK media crowning brands with natural or organic products to top their men\u2019s grooming brands list of the year.</p> \n<p>The top 3 brands that make it into the list of thebest men\u2019s skincare products of 2022 by Observer, for example, are in every aspect natural or organic accentuated. The Los Angeles Magazine went a step further by listing all their top 5 highlighted men\u2019s skincare brands in 2022 as brands with naturally boosted products. In fact, 7 out of its list of top 10 skincare brands for men are natural products. Even half of thelist of new men\u2019s grooming brands to try out in 2022is all about natural elements.</p> \n<p>Forecasts from multiple studies released in 2022 also serve as solid proof of such a growing trend. Natural products for skin are predicted to increase by a CAGR of at least6.6%or up to7.5%between 2022 to 2030. The rise of consumer awareness of health and well-being over the past two years as well as growing environmental concerns are credited as the main driving factors behind such a steady development. All these show that while the costs for natural/ organic grooming products are generally on the high side, people are willing to go for the quality and thereby opening a tremendous opportunity for wholesalers.</p> \n<p>Skincare for men with natural ingredientssuch as aloe vera and shea butter can come in a full set covering from all facial essentials such as face cleanser, face cream, face serum and face masks to hair and body care such as shower gel and shampoo. On top of these, some manufacturers go beyond the typical standard facial and body cleansing products and extend to skincare maintenance series withmoisturizing balm, eye serum, anti-aging facial serum, and night cream. Some of the typical skincare products for men are as illustrated below:</p> \n<h3>Manicure & pedicure</h3> \n<p>Manicure for men has become quite the thing in 2022, led chiefly by various male celebrities, as featured in multiple men\u2019s magazines andfashion websites.</p> \n<p>While men may probably be drawn to nail art for aesthetic reasons, they tend to emphasize self-identity and expressions as well as individuality through it. As demonstrated by most celebrities, men may use nail art as an extension of their complete outfits to magnify their colorful or cool personalities.</p> \n<p>Another practical and pivotal reason that likely ignites such passion is the surge in health consciousness in recent years, which has made people appreciate the necessity of nail care, a role that manicure and pedicure can easily support.</p> \n<p>A complete men\u2019s manicure and pedicure kit typically consists of around15 pieces of professional stainless steel toolsand often includes a few items for facial needs, such as an acne needle or eyebrow scissors. There are also some comprehensive kits such as this29-piece professional manicure pedicure setthat includes tools in various sizes. Alternatively, a rather small, easy-to-carrymanicure pedicure set in a zipper bagwith about 6-8 pieces of essential tools included can also be a great choice for the home use, DIY grooming market.</p> \n<h3>All about beards</h3> \n<p>From anestablished men\u2019s magazineto a popular chain barbershop, beards are unanimously described as an ongoing trend in 2022, even though they were already considered popular back in 2021. They also cited the WFH trend as the likely reason behind the blossoming popularity of beards. While people may not necessarily get more relaxed by working from home, they certainly get more freedom in terms of fashion choices and styling options.</p> \n<p>The good news is, according to multiple reports andstudies, WFH itself is evolving from a trend to be a permanent arrangement in various parts of the world, includingAmericaandAustralia. The liberation endowed by WFH in terms of fashion and grooming taste signifies that the buzz for beards is likely to continue for quite a while.</p> \n<p>Shave care-related products are indeed often inaugurated as thenumber 1 selling product categoryamong all the men\u2019s grooming essentials. This is hardly a surprising fact since almost every man needs to keep a clean-shaven routine from time to time, and this is whena razor with a built-in lubrication stripas shown in the picture below comes in handy.</p> \n<p>And thelatest research, which will be fully released only in July 2022, proves that beard grooming products are definitely on the rise. It reports an increase in personal care products for men and, as a result, a growing trend for beard trimmer-related products.</p> \n<p>Another significant point that underscores the growth of beard care products is the fact that even the world\u2019s top razor brand Gillette began to launch its beard care line of products in 2020. This is indeed a very different move sincea full beard care kitcovers quite a wide range of products, from beard care oil, shampoo, and trimmer to beard roller, basically almost everything a man needs for his beard.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,beard growth or beard length enhancer oilsthat can boost facial hair growth are almost certainly in great demand for those who would like to keep an even, well-groomed beard. Anorganic, herbal-based beard oilmeanwhile may help to elevate the consumer confidence in its health-oriented approach, as shown in the picture here:</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a beard pencil filler may come to the rescue in the event of uneven facial hair growth, which is also known as a patchy beard. Abeard pencilcan help to fill in the gaps between patchy beards and create the impression of a full and groomed beard almost instantly.</p> \n<h2>Moving forward</h2> \n<p>Three major trends in men\u2019s grooming products that wholesalers should keep an eye on in 2022 are natural or organic-oriented products, manicure and pedicure kits, and beard-related items, including shave care and beard care products. In summation, this year\u2019s trends show that men nowadays generally view grooming products as a personal care necessity that should be both healthy and capable of bringing out their personalities while also assisting them in projecting a more manly image. Wholesalers might delve deeper into these aspects to discover more potential in men\u2019s grooming products and get more ideas for similar items fromAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

We\u2019ll analyze the shift in buyer preferences toward ingredients that are natural or organic, eco-friendly, and cruelty-free, emphasizing which trends and products consumers are most looking out for when searching for beauty products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat is sustainable beauty?Global natural and organic beauty marketTop sustainable beauty trends brands should incorporateSustainable beauty is the new beauty standard</p> \n<h2>What is sustainable beauty?</h2> \n<p>We have entered an age in which people around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about the welfare of our planet. Consumers are now considering sustainability, natural origin, product safety, and transparency as key determiners of whether or not they consume certain beauty products.</p> \n<p>Beauty brands the world over have begun developing new formulas that use advanced science to ensure that the natural extracts of beauty product ingredients extend their effects without negatively affecting humans and the environment. This is being called \u201cgreen cosmetics\u201d or \u201cgreen chemistry.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sustainable beauty also extends to the processes associated with getting products from the factories to the consumers, including manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and shipping. Businesses are increasingly seeking out methods that enable them to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations by developing products that use recycled components, reduce waste, and encourage reuse.</p> \n<h2>Global natural and organic beauty market</h2> \n<p>Demand for natural and organic beauty products has been rising rapidly across the globe. The British Beauty Associationreportsthat the global natural beauty products market is projected to reach \u00a317 billion in 2024. It is projected that the market in Asia is particularly meant to grow the fastest, with the Ecovia Intelligence Reportpointing outthat natural beauty sales in Asia increased by 21% in 2017 (the figure for Europe and North America was close to 10%).</p> \n<p>A study conducted by Mintelfoundthat half of U.K. consumers who had purchased beauty products in the year of the study had sought out products that were made with natural ingredients.</p> \n<p>In the U.S.,a third of consumerswho used facial skincare products purchased products that had natural ingredients, and this figure jumped to almost half of consumers when focused on younger consumers aged between 18 and 34. For China, the studyshowed that45% of female consumers who used facial skincare products planned to use products derived from natural ingredients or botanical extracts that improved their skin.</p> \n<h2>Top sustainable beauty trends brands should incorporate</h2> \n<h3>1. Natural and organic ingredients</h3> \n<p>Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward products that includenatural oils(e.g. palm,coconut, argan,avocadooils), agricultural plants (e.g. soybeans, corn, ginseng, goji berries, shiitake mushrooms), and bacteria (e.g. deinococcus bacteria used to create aromatic ingredients and pigments).</p> \n<p>When the chemicals from everyday cosmetics are washed off the skin by users, they do not break down. Instead, they enter the water supplies and the ocean, meaning they can potentially negatively affect both marine and human life.</p> \n<p>The benefit is that natural and organic ingredients are biodegradable, preventing harm to the food chain, environment, oceans, and waterways. In the end, the ingredients are both kind to the user\u2019s skin and the earth. Some great products that use natural ingredients include candles with non-GMO soy wax,biodegradable lipsticks,soap scrubs, andbody balms.</p> \n<h3>2. Upcycled ingredients</h3> \n<p>Another key sustainable beauty trend is eco-friendly upcycled beauty products that use ingredients that would have been discarded as waste. This practice is part of the zero-waste and circular economy movements that seek to use everything as effectively as possible and limit waste to benefit both our planet and our bottom lines.</p> \n<p>Examples of upcycled beauty include the use of coffee grounds, chai spices, and fruit seeds in the formulations of beauty products. The result is products such as coffee oils made from repurposed coffee grounds or products that use recycled water.</p> \n<h3>3. Waterless or solid-liquid products</h3> \n<p>Waterless beauty is one of 2022\u2019s top sustainable beauty trends that use concentrated natural ingredients to create products that do not require water for use. The results are innovative beauty products that significantly reduce water wastage and help keep the environment plastic-free.</p> \n<p>Traditional beauty products are made up of a large amount of water because it is cheap and helps to add bulk to the product, but this results in products that have a large carbon footprint due to the added materials and resources required for packaging and transportation.</p> \n<p>That is why products that use more active ingredients and reduce water usage, such aswaterless shampoos, waterless toothpaste,facial cleansing bars, solid-liquid perfumes, moisturizers, and facial serums are growing in popularity. Users merely need to pour the powders, add water, and this will activate the products.</p> \n<h3>4. Vegan and cruelty-free beauty</h3> \n<p>Part of sustainable beauty is the development and consumption of products that do not cause harm to both humans and the natural environment. The natural environment incorporates both fauna and flora, and animal life.</p> \n<p>Consequently, several brands have altered their product development approaches to ensure that products are safely and effectively assessed without having to be tested on animals. Top personal care brands such as Unilever haveadoptedalternative approaches such as computer modeling and cell culture-based experiments.</p> \n<p>Some consumers are also choosing to buy vegan beauty products because they reduce animal impact by not using animal byproducts in their formulations. Consumers can now purchase products that usevegan pigments, natural vitamins, andplant extractsinstead of animal derivatives.</p> \n<h3>5. Reusable packaging</h3> \n<p>It is not enough for the product alone to be sustainable; sustainable beauty entails that ecological packaging is used for beauty products. This means that there is an effective use of materials when packaging and that the materials used cause minimal harm to the environment.</p> \n<p>As seen in this article onpackaging trends for skin care products, businesses are now incorporating environmentally conscious packaging for their products, including plastic-free packaging.</p> \n<p>In line with circular economy practices, these brands are encouraging consumers to prevent wastage by offering refillable packaging options, such as cosmetics in durableglass containersandaluminum tubes.</p> \n<h3>6. Sustainably sourced, produced, and transported products</h3> \n<p>It has become essential for brands to incorporate sustainability in all stages of their production and supply processes to minimize waste andcarbon emissions. This translates to opting for sustainably sourced native plants and locally sourced ingredients; using renewable energy production, manufacture, and transportation; and aiming for carbon-neutral shipping.</p> \n<p>Brands can adopt sourcing that does deplete the earth but encourage the renewal of material sources. To reduce the carbon footprint of getting products to consumers, brands can also use green logistics strategies by usingeco-friendly packaging, going plastic-free, increasing warehousing efficiency, and optimizing transportation and delivery of products.</p> \n<h3>7. Multipurpose beauty products</h3> \n<p>Avoiding single-use products and materials is a key aspect of the zero-waste movement within clean beauty. Brands are beginning to encourage this by developing multi-use natural products that can be used for multiple purposes.</p> \n<p>Examples of this are all-in-one products such as all-over moisture sticks,oil and serum crossovers,multipurpose body creams, and multipurposebody and facial scrubsthat ensure that consumers reduce waste by not having to buy multiple, independent products for different purposes.</p> \n<h2>Sustainable beauty is the new beauty standard</h2> \n<p>The beauty industry is evolving in the direction of clean and sustainable beauty. To be competitive in the near future, brands must incorporate sustainable beauty trends that align with the shifting preferences and buying patterns of their consumers.</p> \n<p>This would mean adopting eco-friendly ingredients, packaging, sourcing, and production methods that limit harm to human life, animal life, and the environment. In summary, the top sustainable beauty trends beauty brands should be looking to incorporate are:</p> \n"}]}
