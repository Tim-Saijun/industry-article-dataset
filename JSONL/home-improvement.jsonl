In November 2023, this search rate rose to 450,000 \u2013 an increase of 22%.</p> \n<p>In addition, the global drive to save water is helping to push high-tech innovations in the manufacturing of showerheads. This drive extends to the recycling of wastewater and the manufacturing of water-saving devices.</p> \n<p>However, because many different types of showerheads exist, it is vital to understand differences in performance and the conditions in which they excel.</p> \n<h2>How to choose the right showerheads</h2> \n<p>Selecting an appropriate range of showerheads for different customers requires focusing on their features (performance) and design styles.</p> \n<h3>Features to consider when choosing showerheads</h3> \n<p>Five main factors are likely to affect a consumer\u2019s showerhead choices. The main one, as we\u2019ll discuss in further detail below, is their home\u2019s water pressure. Once they know this, they\u2019ll want to consider a showerhead\u2019s flow rate, water-saving features, spray patterns, and materials.</p> \n<p>The best way to determine what water pressure is in the home is to test it with a pressure gauge. The water pressure (force at which the water is ejected out of a pipe) differs from the flow rate (how much water flows out).</p> \n<p>Customers can test the flow rate by timing how long it takes to fill a bucket. This rate is measured by how much water the showerhead receives every minute.</p> \n<p>A medium flow rate of no more than 2.5 GPM (gallons per minute) is mandatory in some countries. But some manufacturers make showerheads that only produce 1.75 GPM and 1.5 GPM, meaning that they save up to 40% water compared to 2.5 GPM products.</p> \n<p>Some modern showerheads have built-in water-saving features. Stocking these products will help your customers meet local regulations and save money. Look for certified water-saving labels to know whether heads feature such technology.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, opting for such innovations does not mean you must sacrifice the quality of your shower time as these features balance water savings and flow rates to ensure a pleasant shower experience.</p> \n<p>Showerhead spray patterns can usually be adjusted to be more gentle or forceful. Knowing the functions of a specific showerhead will help to pick ones that work best in specific conditions.</p> \n<p>Some showerheads can also adjust the flow rate. Overall, it pays to understand how your customers\u2019 purchases will affect their water savings and enjoyment of a good shower.</p> \n<p>Plastic shower heads are typically more cost-effective than stainless steel products but may be more prone to breaking. Retailers should consider stocking a selection of showerhead materials for their particular target markets.</p> \n<h2>An overview of popular showerhead designs</h2> \n<p>Buyers can diversify their showerhead inventories to include different variations in design, budgets, and water pressure.</p> \n<p>Below we\u2019ll take a look at the most popular showerhead styles so that you can stock a range of items that are likely to appease most consumers today.</p> \n<h3>Fixed showerheads</h3> \n<p>Fixed showerheads, as the name suggests, are fixed to the wall at a certain height. The angle of the head can be adjusted, but the flow rate is only adjustable via the faucet.</p> \n<p>While being economical, fixed showerheads are less versatile than other types of showerhead. However, because they are basic and affordable benefit, they may be more suitable for entry-level or cash-strapped homeowners.</p> \n<h3>Rain showerheads</h3> \n<p>Rainfall showerheads are ideal for high-end luxury markets. They are made from various materials, come in a wide water distribution patterns, and often boast multiple functions. Customers can mount them on the wall or ceiling.</p> \n<p>Because of their design, some rainfall showerheads feature water pressure up to 1.5 times stronger than regular showerheads. They can also help to save up to 36,000 liters (7919 gallons) of water annually.</p> \n<h3>Dual showerheads</h3> \n<p>Made for the medium to high-end market, dual shower heads offer a different experience to the options above in that they can be used separately or together for a focused spray and a gentle rinse.</p> \n<p>Some designs also come with up to 10 spray patterns, including\u00a0 a rotation mode and a rain pattern spray.</p> \n<h3>Handheld showerheads</h3> \n<p>Handheld showerheads sit in a cradle fixed to the wall and the fwater flows from the mains via a connecting hose. Users simply remove the showerhead when needed and adjust the water level.

This allows customers to envision your products in their workspaces.</p> \n<h3>Idea 4: Stay tech-savvy for efficiency</h3> \n<p>It\u2019s 2024, and technology is crucial in creating a productive and modern home office environment. Most remote employees seek home office furniture and equipment that integrate technology for better connectivity and productivity.</p> \n<p>For instance, office furniture and accessories with built-in cable management can help maintain a clean and organized workspace. Wireless devices (charging pads, Bluetooth-enabled peripherals, and wireless routers) can reduce the reliance on wired connections and clutter.</p> \n<p>Other tech-friendly home office design ideas include desks with built-in USB ports, ergonomic chairs with integrated device holders, and adjustable lighting with color temperature control.</p> \n<h3>Idea 5: Consider ergonomics for productivity and comfort</h3> \n<p>Working from home can involve sitting for long hours, and for employees to increase productivity, they\u2019ll need comfort. The proper ergonomic setup can make a world of difference in how efficiently individuals work from home.</p> \n<p>Companies invest inergonomic home office chairswith proper lumbar support, adjustable desks that cater to standing or sitting positions, and accessories like monitor stands for comfort.</p> \n<p>Adjustable chairs and desks allow users to find the optimal height and angle, thus reducing strain on the neck, back, and wrists.</p> \n<h3>Idea 6: Consider sustainability for environmental-friendliness</h3> \n<p>In the rapidly growing work-from-home environment, sustainability is a significant factor for individual and business brands.</p> \n<p>And for online retail store owners selling modern office furniture and equipment, embracing sustainable practices and offering eco-friendly products is essential to cater to the growing demand for environmentally conscious solutions.</p> \n<p>For example, stores with furniture made from recycled or upcycled materials, sustainable woods, and low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) finishes resonate well with eco-conscious customers.</p> \n<p>Environmental-conscious employees will likely prefer products certified by recognized sustainability organizations or standards, such asFSC(Forest Stewardship Council) for wood products orGREENGUARDfor low-emission furniture.</p> \n<p>Another environmentally friendly tip is biophilic design, where one invites nature into the home office space. Indoor plants are excellent additions to the working area. Alternatively, one can set up an office near a window facing a garden courtyard or other natural landscape for a better view.</p> \n<h3>Idea 7: Choose multi-sensory experience for unforgettable workdays</h3> \n<p>The ideal modern office design engages multiple senses. They incorporate a multi-sensory approach, turning a home office into a breathtaking workspace.</p> \n<p>Some businesses includearomatherapy diffusersfor invigorating scents that boost focus and creativity.</p> \n<p>And what about walls that change color according to an employee\u2019s mood or task? Smart homes can offer walls that offer a visually stimulating experience.</p> \n<p>Innovative furniture and multi-sensory office designs can create a workspace that tantalizes one\u2019s senses. This creativity will turn every workday into an unforgettable journey of productivity and enjoyment.</p> \n<h2>Transform workspaces into productivity havens</h2> \n<p>Remote work is on the rise without signs of slowing down anytime soon. This means that the demand for office furniture and equipment will remain high.</p> \n<p>However, companies and businesses prioritize comfortable and functional products for their employees to improve productivity. And that\u2019s where unconventional modern office designs come in.</p> \n<p>A trader in this space should find unique selling points that customers identify with. While functionality is essential, aesthetics are also valuable for home office spaces.</p> \n<p>Remember, customers aren\u2019t just buying furniture or equipment; they\u2019re investing in their productivity, well-being, and creativity. So, every item they buy has the potential to influence how they approach their workday.</p> \n<p>And in this modern age, where customization and personalization are prized, retailers can guide them on a journey of self-discovery through design.</p> \n"}]}

But with this approach, the team can turn those empty walls staring back at them into a secret weapon!</p> \n<p>Vertical storage allows organizations to create a multi-tier wall-mounted home office to maximize space at their employees\u2019 homes. For example,wall-mounted desksthat fold away when not in use make it possible to design an office without clutter.</p> \n<p>They can createfloating shelveson the wall for storing office supplies, helping them stay organized and professional.</p> \n<p>But ensure the office is in a well-lit area or establish it near a window to benefit from the natural light.</p> \n<p>Want to know more? Check out thesehome office desk trendsto help you utilize vertical walls at home.</p> \n<h3>2. The transformed closet shelf</h3> \n<p>Use the bottom shelf as a desk and the upper shelves to store supplies.</p> \n<p>However, before jumping in with this idea, ensure the closet is deep enough to function as an office space. If a space isn\u2019t large enough, remodel it. Remove the lower shelves and install the desk high to slide the printer, scanner, and file cabinets underneath.</p> \n<p>Paint the closet with refreshing colors and addsimple office lightingto brighten the space.</p> \n<p>And since the space is limited, use anarmless chairthat can slide under the desk. You can create more space by replacing closet doors withsimple room divider curtains.</p> \n<h3>3. The convertible nook</h3> \n<p>Still dissatisfied? What about a multifunctional and convertible workspace?</p> \n<p>We\u2019re talking about furniture that\u2019s as versatile as a chameleon.</p> \n<p>Many corporations have invested in this approach, allowing their employees to transform guest rooms into functional home offices during the day. For example, the Murphy can magically become a home office workstation.</p> \n<p>This convertible desk bed can turn any bedroom into a highly functional office. It has a large desk space to keep office machines and supplies. Interestingly, the Murphy bed can unlock without affecting the office equipment sitting on the desktop.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, therotating Murphy bedwith a multifunctional wardrobe is also perfect for small spaces.</p> \n<p>Other highly demanded convertible space-saving and multifunction furniture for small office spaces include foldable flip-top training tables and wall-mounted floating desks.</p> \n<h3>4. The stand workstation</h3> \n<p>Adjustable lift office desks are ideal for companies or businesses with employees whose work involves standing. These desks occupy less space, and the team can leverage them as a presentation podium to pitch ideas to prospects via video calls.</p> \n<p>For example, the adjustablesit-and-stand deskallows executives to work from their bedroom, living room, or patio. With this workstation, they can tilt the desktop at will or adjust its height to suit theirergonomic office chair.</p> \n<h3>5. The mirror illusion</h3> \n<p>Who says employees need an extra home office space as a workstation? Mirrors are here to save the day. They create an illusion of more space and light, making a tiny office look like a grand ballroom.</p> \n<p>Okay, maybe not that big, but you get the point. Strategically placed mirrors will have the office feel surprisingly spacious and brighter.</p> \n<p>For instance, placing mirrors opposite windows or on cabinet doors can make a small office space appear large.</p> \n<h3>6. The nomadic office</h3> \n<p>Companies want their workers to perform at their best. This may be hindered by the fact that small home offices lead employees to spend hours staring at the same four walls, which can stifle productivity.</p> \n<p>The solution?</p> \n<p>Mobile office spaces. This home office idea for small spaces allows employees to roll their compact desk to the window and bask in the sunlight. It\u2019s like a mini-vacation for their mind.</p> \n<p>With asoundproof portable home office, workers can set up anywhere around the house or take things outdoors for a change in scenery to boost creativity.</p> \n<p>We recommend investing in a compact rolling desk or a foldable workspace with built-in storage for easy mobility.</p> \n<h3>7. The zen zone</h3> \n<p>Running a business from a home office can mean working long hours, hence the need for a chill-out zone.</p> \n<p>Life isn\u2019t all about work, it\u2019s about finding the right balance. And adding a cozy corner with around Papasan chair, soft lighting, and a calming painting may be just what one needs. One can also add personal pictures, quotes, or small inspirational objects.</p> \n<p>A few minutes of zen coupled with meditation, stretching, or deep breathing can supercharge one\u2019s batteries, especially when the day\u2019s stress is weighing one down.</p> \n<p>Taking a breather in the zen corner, in this case, can be like a mini spa retreat.</p> \n<h2>The bottom line</h2> \n<p>Home office furniture is a growing market with many organizations investing in their employees, helping them to create comfortable spaces to work in at home.\u00a0With the rise in these spaces becoming the norm globally, retailers can cater to this trend by supplying their buyers with the kinds of productivity-boosting items they demand.

The surging demand forLED lightingis due to favorable government initiatives that encourage the replacement of incandescent lights with LED to support environmental sustainability.</p> \n<h2>Indoor lighting trends in 2024</h2> \n<h3>Industrial lighting</h3> \n<p>Country and farmhouse light fixtures with fabric lampshades or coverings are no longer trendy as industrial lighting takes over in 2024.Industrial lightingis a design trend that references the simple and sturdy aesthetic of factories and industrial spaces.</p> \n<p>Industrial light fixturesare void of embellishment and are intended to be more functional than decorative. However, combined with modern interiors or contrasted against antique furniture, industrial lamps and lights can be transformed into stylish interior accessories.</p> \n<p>Industrial lightsare made of robust and easy to clean materials like steel and aluminum. They generally come in the color of natural unfinished metal, such as black, gold, silver, copper, or bronze. Industrial lamps can also feature details like exposed light bulbs, anchor chains, heavy duty links, chainmail metal weaves, or caged designs.</p> \n<h3>Black accents</h3> \n<p>Black lights are a trend that can be incorporated into any interior design style. The striking look of a saturated black light exudes elegance and is commonly used to accent rooms with neutral color schemes.</p> \n<p>A variety ofblack light fixturescan add depth to a space, including floor lamps,table lamps, chandeliers, or wall sconces. They are often constructed from black metal and can be complemented with touches of brass, rose gold, or silver along the fixture or inside the lamp for an elevated appearance.</p> \n<p>Black indoor lightscan be given extra style with interesting textures or unexpected shapes. Ablack rattan lightoffers a sophisticated bohemian look, while structures that involve curves, linear lines, or geometric angles will satisfy any contemporary interior.</p> \n<h3>Architectural forms</h3> \n<p>A bold and eye-catching design is expected to be popular for lighting in 2024. Lamps and lights with architectural forms will be used like sculptures or decorative art in a room.</p> \n<p>Architectural chandeliersor pendant lights with dynamic shapes featuring curves, rings, globes, circles, ovals, or rounded pieces will be ideal for creating comfortable and cozy interiors. Additionally, there will be an excitement around unusual shapes and a strong art deco influence with geometric shapes and angular forms.</p> \n<p>Architectural lightsare commonly made from matte or glossy molded metal for a minimalist aesthetic. An interest in large scalearchitectural light fixturesis also expected to reign this year but businesses are advised to take advantage of the trend before it passes.</p> \n<h3>Linear light fixtures</h3> \n<p>Another lighting trend this year islinear light fixtures. A linear lighting fixture is a light designed in a straight continuous or broken line. Linear lighting can feature a series of suspended pendant lamps or LED strips applied along the length of the fixture. Alternatively, elongated lights can also be decorated with curvy lines and free flowing configurations to add drama to the space.</p> \n<p>Linear lightsare ideal as light sources for large rooms, corridors, or above a long table, such as a kitchen island, dining room table, home office desk, or boardroom table.Linear lightingis often hung from the ceiling, although this type of lighting can also be installed as a vanity light in a bathroom or as strips along the floor in hallways, next to the steps on a staircase, or even under the headboard of a bed for a futuristic atmosphere.</p> \n<h3>Spot lighting</h3> \n<p>In 2024,spot lightingwill begin to replace traditional chandeliers and ceiling lights. Spotlights feature a narrow beam of directional light and can be mounted to either a ceiling or wall. This type of light is suitable for modern interior design because of its industrial appeal.</p> \n<p>Spot light fixturesoffer plenty of light without taking up too much space, making them ideal for areas like the kitchen, living room, or focal point of a room. Customers with studios, low ceilings, or atypical layouts may also be interested in the simplicity and versatility of spot lighting.</p> \n<p>Indoor spot lightscan also feature adjustable 360 degree directional lamps for more control over where the light is directed. The lamps can even be affixed to a track for flexibility in rooms that are larger and require more lighting.</p> \n<h2>Staying on top of light fixture trends</h2> \n<p>The trends in the indoor lighting market for 2024 shine a light on architectural form and practical design. Industrial light fixtures dominate the market with their quality construction and unfinished appeal. For customers interested in more decorative pieces, architectural light fixtures and linear lights use size and shape to make a big statement. Finally, spot lighting gives customers flexibility in rooms with angular ceilings, while black light fixtures add a sleek and sophisticated accent to any room.</p> \n<p>There is a need for indoor lighting among both residential and commercial customers. As a result, there is significant opportunity in the market for businesses to take advantage of. With a positive outlook on future industry growth, businesses should stay ahead of competitors by offering trendy lights in the upcoming year.</p> \n"}]}

It is incredibly durable, with most people using the peel to bind furniture.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, wicker has nothing to do with materials. Instead, it\u2019s a manufacturing technique for making furniture from straw, willow, bamboo, and rattan. This technique requires wetting the materials before weaving them into the desired shape.</p> \n<p>So while rattan is a product, wicker is a furniture-making technique.

The color can fade over time whether consumers place them indoors or outdoors.</p> \n<p>Hence, retailers must ensure their products offer adequate UV protection, allowing consumers to enjoy the vibrant colors for longer. UV protection also safeguards the material against splitting in the heat.</p> \n<h3>Are the cushions comfortable?</h3> \n<p>Consumers will spend a lot of time on their rattan garden set, meaning the padded cushion on each seat should offer long-term comfort\u2014while maintaining shape. For optimal consistency, businesses can opt for olefin and acrylic cushion fabrics. These options also have high fade resistance and durability,</p> \n<p>Cushions should also have foam fillings to provide lasting comfort and aesthetic appeal, even after prolonged use.</p> \n<h3>Weatherproofing is a must!</h3> \n<p>No doubt, rattan furniture will remain exposed to unpredictable weather all year round. For this reason, it must withstand various conditions without taking damage.</p> \n<p>Naturally, rattan originates from rainforests, making it suitable for outdoor purposes. Rattan furniture has inherent waterproof properties, allowing them to endure even the harshest weather when consumers leave them outdoors.</p> \n<h2>Go get these rattan garden sets</h2> \n<p>As 2024 pushes forward, rattan garden sets continue reigning as timeless and stylish choices for outdoor living. With their versatility, durability, and natural charm, these sets can effortlessly elevate any garden or patio space.</p> \n<p>Rattan furniture offers various options for different styles, whether consumers prefer sleek modern designs or cozy rustic aesthetics.

It is recommended to choosewaterproof and dustproof wallpapers, as they can be easily wiped clean without damaging the wallpaper. It is also essential to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials when cleaning 3D wallpapers, as they can damage the wallpaper\u2019s surface.</p> \n<h2>The bottom line</h2> \n<p>3D wallpapers are an excellent way to add depth, texture, and visual interest to any room.

One can manually and individually adjust the grille\u2019s two sets of parallel blades (horizontal and vertical) to regulate air volume entering the room.</p> \n<p>These types of grilles allow one to achieve a different airflow direction depending on the degree of the blades.</p> \n<p>You can install them on wall and floor dividers, allowing both rooms to share a single air conditioning system.</p> \n<p>Custom-made grilles made of wood composites can help in decorating different living spaces. One can choose the ones with a rainbow of stock finishes or custom colors. These pieces of artwork are perfect for window design, walls, ceilings, and transoms.</p> \n<p>Custom-made filter grilles can also serve as wallpapers, providing a glamorous custom design and beautiful aesthetics.</p> \n<h3>Diffusers</h3> \n<p>Diffusers are different from grilles because they allow you to adjust the amount of air that passes through them. These ventilators are also fitted with dampers to distribute air around the room.</p> \n<p>And since they are designed to distribute the air in all directions, they are often installed in the ceiling. Engineers use them to cover an air-con or air-release outlet.</p> \n<p>One can choose different shapes and sizes depending on the shape and size of the vent. For instance, the4-way square air diffuserhas an adjustable plastic handle to help control the wind\u2019s volume.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, one can settle for unique diffuser designs likeeyeball diffusers. These diffusers have a sphere within a holder, which you can roll to focus in any desired direction.</p> \n<p>Generally, diffusers are the ideal HVAC system ventilators in hotels and rooms requiring uniform air distribution. But the airflow path and pattern depend on the damper of the diffusers.</p> \n<p>Decorative diffusers with unique designs that match a room\u2019s d\u00e9cor can contribute to its aesthetic appeal. Luxury hotels, villas, and palaces can utilize decorative diffusers to enhance the building\u2019s architectural beauty and themes.</p> \n<h3>Registers</h3> \n<p>Air registers are similar to grilles but come with adjustable dampers like diffusers. The dampers allow the user to control the air in the indoor spaces through the vent.</p> \n<p>However, they differ from diffusers in that they only allow single-direction airflow. They are commonly found in public places like grocery stores, villas, and hotels, allowing air into the rooms in a fixed direction through floor vents.</p> \n<p>A good example is theair floor register vent cover, available in black or white color. These neutral colors make it compatible with surface floor materials such as drywall, hardwood, vinyl, carpet, and laminate.</p> \n<h2>How to choose air grilles, registers, and diffusers</h2> \n<p>Choosing the right ventilation product is challenging without the right information. Here is what you should consider to make better choices.</p> \n<h3>Material</h3> \n<p>Air grilles, registers, and diffusers are made from aluminum, steel, and plastic materials. Each material has its benefits and drawbacks.</p> \n<p>For example, while aluminum and steel are durable and strong, they are expensive. In contrast, plastic may be less durable, but it is affordable.</p> \n<p>Other factors that determine which material to go for include:</p> \n<p>\u2013 Functionality: The material of the air grille, register, or diffuser should handle the required air flow rate, withstand pressure differences, and provide the necessary acoustic performance.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Environment: Factors such as temperature, humidity, exposure to chemicals, and other environmental conditions may affect the performance and durability of the product. Aluminum is a popular choice for air grilles, registers, and diffusers because it is corrosion-resistant and can withstand exposure to moisture.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Aesthetics: Stainless steel diffusers, registers, and grilles can provide a sleek and modern look, while plastic offers various colors to suit the space\u2019s d\u00e9cor.</p> \n<h3>Size and height of the space</h3> \n<p>The size and height of the indoor space are valuable factors when selecting diffusers, grilles, and registers.</p> \n<p>Large spaces with high ceilings require diffusers and grilles with high airflow rates to distribute air evenly throughout the room.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, smaller spaces with lower ceilings may need diffusers and grilles with lower airflow rates to avoid creating drafts or hot spots.</p> \n<p>Large spaces also require linear diffusers to distribute air over a larger area. In contrast, a smaller, enclosed space may require circular diffusers that can distribute the air in a more targeted manner.</p> \n<p>Consult a professional HVAC contractor or engineer to know the ideal diffusers and grilles for your space.</p> \n<h3>Air delivery requirements</h3> \n<p>The airflow rate is the amount of air that can pass through the grille, register, or diffuser. One should choose a product with an airflow rate suitable to their application.</p> \n<p>Factors to consider when calculating airflow requirements include:</p> \n<p>\u2013 Size of the room</p> \n<p>\u2013 The number of occupants</p> \n<p>\u2013 Heat-generating equipment and appliances</p> \n<h3>Sound levels</h3> \n<p>Noise levels determine the HVAC system a property manager chooses. One can select the return and exhaust inlets according to maximum face velocity.</p> \n<p>For instance, hotel rooms, residences, and theaters may require quiet applications with a face velocity ranging from 250 to 2,500 fpm.</p> \n<p>However, process exhausts may function well with a noisy HVAC system. Manufacturers can consider neck velocity and catalog NC ratings when selecting supply air outlets.</p> \n<p>A neck velocity below 500 fpm is ideal for quiet operations.</p> \n<h3>Maintenance</h3> \n<p>Choosing products that require minimal maintenance and are easy to clean prevents air quality issues and ensures optimal performance. Some products are easy to remove for cleaning, while some require more extensive maintenance.</p> \n<h3>Type</h3> \n<p>The air grille, register, or diffuser one chooses depends on where you plan to install it.</p> \n<p>For instance, ceiling diffusers are often suspended ceilings, sidewall registers fit on the walls, and floor grilles are installed on floors.</p> \n<p>However, some products also suit multiple locations, so choose the appropriate product specific to the application.</p> \n<h2>Choosing ideal grilles, registers, and diffusers</h2> \n<p>Good ventilation is crucial for air quality and comfort in any indoor space. The traditional HVAC systems can create a stuffy and polluted environment, which is why grilles, registers, and diffusers are important.</p> \n<p>These components help to balance the energy efficiency of HVAC systems with cleaner and fresher air.

What\u2019s worse, imagine bathing on a cold morning and using a damp, smelly towel. Even thinking about it may send shivers down your spine. But this can be avoided thanks to the Swedish company Toomec AB, who developed the idea of towel warmers in the 1980s. Towel warmers were first presented as a quality of luxury hotels in Europe only, but today are a widely demanded product by consumers. This article will explain the key factors to consider when sourcing towel warmers.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsFactors that drive the market growth of towel warmersA buying guide for towel warmersMaterials of towel warmersTypes of towel warmersConsiderations before buying a towel warmerProspective clients of towel warmersConclusion</p> \n<h2>Factors that drive the market growth of towel warmers</h2> \n<p>The growth of the towel warmer market is expected to reach$ US 1,731.60 millionby 2028. Urbanization is a high factor in increasing the demand for towel warmers worldwide. Consumers\u2019 preference for a modern-day apartment with the mandatory standard fixture of towel warmers in thelatest bathroomshas significantly increased the demand for towel warmers worldwide.</p> \n<p>Among other things, increasing comfort and energy efficiency, reducing laundry, streamlining storage options, eliminating bacteria, technological advancements, and bathroom improvements, along with millennials buying home automation and using spas, have increased the demand for towel warmers.</p> \n<p>Because of the region\u2019s requirement for effective energy solutions and the need for heating equipment in restrooms due to the region\u2019s harsh weather, Europe dominates the towel warmers industry. A high growth rate is anticipated in Asia-Pacific from 2021 to 2028 due to the region\u2019s expanding residential and commercial construction industries. Between 2022 and 2027, the market for towel warmers is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of5.8%.</p> \n<h2>A buying guide for towel warmers</h2> \n<p>Other growth-promoting elements in towel warmers include a variety of product developments, such as the introduction of programmable, Wi-Fi-enabledtowel warmersthat can be turned on or off following user demand. Product producers create long-lasting, energy-efficient variations using recyclable, corrosion-resistant, and high-grade stainless steel. It is projected that further factors, such as increased consumer spending power and active marketing campaigns by product producers through online retail platforms, will propel the market even further.</p> \n<h2>Materials of towel warmers</h2> \n<p>There are three commonly used towel warmer materials.</p> \n<h3>Stainless steel towel warmers</h3> \n<p>Stainless steel combines three materials, i.e., steel, chromium, and nickel. It\u2019s easy to clean as it is typically stain-proof. It\u2019s perfect for washrooms where the environment is moist as its corrosion, tarnish, and scratch-free without any known health risks. It\u2019s an extremely demanded, hygienic, yet expensive material for towel warmers.</p> \n<h3>Copper</h3> \n<p>Copper is stable with a high weight and density. It retains its shape and color even after electroplating and polishing. An increase in the price of copper has infiltrated the price of copper towel warmers, which has decreased its demand over time.</p> \n<h3>Aluminum towel warmers</h3> \n<p>Aluminum towel warmers are the best for their qualities like anti-corrosion, durability, chic style, efficient heat output, and energy. The heat output ratio between steel and aluminum is 1:2, which means one rod of heated stainless steel equals two heated aluminum rods. However, aluminum towel warmers heat faster due to their delicate and less sturdy bodies. Aluminum towel warmers are environmentally and pocket friendly, saving you from high utility bills.</p> \n<h2>Types of towel warmers</h2> \n<p>Depending on the type of installation, there are two main types of towel warmers.</p> \n<h3>Electric</h3> \n<p>You can use an electric towel warmer rack if you don\u2019t want a permanent installation. It heats by using electricity, which is equivalent to approximately two bulbs. It needs a power outlay to function correctly. It\u2019s best to be used with a freestanding model.</p> \n<h3>Hydronic</h3> \n<p>Like a radiator, a hydronic towel warmer uses hot water to provide heat. The water gets heated either with existing hot water or water running through the rails of the towel warmer to offer energy-efficient heat. Some hydronic towel warmers are water-filled towel warmers that combine water with glycol to keep the bars warm and stop corrosion and rust.</p> \n<h2>Considerations before buying a towel warmer</h2> \n<p>The following factors should be considered before buying a towel warmer.</p> \n<h3>Price range</h3> \n<p>Towel warmers are available in varied ranges i.e. as low as under $ US 300 to as high as $ US 4,000. The price range of towel warmers varies as per their size, design, and installation. A towel warmer with a sleek modern design would be expensive, requiring additional units for professional installation. At the same time, a standard installation with a simple minimalist style tends to come at a lower price tag.</p> \n<h3>Design</h3> \n<p>Towel warmers are available in various designs and colors, from contemporary to classic. They\u2019re also available in multiple finishings like antique gold, oil-rubbed bronze, satin nickel, polished bronze, andstainless steel. Also, some towel warmers have bonus features like a hook for hanging robes,extra heating, and extra storage capacity.</p> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>Towel warmers are available in various sizes, from large to small units. Towel warmers with a greater surface area can warm and dry multiple towels simultaneously. But remember, a larger unit requires a larger washroom.</p> \n<h3>Installation and location</h3> \n<p>Most towel warmers are easy to install. They require a 12 V plug into any outlet, just like everyday appliances. At the same time, some towel warmers require professional installation. Their installation also depends upon the mounting position. Generally, an electric free-standing towel warmer is the easiest to operate and can be installed by anyone. But a free-standing towel warmer isn\u2019t safe in the presence of kids; thus, wall-mountedtowel warmersmay be a better option, but they require the help of a professional, which adds cost for the consumer.</p> \n<h3>Switchers and timers</h3> \n<p>The most efficient way to use a towel warmer is to keep it on as the energy used initially by a towel warmer to keep it heated is more than the energy it needs to keep it warm once heated. Many towel warmers offer switches, timers, and thermostats for the user\u2019s convenience.</p> \n<h2>Prospective clients of towel warmers</h2> \n<p>Regarding market share in 2019, the commercial sector dominated the use of towel warmers, accounting for69.4%of all applications. The expanding commercial sector and flourishing tourism drive higher demand in the retail industry. Towel warmers are lightweight, simple to use, durable, and highly demanded by industry business owners. Due to their low cost and ease of installation, owners are likelier to choose electric towel warmers.</p> \n<p>Further, colder weather in Europe and people\u2019s awareness about germs and personal hygiene have drastically increased the demand for towel warmers among the general population.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Besides heating and drying towels, towel warmers reduce the danger of contamination and diseases from moist towels by removing coliform bacteria, mold, and mildew spores. Homeowners tend to care a lot about thelook of their bathrooms; the best towel warmer suits people\u2019s budgets, bathroom designs, and space. After assessing your market\u2019s budget and needs, you can efficiently stock the best models oftowel warmersby reviewing a wide selection of towel warmers onAlibaba.com.</p> \n"}]}

The market\u2019s leading players are IKEA, Steelcase, Williams Sonoma, West Elm, and USM Modular Furniture.</p> \n<h3>What is modular furniture?</h3> \n<p>As we all know, the furniture requirements of an office vary depending on the industry, location, and employee preferences. Although a wide range of furniture is available on the market, it may not meet all the needs at once. While they can be efficient and have desirable characteristics, they may not be appropriate for all types of work. In such situations, modular furniture comes in handy.</p> \n<p>Modularfurnitureis a collection of items that can be customized to meet individual requirements. It is gaining popularity as a result of its numerous benefits. Modular furniture can be easily assembled and disassembled, allowing for the creation of flexible workspaces. Additionally, it offers the choice of replacing components without having to purchase new furniture, saving money on additional expenses.</p> \n<h2>Buying guide for modular furniture</h2> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>The budget is one of the most important factors to consider when making a purchase. While keeping costs within the budget is essential, spending on furniture should be considered an investment. Thus, it makes sense to prioritizequalityover quantity.</p> \n<h3>Functionality</h3> \n<p>Modular furniture is ideal for workplaces because it can be customized to any size or specification. Even on a tight budget, one can select a specific design that fits the budget because modularfurnituremanufacturers provide diverse options; some even allow customers to customize the product by allowing them to select the desired raw material.</p> \n<h3>Customizability</h3> \n<p>It is a good idea to check with the supplier to see if the furniture can be customized to meet one\u2019s technological and functional requirements. For instance, having additional spaces in the desk for charging cables to go through and reach the socket. Moreover, getting the desk customized as per the size requirements and the option to add cabinets to store items.</p> \n<p>One can also get different types offurniturecombined into a single furniture set. Check whether the supplier allows shoppers to adjust the number of chairs, tables, or couches along with the desks. And also the options on offer related to choosing the color and design.</p> \n<h3>Flexibility</h3> \n<p>One of the reasons modular furniture has grown in popularity in recent years is that it is multifunctional, eliminating the need for multiple items. Mostmodulardesks include a large storage area for files or cabinets for additional storage space. However, storage may only be necessary for some, so it is important to consider how the office will be used.</p> \n<h3>Replaceability</h3> \n<p>It is worth considering what comes next after buying a product. Good manufacturers provide replacement parts and delivery services. This is an important consideration because, if used improperly, some parts can become broken or damaged, necessitating a replacement. So suppliers who provide good after-sales support are worth investigating so that users can get replacement parts quickly.</p> \n<h3>Easily adjustable</h3> \n<p>When purchasing office furniture, it is important to consider whether the table can be easily adjusted to suit the preferences of different individuals. Additionally, one must confirm that the furniture can occasionally be moved around to suit the situation.</p> \n<p>One significant advantage ofmodularfurniture is that it helps save floor space. Some tables, for example, can be nested against the wall when not in use, freeing up space for other purposes. It\u2019s worth considering whether the furniture can be easily rearranged, moved to a different location for the user\u2019s convenience, and then easily returned to its original position.</p> \n<h3>Cost-effective</h3> \n<p>As more people become aware of climate change and its consequences, sustainable furniture is gaining popularity. Switching to low-cost, sustainable furniture is prudent because it will benefit you in the long run.Modularfurniture is the ideal solution because it is easy to assemble and requires less effort, resulting in lower labor costs.</p> \n<p>Modular furniture is available at various price points, with the option of upgrading them based on the customer\u2019s needs. Reading product reviews online to determine which brand provides the best quality is wise.</p> \n<h3>Details to consider when selecting an office desk</h3> \n<p>To maximize efficiency, one should think about the floor plan and the daily operations in the office. For instance, L-shaped and U-shaped desks are perfect for smaller spaces because they take up less surface area. Furthermore, tables with built-in lockable drawers are great in offices where employees are out of the office most of the time for added security and privacy.</p> \n<p>In terms of desk shape, a modular desk is a good choice in offices where team members frequently collaborate because the design allows for greater interaction. If storage is a top priority, then desks with an overhead storage hutch are ideal for maximizing space while catering to the storage requirements. A corner or computer desk with pull-out drawers works well in offices with limited space.</p> \n<h2>Other factors to consider</h2> \n<p>Office chairs:It goes without saying that an office chair is necessary for the workplace. Go for chairs with features like lumbar backrest support and armrests that provide maximum comfort.</p> \n<p>Furniture series: depending on the brand, many desks are part of afurnitureseries that includes other useful components such as bookcases and lateral files. So it\u2019s worth looking through the entire office desk furniture series to find items that match in design and aesthetics.</p> \n<p>Durability and finish: Furniture with laminated surfaces comes in various styles and finishes and is much more durable. Additionally, wood veneer surfaces with lacquer finishes are also great options. They are not only durable but also provide a sophisticated appearance.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Office workstations have evolved to match changing consumer demands.

The market now plays host to a variety of traditional and modern shampoo chairs and this buying guide will take an in depth look into the key features of some of these chairs as well as what to consider before purchasing a shampoo chair.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThings to consider when purchasing a shampoo chairGlobal market value of shampoo chairsPopular types of shampoo chairsSummary</p> \n<h2>Things to consider when purchasing a shampoo chair</h2> \n<p>Shampoo chairs are different from barber and hairstyling chairs. This type of chair is used during the washing and conditioning stage of the client\u2019s hair treatment and includes different features which aren\u2019t needed in other types of salon chairs. There are some important considerations to take into account before purchasing a salon chair that every salon owner will look at.</p> \n<h3>Comfort</h3> \n<p>Having a shampoo chair that\u2019s comfortable for the client should be one of the first things to take into consideration. Clients will want to feel relaxed while having their hair washed and treated, and the shampoo station is considered to be the most relaxing part of a visit to the salon for many customers. The chair should recline in a way that doesn\u2019t create back or neck pain for the client and makes it comfortable for them to rest their neck on the basin.</p> \n<h3>Maintenance</h3> \n<p>Buying even one shampoo chair can be a big investment as the chair will be used time and time again by clients. Maintenance is key for this type of salon chair, so taking into account the material so that it\u2019s easy to clean after each use is essential. Shampoo chairs are usually made of a high-quality material that is easy to wipe and disinfect and won\u2019t become damaged if water is splashed onto them.</p> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>No two shampoo chairs are made the same. While some may have the most basic features built into them, others are very high-end and built for expensive hair salons who cater to an exclusive list of clientele. Choosing a shampoo chair that fits within the buyers\u2019 budget is important as not all high-end features are necessary, especially if the chairs are being purchased for a smaller salon. For example, hair schools will most likely purchase very basic shampoo chairs for their students to practice with.</p> \n<h3>Style</h3> \n<p>Having a shampoo chair that fits in with the overall style and theme of a salon is something that may be overlooked in favor of other factors such as budget or functionality, but it\u2019s still something that can be crucial to the success of a business. Shampoo chairs and backwash units need to seamlessly flow with the rest of the salon, and there are a lot of styles and colors to choose from today.</p> \n<h3>Purpose</h3> \n<p>Buyers should think about why they are purchasing a shampoo chair, or multiple chairs. The amount of space within the salon should be looked at as well as the wide selection of chairs and bowl combinations that the industry offers. Not every style is suitable for every business so buyers should be aware of this.</p> \n<h3>Accessories</h3> \n<p>Shampoo chairs are designed for prepping the client\u2019s hair before the styling process begins, but modern chairs have a number of unique accessories built into them that can help to elevate the client\u2019s experience. Foot rests are a very popular accessory right now which helps to bring even more comfort to the client.

Valued at US $19.3 billion in 2021, theglobal faucet marketis projected to record a 7.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2022\u20132030.</p> \n<p>Innovations in the market and urbanization have contributed to market growth.

Furthermore, consumer income growth as people embrace remote work empowers them to have a modern home hence the growing demand for the products. Besides, the demand for basin faucets will hardly drop in the future since they are essential in every property.</p> \n<h2>Essential features of faucets</h2> \n<p>Kitchen and bathroom basin faucets have different features. Traditional ones are manually operated and come in simple designs, while modern ones have more features and functions through sensors. Whether looking for modern or traditional styles, check out the following features before choosing a model.</p> \n<h3>Control system</h3> \n<p>The valve apparatus, motion sensor, and detectors form the faucet control system. They direct water flow from the faucet neck to the sink. A valve-operated faucet is manual and ideal in a house without children or people with disability.</p> \n<p>Faucets with motion sensors or detectors are easy to operate and can function without touching. Such faucets are ideal for children\u2019s bathrooms or those used by elderly and disabled family members.</p> \n<p>A touchless basin faucet is ideal for bathrooms because it is more hygienic. It also helps to moderate water temperature using a mixer in the two taps. When choosing one, consider the control system and functionality to meet customer requirements.</p> \n<h3>Suitable dimensions for your sink</h3> \n<p>Sink size and location determine the type of faucet to choose. Kitchen sinks are bigger, and therefore a faucet with a long neck suits them. On the other hand, bathroom sinks are smaller and therefore require faucets with shorter necks.</p> \n<p>When choosing the kitchen or bathroom faucets, ensure they fit moderately within the width of the basin. This prevents water from splashing outside the sink, making the surrounding area wet. Furthermore, a well-fitting faucet is convenient to use and prevents water wastage.</p> \n<h3>Aesthetic value</h3> \n<p>Whether choosing faucets for a kitchen makeover or bathtub renovation, aesthetic value is a major factor to consider. The color of the surroundings and customers\u2019 taste influences the faucet choice for different sinks.</p> \n<p>A stainless steel kitchen sink matches apolishedbrass dual-handle faucet. The shiny, smooth surfaces are easy to clean and less sticky. Therefore, any grease from dirty utensils is easily washed away.</p> \n<p>The faucet color can also contrast that of the sink and look stylish. For example, apolished zinc alloyfaucet complements golden bathroom zinc, making it look modern and stylish.</p> \n<h3>Should be ADA-compliant</h3> \n<p>When choosing faucets for the kitchen sink or bathroom, ensure they accommodate persons with disability. This calls for the right size and easy-to-operate fixtures. For example, a basin faucet with a sensor is ideal for a visually impaired person, while one mounted within reach isaccessibleto older people.</p> \n<p>When fixing faucets, the space leading to where they are mounted should be free of obstruction with a non-slippery floor to avoid accidents.</p> \n<h3>Have additional accessories for improved efficiency</h3> \n<p>Dual handles, sensors, and detectors are some of the accessories that make faucets more efficient. Sensors help in operating them without touch hence keeping germs away. In addition, detectors help deliver water at the preferred temperature using the double-handlefaucet.</p> \n<p>Other features that make faucets more efficient include cross-shaped knobs for easy opening and closing,tallnecks for faster filling of bathtubs with water and push and pull handles. Dual taps and mixers help regulate water temperatures by blending hot and cold water.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when choosing faucets</h2> \n<p>The efficient functioning of basin faucets depends on many factors. Sink size, location in the house, and water source are some of the factors that influence their choice.</p> \n<h3>1. Location and use</h3> \n<p>A faucet for a kitchen sink should have a smooth surface and be easily accessible. Therefore, choose models with polished surfaces for easy cleaning and accessibility. On the other hand, a bathroom faucet mounted high on the wall for channeling water to a bathtub can betall with a single hole.</p> \n<h3>2. Source of water</h3> \n<p>Rain and treated water contain no dissolved ions, while water from boreholes and rivers is rich in minerals. An ideal faucet for a property where underground water is common should be polished or made fromstainless steel.</p> \n<p>Zinc faucets are ideal for rainy or soft water because zinc is reactive unless polished.</p> \n<h3>3. Control type</h3> \n<p>A valve-controlled faucet should be easy to operate and mounted within reach, whereas one with sensors can be tall and mounted higher.</p> \n<h3>4. Dimensions and space</h3> \n<p>The faucet size chosen should correspond to the sink. Faucets withlong necksare ideal for large kitchen sinks and bathtubs, while medium-sized ones are suitable for bathroom sinks.</p> \n<h2>Choose modern faucet designs for ultimate comfort</h2> \n<p>Modern designs and innovations have improved the style and functionality of faucets. Always evaluate your customers\u2019 needs, such as aesthetics, available space, and position, before choosing their models. Note that different customers have varying needs, and therefore, offer them a wide array to choose from.</p> \n<p>For ultimate comfort and stylish kitchens andbathrooms, look out for the latest trends in the market with a digital touch. For example, models with sensors and detectors are more robust, safe, and comfortable to use.</p> \n"}]}

These operate with an electrical-gas discharge lamp and will often have a much higher wattage when compared to other types of outdoor lighting that can be used for stadiums or arenas. Although they take a few short minutes to warm up, they\u2019re one of the mostefficient types of lightingin today\u2019s market which is why they\u2019re also used for billboards, street lighting, and in some cases outdoor parking lots.</p> \n<p>In the US alone,87% of outdoor stadium lightingcomes fromHID lights. The high output of this type of lighting means that it\u2019s limited in use to large outdoor spaces or warehouse and industrial areas, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that demand has continued to grow for HID lights in recent years, especially when it comes to arenas and stadiums.</p> \n<h3>Floodlights</h3> \n<p>Floodlightscan be used in a number of outdoor spaces, from gardens to parking lots, and\u00a0 they\u2019re especially popular for outdoor stadiums. The key factors to take into account when it comes to floodlights are their overall wattage and brightness, as well as their sturdiness. Outdoor stadiums need bright lights that are able to reach all corners of the field. This also helps with the visibility for not only the players, but also for the people watching from the sidelines or the stands.Floodlightshave always been a go-to source of stadium lighting because of this.</p> \n<p>And sincefloodlightsare predominantly used outside, it\u2019s vital that they\u2019re durable too. Making sure aflood lightcan withstand even the worst weather conditions is not only important for safety but also for peace of mind so that the consumer can depend on the longevity of their lighting system. In stadiums, floodlights will most likely be positioned at the top of a lighting pole for optimal brightness, and to ensure the brightness doesn\u2019t cause discomfort to anyone.</p> \n<h3>Canopy lights</h3> \n<p>Although quality lighting is essential for arenas and stadiums, lighting for the main building, parking garage, and seating areas is also vital.Canopy lightscan be used both indoors and outdoors, and they are mostly seen in parking or pedestrian areas. They\u2019re perfect for the types of parking garages that can be found at both arenas and stadiums, and they\u2019re also ideal for lighting tunnels as well as indoor pedestrian zones of the stadium.</p> \n<p>With the rise in demand of LED lighting, manycanopy lightsare now LED. The cost of running LED lights is much lower than in the past few years, so they\u2019re very popular among consumers who want to run more cost effective lighting in large spaces.Canopy lightsare easy to install, and they\u2019re normally hung from the ceiling, making them easy to access and maintain as well.</p> \n<h3>LED sports lights</h3> \n<p>LED lighting has had a positive impact on lighting trends around the world, from homes to businesses to sports venues. In terms ofLED sports lights, there are many benefits to take into account over traditional lighting. Overall,LED lightsconsume over 70% less energy than other light bulbs, which not only helps to cut costs but is also better for the environment. This also means that there is a decrease in the amount of maintenance required as they last longer and are built of a more durable material.</p> \n<p>Compared to traditional bulbs,LED lightsare significantly brighter and better at distributing light to all areas of the stadium or arena. This not only helps to improve the quality of the space, but it also helps to create a clearer picture if the event is being broadcast on live TV. It\u2019s worth noting that LED lights contain no toxic substances so when they\u2019re disposed of they won\u2019t cause any environmental damage in the long term.</p> \n<h2>The future of arena and stadium lighting</h2> \n<p>The best options for arena and stadium lighting not only benefit the players or performers, but also the spectators. Whether for afootball gameor for training, it\u2019s important to get the lighting correct for maximum visibility. Options such as the high intensity discharge light, the canopy light, floodlights, and LED sports lights are all in high demand in today\u2019s global market.</p> \n<p>As arena and stadium lighting leans towards LEDs for both indoor and outdoor lighting, the market is expecting more demand for this cost efficient solution. There are also expectations for new types of lighting to hit the market that will be eco-friendly and high-tech, with the implementation of smart devices being used to control brightness and add convenience.</p> \n"}]}

Between 2022 and 2027 this market is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 5.77%. This rise invalue is down to a number of factorssuch as an increase in construction and the implementation of innovative lighting technologies. The latest boho lighting ideas are helping to boost the lamps and lighting market as consumers look to change the theme of their rooms to fit in with their modern lifestyle.</p> \n<h2>What is \u201cboho\u201d design?</h2> \n<p>With a history dating back to 19th century Paris, Bohemian or boho design is still a very popular choice of interior design. This style focuses on unconventional beauty standards and is a blend of various cultures and ideals. It was inspired by nomads, artists, and writers who focused on the creative aspects of design rather than the monetary value. Overall, boho is an expansive category of design that\u2019s both quirky and naturalistic, and it\u2019s not expensive to pull off.</p> \n<h2>5 trendy boho lighting ideas</h2> \n<p>Whether it\u2019s lighting, furniture, or pieces of art, one thing that all boho decor hasin common is that it uses natural materials to create a warm and relaxed space. The latest trending boho lighting ideas include rattanpendant lighting, hanging macrame light shades, paper lanterns, light toned wood, and feathered lighting designs.</p> \n<h3>Rattan pendant lights</h3> \n<p>One of the most eco-friendly materials that can be used in home decor is rattan. It\u2019s a style that keeps coming back time and time again because of how versatile and strong it is.Rattanisn\u2019t a new boho lighting idea, but there are several new versions of this type of pendant lighting emerging that are more appealing to the modern day consumer.</p> \n<p>A popular rattan light for large spaces and dining rooms is thehanging chandelierwhich mimics the fancier chandeliers that are often associated with high-end decor.

There are plenty of different designs ofrattan pendant lightingavailable in today\u2019s market, and these examples only touch the surface of the shapes and styles that can act as a centerpiece to a space.</p> \n<h3>Hanging macrame light shades</h3> \n<p>For consumers who want something a little different than rattan,macrameis the perfect alternative that fits in beautifully with boho designs. Macrame is a unique form of textile produced by making knots in the fabric rather than weaving or knitting.

This is a simplistic look that\u2019s really starting to pick up steam with buyers.</p> \n<h3>Paper pendant lanterns</h3> \n<p>In the past, paper lanterns have been associated with outdoor parties or festivals, and originate from Chinese and Japanese culture.

Smaller lanterns can be placed together in bunches to make a type of art installation within the space, whereaslarger lanternscan be installed by themselves and are often hung over a living room table or entrance hall. With just this one type of boho lighting style, there are lots of options for consumers, which is one of the reasons why it\u2019s such an important trend to follow.</p> \n<h3>Light toned wood</h3> \n<p>The latest boho styles are all about having natural and eco-friendly materials incorporated into the interior design of a space. A top trend in today\u2019s market for boho lighting now includeslight toned woodwhich can take on different shapes and forms to create a very natural look as a stand-alone table or floor lamp. Woods such as oak and maple fit in perfectly with this type of tone, and it\u2019s not uncommon to see the original lines of the wood on show in order to keep things as natural as possible.</p> \n<p>Some of these lights will look to mimic the shape of a tree, and incorporatenatural looking curvesinto them as well as a slight thickness to the main body of the lamp. Others are designed very thin so they look like they\u2019re not there. For consumers who can\u2019t get enough of rattan though, there\u2019s always the option to combinerattan with light toned woodfor the ultimate boho lighting style.</p> \n<h3>Feathered lighting</h3> \n<p>Feathersare synonymous with boho designs, so it goes without saying that they\u2019re also incorporated into lighting trends too. The soft and fluffy look to this type of lighting is a stark contrast to wood and rattan, and is often preferred by consumers who want a more cozy look in their space. This feathery look can be toned down and neutral, or it can be bright white dotted with various colors to really make the lighting stand out.</p> \n<p>Feathered lighting can be used for both hanging lights and floor or table lamps, and both are big hits among consumers. Thefeathered ceiling lightwill emit a warm tone to the room, which often suits the natural decor and overall feel of the room better than other materials.Feathered lighting for floor lampscan equally make a space feel complete, and in many cases this type of lighting can include a unique body that makes it stand out too.</p> \n<h2>The future of boho decor</h2> \n<p>Boho isn\u2019t for everyone, but it\u2019s starting to gain traction among a large number of consumers as more people look to incorporate eco-friendly and sustainable decor into their rooms. There\u2019s also been an increase in the amount of modern hotels embracing the boho style to boost their appeal.</p> \n<p>The latest boho lighting ideas to keep an eye on include rattan pendant lighting, hanging macrame light shades, paper pendant lanterns, light toned wood lighting, and feathered lighting. As boho interiors grow in popularity, the market is expecting a surge in demand for unique forms of lighting to match their natural look.

One of the most popular light sources is downlights. Downlights vary in terms of application, material, and specifications. Sellers need to be knowledgeable and give the right advice based on the customers\u2019 needs. This article will equip business buyers with what they need to know for selling the right downlights.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are downlights?How to choose the best downlights to sell?Conclusion</p> \n<h2>What are downlights?</h2> \n<p>Downlights are also known as recessed lights, pot lights, or can lights. They are an ideal choice to use as ceiling lights in residential kitchens and bathrooms; or in commercial places, such as offices, shops, and hotels. They are adaptable and can be used for both indoor and outdoor spaces. They are very popular as they provide warm general lighting, can be functional ambient light, are space-saving due to their sizes, and suit low ceilings.</p> \n<h2>How to choose the best downlights to sell?</h2> \n<h3>Color temperature</h3> \n<p>Here are the top tips buyers need to consider when choosing the color for downlights at home. For areas that tend to get hot (e.g. kitchen and laundry room), offer customers to installcool white color downlights. On the other hand, in areas where you want to create a warm and intimate feeling, such as the living room and bedrooms,warm white color downlightsshould be a great option.</p> \n<p>For commercial areas like offices, it is better to get cool white color for bright and energetic feelings. Meanwhile, hotels, where people would like a warm feeling, should get warm light or warm white color. Whenever in doubt, the safe bet is getting thenatural white 4000K, which is usually suitable for all kinds of environments.</p> \n<h3>Beam angle</h3> \n<p>The beam angle of a bulb means how wide or narrow its beam of light is. Anarrow beam(20-40 degrees) is suitable for highlighting an area or object, mainly for accent lighting. It is suitable for hotels, shops, andofficeswhere people want to highlight a product or decoration.</p> \n<p>Downlights with a 25 degrees beam angle are suitable for kitchens as they can give people concentrated light while cooking. For soft diffuse lighting in the living room, 60 degrees of the beam angle is ideal. In contrast, awider beam, usually referring to 100-120 degrees, is suitable for general purposes.</p> \n<h3>Lumens and wattage</h3> \n<p>Similar to color temperature, the brightness level of a bulb can make a big difference to the look and feel of a room. Lumen (lm) is the unit to measure the brightness of a light bulb. A 60-watt incandescent bulb is similar to a LED downlight with 8-12 watts and 800 lm. For general use at home or in commercial areas, lumen counts between300 and 800 lmshould be a safe choice.</p> \n<h3>Placement</h3> \n<p>After examining the brightness of a downlight, another consideration is the distance between each light. Placing them too close together can result in inconsistent lighting. Spacing the downlights evenly ensures the light is comfortable and non-distracting.</p> \n<p>Also, consider the beam angles when deciding the spacing between them. If adopting a wider beam, space the downlights 1.2 to 1.5 m apart (approx. 3 feet 11 inches to 5 feet); if using a narrow beam, try to place them 1 m (about 3 feet 3 inches) away from each other.</p> \n<h3>Color rendering index (CRI)</h3> \n<p>Color rendering index (CRI) means the light source\u2019s ability to show the objects\u2019 colors faithfully in comparison with natural sunlight. It is measured from 0 to 100. 100 means the colors under the light are the same as they would if under natural sunlight. Typically,80 to 90 CRIcan reflect accurate color rendering.</p> \n<h3>Fire-rated downlights</h3> \n<p>No matter where the downlights are being installed, the rule of thumb is: safety is the priority. Generally, all downlights are tested and meet fire safety standards. Extra protection can make a big difference in case of fire, so choosingfire-rated downlightsis highly recommended.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>There are many other things to consider when giving consumers advice over choosing theperfect light. For instance, lightly colored walls appear brighter and better-lit than darker and light-absorbing surfaces. Another tip is to consider light-level dimmers with downlights to save electricity. Make sure they are compatible with each other and use a push-button dimmer.</p> \n<p>Stocking with the right types of quality downlights and giving knowledgeable advice will help attract customers and boost your business.

They are effective in emergencies and during power outages when the inverter battery conks out while occupants attempt to leave the building. However, finding the right product can be difficult, so here is a quick checklist to assist businesses with their research.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the emergency lighting industryFactors to consider when looking for emergency lightsTypes of emergency lighting systems</p> \n<h2>An overview of the emergency lighting industry</h2> \n<p>The emergencylightmarket was valued at USD5.48billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% to USD 10.73 billion by 2030. Increasing construction projects, government initiatives to support energy-efficient lighting solutions, and decreasing prices of LEDs are the main factors that have contributed to the advancement of this segment.</p> \n<p>The most important technological advancement in emergencylightinghas been the incorporation of LEDs in emergency exit lights. Furthermore, emergency lights are required by law in commercial buildings, fueling demand. However, the most significant barrier to market growth is the high capital investment and operational costs.</p> \n<p>This article offers tips to consider before purchasingemergency lights, so keep reading to find out more and make an informed decision.</p> \n<h3>What are emergency lights and how do they work?</h3> \n<p>An emergencylightautomatically activates a battery-powered lamp, and its purpose is to provide light in emergencies so people can find a safe path. The emergency light circuit replaces incandescent lamps with light-emitting diodes, making it more power efficient and bright.</p> \n<p>Each emergencylightis connected to the building\u2019s electrical supply, and each light has its own circuit. These lights also have a backup battery to keep them running during a power outage. However, because the lifespan of these batteries is typically shorter than that of other types oflighting, they must be regularly checked to ensure that they can power the emergency lights for at least 90 minutes. Professionals must test the batteries every six months.</p> \n<p>In the market, there are different types of emerginglightsin various shapes and sizes. Each light is tailored to its intended use. The NEC (National Electric Code) requires the installation of emergency lights in all public and commercial establishments, such as government offices, theaters, warehouses, retail outlets, and factories.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when looking for emergency lights</h2> \n<p>One should not choose any emergencylighton the market without ensuring that it possesses all of the desirable qualities customers seek. So, if you need help choosing the right product in today\u2019s market, here are a few pointers on settling on the best emergency lights.</p> \n<p>Brightness is, without a doubt, an important criterion in emergencylights. It is critical that the light be sufficiently bright so that the exit path is clear and people can use it as intended. When the light is dim, people may miss the sign and thus be unable to leave quickly. At the floor level, the emergency lights should not be illuminated at less than 0.5 lux.</p> \n<p>Another factor to consider in industrial emergencylightsis their quality. In most cases, they are made using anodized aluminum and are quite tough. Other materials are also used to manufacture emergency lights, but aluminum is the most common option.</p> \n<p>It is a good idea to look into waterprooflightsbecause they can sometimes be placed in open areas, exposing them to rain, which can have an impact on the performance of the lights.</p> \n<p>It is also critical to consider the battery backup time. The backup time refers to the amount of time thelampcan operate at full brightness and without fluctuation after it has been fully charged. The average backup time for the most available lights today is 4 to 8 hours. Lights that offer more than 10 hours of battery backup are an excellent choice.</p> \n<p>Always look into the charging options available with thelamp. For example, check whether it supports solar charging, grid charging, or both. Products that support both grid and solar charging are an excellent choice. Furthermore, the charging time needed to charge the lamp fully should not exceed 10 hours.</p> \n<p>LED lights are a good choice as they are highly efficient, contain no toxic elements such as mercury, and are relatively eco-friendly. They also have a long service life, eliminating users\u2019 need to charge or replace the bulbs. MostLEDlights have a lifespan of 10,000 to 50,000 hours. These lights are inexpensive and provide instant illumination. Furthermore,LEDlight prices have steadily decreased, with the average emergency light costing between USD 35 and USD 60, depending on the brightness and quality of the product.</p> \n<p>Additional requirements for emergency lighting:</p> \n<p>\u2013 Sign covers: With the help of protective covers, the lifespan of the emergencylightscan be increased. They protect the emergency lighting investment and are a cheap add-on.\u2013 Emergency ballasts: Backup replacements and ballasts offer efficient and lastinglightingsolutions. They add an extra layer of security, maximizing safety.\u2013 Power inverters: Inverters provide power to the lightingfixturesduring a power outage. They convert energy from a DC battery to AC voltage so an uninterrupted power supply is available during emergencies.</p> \n<h2>Types of emergency lighting systems</h2> \n<p>As previously stated, there are differentlighting systemsdesigned for different spaces. Let\u2019s break each one down:</p> \n<h3>Maintained and non-maintained lights</h3> \n<p>Maintainedlightsare illuminated 24/7 and rely on battery power to stay lit during power outages. The light is most commonly an LED and is often used as escape route lighting in different buildings such as hospitals andoffices. Amaintainedlight is more flexible and can be programmed to come on before and during a power outage. They are used to avoid total darkness in a room and are typically used in cinemas.</p> \n<p>On the other hand,non-maintainedlights are not flexible and only come into motion when a power cut is detected. Their only power source is the battery charged by the mains. However, these lights are less expensive, eco-friendly, and tend to be the most popular option. Note that they require a constant flow of electricity to keep charged. Thus, theselightsonly signal the emergency exits during an emergency to show occupants the way out.</p> \n<h3>Sustained emergency lighting</h3> \n<p>The sustained light is a mix of non-maintained and maintainedlight. It is typically used when both an emergency and a standard light are required. For example, an entryway must be lit during the day and serve as an emergency exit during a power outage. The battery supply inside the fixture will keep the LED light on during a power outage.</p> \n<h3>Temporary lighting</h3> \n<p>Power outages can occur in hospitals and fire stations, and temporary lighting helps occupants in the dark. They come in various sizes and can be used both outdoors and indoors.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Thermoplastic: These lights are reliable and cheap, costing less than USD 20 per unit. However, these lights can only be used indoors.</p> \n<p>\u2013 Steel: Available in various wattage and voltage capacities, steel is most commonly used in warehouses, factories, and institutions. These lights can be controlled remotely.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Consumer expectations continue to shift as technology advances. Incorporating LED technology in emergency lighting has resulted in significant market growth as they are cost-effective, require no maintenance, and are efficient.

The demand for LED floodlights is constantly increasing as we need them almost everywhere in cities. Here is the latest buying guide to floodlights; it includes what floodlights are, the difference between different types, and how to choose the right ones for consumers.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhat are flood lights?What are the types of floodlights?How to choose floodlights?Conclusion</p> \n<h2>What are flood lights?</h2> \n<p>Flood lightsare high-powered electric lights that can be used to light up large areas. Outdoor flood lights are important for workers and pedestrians, as they promote safe walking between buildings and parking lots at night. They are also essential for tennis courts, basketball fields, and football fields for night games. They can be used as outdoor lighting, for example, as street lights, billboards, signs, building names, business names, and addresses, so that information can be easily spotted by people.</p> \n<p>Apart from outdoor purposes, floodlights are very useful for indoor areas, for example, in theaters and stadiums. And of course, for home use, they give great ambiance for house frontage and garden. They play an important role in security as well.</p> \n<p>Different types of floodlights are used for many other purposes. LED floodlights are usually the top pick, as they are more energy efficient, better looking, easier to use, lower maintenance, and safer than other lights.</p> \n<h2>What are the types of floodlights?</h2> \n<p>There are five common types of floodlights: sodium, halogen, high-intensity discharge, incandescent, and fluorescent. To decide which is the best option for customers, it is necessary to understand their differences, how they work, and the advantages and disadvantages of each type.</p> \n<h3>Sodium Flood Light</h3> \n<p>Sodium flood lightis low pressure, and the light will be on when exposed to electric current. It is considered one of the most energy-saving choices among all the different flood lights, and it is low maintenance. The downside of the sodium flood light is its yellowish color, so it may not be the best choice for security lights, and some people may prefer white light.</p> \n<h3>Halogen</h3> \n<p>This type of floodlight works when the electricity activates the halogen gas and tungsten in the quartzhalogen bulbs. It is white light, which most people prefer, but it is less efficient than sodium flood lights and high-intensity discharge lights.</p> \n<h3>High-intensity discharge</h3> \n<p>High-intensity discharge flood lightshave internal ballast inside the bulb so that an electric arc can glow and produce light. They have the longest lifespans and the highest efficiency rating compared to the other types of flood lights. They are also more efficient than incandescent flood lights, but they take longer time to produce full lighting, which is why they are not good with motion detectors or motion sensors.</p> \n<h3>Incandescent</h3> \n<p>Incandescent flood lightsare heated up by an electric current. They have low initial installation costs, so they are a good choice if the budget is limited. As for the disadvantages, they have shorter lifespans.</p> \n<h3>Fluorescent</h3> \n<p>Somefluorescent flood light bulbs contain mercury gas and a phosphorescent coating on the inside surface of the bulb. Therefore, when an electric current passes through the coating, the bulb will start to glow. It is a long-lasting lighting solution compared to incandescent bulbs, but the initial cost is comparatively higher.</p> \n<h2>How to choose floodlights?</h2> \n<h3>Lumens vs. watts</h3> \n<p>While watts measure the power a lamp uses, lumens measure the quantity of light it produces. The higher the lumen rating, the brighter the light bulb will be.</p> \n<h3>How many lumens do you need?</h3> \n<p>Different environments or properties need different brightness. To give a general idea, an average office may need 300-500 lux, while a room at home or indoor use needs 50 lux, and a supermarket needs1000 lux.</p> \n<h3>Spacing</h3> \n<p>Several things need to be considered when choosing the right floodlight, including the height and angle of the lights, the lumen output, and the lighting ambiance that people want in place. Depending on different customers\u2019 preferences, some may want a certain extent of overlapping or cross-over lighting.</p> \n<h3>Cross-over lighting</h3> \n<p>It comes from different light fixtures to balance the light and cut back on the shadow. For example, there is almost no shadow when standing on a tennis court atnightwith the flood lights on. This is because the lights are coming from different directions, which reduces shadows.</p> \n<h3>Choose the color</h3> \n<p>Different factors, like environment, usage, and people\u2019s preferences will determine a different choice of color temperature. As a general guide on the light color:3000Kwill be warm color, mainly for homes and restaurants, or small areas;4000Kwill be a natural color, mainly for work areas and meeting rooms;5000Kwill be a cool white color that feels like daylight or bright light, good for large spaces and outdoor areas.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>LED bulbs are a better choice and higher-quality product than other floodlights in terms of technology and efficiency. No matter if you are replacing the old lighting or installing them for new places, LEDs are the right choice for gardens, business buildings, parking lots, warehouses, stadiums, outdoor security lighting, and more!

This is illustrated by the diagram below:</p> \n<p>LED grow lights are more efficient than HPS or HID grow lights, as they convert a greater proportion of the electrical energy into lighting, rather than into thermal waste. That\u2019s why an 800W LED grow light can replace a 1000W HPS light, in terms of PPFD (light intensity). For cultivation that requires targeted lighting sources, LED is the only choice.</p> \n<p>In the past, large-wattage LED grow lights have led to a host of issues, including within the realms of heat and safety. However, due to the many benefits, the quest for strong and safe light intensity remains an enduring mission for all growers and manufacturers. Mars Hydro is no exception.</p> \n<p>At the end of 2022, Mars Hydro released its 1000W LED grow light.</p> \n<h2>FC-E1000W: basic specifications</h2> \n<p>The Mars HydroFC-E1000Wcomes equipped with 10 light bars and is installed with 4,910 pcs of BridgeLux diodes, providing a Photosynthetic Photon Flux (PPF) of 2,766 \u03bcmol/S and a color temperature of 3416K with a power consumption of 1,000 Watts. It is capable of operating at AC voltages of 100V to 277V with relative amperages.</p> \n<h2>FC-E1000W: innovative designs for diverse\u00a0indoor grows</h2> \n<p>The Mars Hydro FC-E1000W is more than just a ubiquitous 1000W LED grow light. It offers unique designs, designed by Mars Hydro\u2019s own R&D department, that provide essential features to promote plant growth. In addition, it comes with special structures to suit many practical applications. Some of these are explored below:</p> \n<h3>Targeted full spectrum lighting for indoor growing</h3> \n<p>The full spectrum has proven to be the most effective spectra in the world of indoor cultivation, but the percentage of \u201ccolors\u201d in the PAR range varies among LED manufacturers.</p> \n<p>Mars Hydro has been researching and engineering spectrum designs to identify a beneficial and universal spectrum for growers around the world:</p> \n<p>Spectrum: 660-665nm, 2800-3000K, 4800-5000K</p> \n<p>Rich in red, blue, and green (a spectrum that proves indispensable), the Mars HydroFC-E1000WLED grow light supports the full cycle of growth, from seed to harvest \u2014 not too much red to cause the growth of long and fragile stems at the seedling stage, nor too little red to cause the growth of thin leaves and small buds.</p> \n<p>Every spectrum is just right. The blue spectrum plays a role in plant growth, stimulating plant growth with the best efficacy. It encourages stronger seedlings and causes the plant\u2019s leaves to grow wider to capture more light, meaning the plant feeds more and there is an increased accumulation of plant-based phytochemical to produce thicker leaves and greater buds.</p> \n<p>The red and deep red spectrum are the most effective food for the plants to absorb (especially during the flowering phase). Here, this informative spectrum induces the flowering stage and the sleeping period to speed up the growth process.</p> \n<p>The green spectrum barely plays a role in photosynthesis and there is no scientific evidence for its effectiveness, however, it has been shown to be an indispensable spectrum in thousands of experiments. Cultivation without a green spectrum is fragile, lacking in nutrients, and slow!</p> \n<p>This plant-centric spectrum from Mars Hydro is based on scientific analyses and experimentation to provide universal, full-spectrum lighting for indoor growing.</p> \n<h3>Scalable flexibility: extendable brackets for two cultivation settings</h3> \n<p>Growers familiar with Mars Hydro know that theFC-E Series LED grow lightsare flexible, since they do not come in one solid form but instead require assembly, offering the possibility of DIY assemblage.</p> \n<p>In addition to a flexible design, the FC-E1000W LED grow light provides another type of scalable flexibility \u2014 extendable brackets.</p> \n<p>In its standard form with optimum performance, the FC-E1000W is a 1.2\u00d71.2m LED light that covers a 4x4ft area and emits an output of up to 2,000 \u03bcmol/m\u00b2/s of PPFD.</p> \n<p>However, as many growers and farms will not need such an intense grow light continuously, Mars Hydro has paired 2 extended support bars and brackets with the FC-E1000W to \u201ctransform\u201d it into a 1.7\u00d71.2m LED grow light. This new size covers a 4x6ft grow space but has a slightly lower intensity.</p> \n<p>In this extended form, the output of theFC-E1000Wis still strong, consuming 1000W, but is not too intense for private growers and small-room operators. The PPFD in this form (4x6ft coverage) ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 \u03bcmol/m\u00b2/s.</p> \n<p>This extended form was originally designed for 4\u00d76 or 4\u00d78 grow tents, and mainly for commercial projects with rolling tables / rolling benches / grow trays. Commercial managers could also use the extended FC-E1000W as a 4-ft-wide LED grow light or a 6-ft-wide grow light to fit in many indoor grow room designs.</p> \n<p>Additionally, DIY enthusiasts can use the two extended support bars to build side or bottom lighting for the plants. In the end, it\u2019s all about imagination and electrical knowledge, however, it is of paramount importance to always consider safety.</p> \n<h3>Commercial grow light designs for easier management</h3> \n<p>Are there any commercially-viable LED grow lights that still cannot be daisy-chained and dimmed?</p> \n<p>The Mars HydroFC-E1000WLED grow light features a daisy-chaining capacity of 30 grow lights in a series and its dimming range is from 0 to 100% with no fixed light levels.</p> \n<p>These two features are important for commercial grows, saving on operation time and manual labor, as well as dynamically matching the DLI (Daily Light Integral) of plants.</p> \n<p>A well-controlled grow room should always be convenient.</p> \n<h2>FC-E1000W: the \u201cextreme\u201d PPFD chart</h2> \n<p>Among industry standards, PPFD is the most important and the easiest to measure.</p> \n<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this article, grow results in cannabis cultivation are near proportional to grow light intensity before the peak of 2,000 \u03bcmol/m\u00b2/s is reached.</p> \n<p>Operators usually leverage the strongest PPFD three weeks before the end of the flowering stage. In this way, the buds are bigger, have more pollen, and a better flavor. Once at the peak, correct light penetration can be a deep downward light, meaning the side branches receive sufficient photons to grow chunky buds.</p> \n<p>But not all cultivation can handle a PPFD this high. So, there\u2019s another conventional peak, which is the optimal point for personal indoor growers: 1,000 \u03bcmol/m\u00b2/s.</p> \n<p>For this reason, the existence of one light able to emit both these peaks is a great aid in cannabis cultivation. The FC-E1000W LED grow light has no problem achieving these two peak points while staying cool and safe:</p> \n<p>Below is the PPFD chart for the FC-E1000W LED grow light:</p> \n<p>The above chart shows that the Mars Hydro FC-E1000W is one of the best 4\u00d74 CO2 LED grow lights on the market. It is perfect for cultivation, with the highest concentration of supplemented carbon dioxide to increase growth and production at incredible speed.

Children are double their birth length at five years, growing at approximately 7.6 cm every year from age 1-10.</p> \n<p>As kids grow, mothers are excited to see them transition from their cots to toddler beds and then to kid\u2019s beds.</p> \n<p>However, parents can easily get overwhelmed in making the right decision with a baby to care for, handling office work, and various kid\u2019s beds in the market.</p> \n<p>Several factors go into choosing the ideal kid\u2019s bed that provides comfortable and sound sleep. This article addresses these factors, and the types of beds parents can choose for their kids.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsFactors to consider when choosing kids\u2019 bedTypes of kid\u2019s bedConclusion</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when choosing kids\u2019 bed</h2> \n<p>Selecting kids\u2019 beds is no simple task for caring parents. The bed should provide good sleep in a good posture and provide comfort.</p> \n<p>Although different parents have unique preferences when buying their kids\u2019 beds, there are universal factors they should consider. Here are the major factors buyers should check.</p> \n<h3>Type of material used</h3> \n<p>Before settling for kids\u2019 beds online, a parent should check the type of materials used to construct the bed. If it is a wooden kids\u2019 bed, they should look for high-quality and durable wood.</p> \n<p>Kids like playing and jumping on their beds. Hence there\u2019s a need for quality material that can withstand harsh treatment. While most beds are made of strong wood, some are made from plastic.</p> \n<p>For instance, thecar beds for kids are made of ABS plastic, considered strong structurally and resistant to external impact. This material makes this luxury children\u2019s bed lightweight and portable enough to move from one room to another during cleaning.</p> \n<h3>Durability</h3> \n<p>Durability is closely linked to the type of material used. Children are known to be playful and jumpy, not just in school but even in bed. A parent who wants to buy a kid\u2019s bed should evaluate if the bed is strong enough to handle the pressure for a long time.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, most modern-day beds are designed with strong and light wood; in some cases, metal plates are used on the joints to enhance durability.</p> \n<p>For example, theprincess kid\u2019s bedis fitted with a high-density rebound sponge that enables kids to play without losing shape. The frame of this luxury children\u2019s bed is made of solid hand-carved wood that increases the bed\u2019s stability to ensure kids play and sleep safely.</p> \n<h3>The number of kids</h3> \n<p>This factor also determines the type of bed a parent can buy. A bunk bed is ideal for two kids since it\u2019s comfortable and can accommodate two children. It also saves space, leaving the room for other essential furniture.</p> \n<p>However, a family with one child can choose a single bed, like abed house for kidswith a convertible and ample storage space to keep toys or clothes.</p> \n<h3>Design and finish</h3> \n<p>Every household has unique rooms, so a parent will likely have to choose a bed that matches their child\u2019s room.</p> \n<p>Designs like normal kids\u2019 beds, bunk beds, and cribs for toddlers are available offline and online shops.Bunk bedsare ideal for a family that wants a portable and pleasing design. These beds have multiple finishes, such as honey, walnut, and mahogany.</p> \n<h3>Space requirement</h3> \n<p>Available space is one of the most important factors in determining the bed a parent should choose. Planning a room to create space seems like playing Tetris, wrong calculation, and the bed will not fit.</p> \n<p>If the kid\u2019s room is small or medium, choosing akid\u2019s foldable bedwill make more sense. So, it\u2019s essential to consider room measurements before buying a kid\u2019s bed.</p> \n<h3>Age of the child</h3> \n<p>Children outgrows their beds with time. The bed toddlers spend the night on is not the bed they will spend on when they are five years or teenagers. Therefore, age dictates the type of bed the kid sleeps on. Small children may prefer something other than large and high beds because they spend more time playing on the floor.</p> \n<p>Conversely, older kids would need spacious beds to lounge and sleep in. Grown-up kids are particular about color and design, so a parent needs to know this or shop for a bed with their grown children.</p> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>Price is essential when making any purchases, including kids\u2019 beds.</p> \n<p>In the market, there will always be cheap and pricey beds. Costly beds are often more durable and comfortable, giving more value to money spent. On the other hand, cheap beds may not last long enough or handle the rough treatment.</p> \n<p>Therefore, buyers would have to strike a balance between quality and prices. However, if they can afford a luxurious bed for their children, it is okay to buy the best.</p> \n<h2>Types of kid\u2019s beds</h2> \n<p>Many parents are familiar with regular types like bunk and single kids\u2019 beds, but there are various types and sub-types to choose from.

They further save space in a room with extra storage space beneath the lower bed and cabins beside it.</p> \n<p>Parents and children can choose various bunkbed designs, from super-hero-themed bunk beds to nature and sports-inspired themes. They can also opt for family bunk beds, three-tiered bunks, triple bunk beds, and bunk with storage solutions.</p> \n<p>Bunk beds are suitable for older kids with proper coordination to avoid falls. The ladder helps to ensure safety, but older children can easily transverse the bed.</p> \n<h3>Cabin beds</h3> \n<p>Children and teenagers adore cabin beds. These unique kid\u2019s beds comprise an elevated frame lower than a bunk bed and the potential to attach additional accessories. Cabin beds are suitable for a room with limited space. Plus, it has in-built storage.</p> \n<p>Also, its height varies, so both small and older children can feel comfortable. Some manufacturers call them mid-sleepers because the height lies between a single bed and a bunk bed. The ladder helps young ones climb onto taller cabins.</p> \n<p>Most children love cabin beds with enclosed resting places, making it look like they are sleeping in a separate house. The cabin beds allow kids to read without turning the main switch on or off.</p> \n<p>Some cabin beds also have a tiny cupboard, a desk, and a built-in bookcase for school children.</p> \n<h3>Single beds</h3> \n<p>As the name suggests, these beds are the classic individual beds common in many homes and restrooms. This bed style comes in different designs and colors.</p> \n<p>Single bedscan have a twin or a double bed that slides underneath the main bed, making them perfect for small spaces.

One can choose from castle-themed to spaceship-themed single beds, thus transforming a kid\u2019s bedroom interior to another level.</p> \n<h3>Car bed</h3> \n<p>A bed shouldn\u2019t be a plain boring unit of furniture, especially for kids. Sleeping should be fun. Hence, the bed should also fan the kids\u2019 imaginations, fulfilling their ideal fantasies.Car bedshelp realize this goal.</p> \n<p>These beds look like flashy cars and are available in different designs and types, including racer car beds, sports car beds, and fire truck beds.

They can accommodate one or two kids depending on the chosen design.</p> \n<h3>Loft bed</h3> \n<p>Many people confuse loft beds with bunk beds because of their striking similarities.Loft bedsare higher sleeper beds with elevated frames and ample storage space underneath.</p> \n<p>They are often used to stretch spaces in kid bedrooms or for college students because they occupy less space than regular beds. Therefore, households with less space can consider loft beds.</p> \n<p>These beds come in a wide range of designs since the frame is versatile. However, they aren\u2019t suitable for small children because they are high. So, it\u2019s advisable for parents to wait until their children are old enough to climb up the bed before investing in it.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Choosing a kid\u2019s bed can be challenging; with the right information, users may never go wrong. A kid\u2019s bed should accommodate them for years before outgrowing them.</p> \n<p>Apart from space requirements, parents should also consider their kids\u2019 ages, the type of material used, design, and budget.

However, each parent tends to have different specifications, making the kid\u2019s crib business slightly tricky.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, businesses can leverage this complexity by offering various types and shapes to meet different standards. They can also consider multiple factors before stocking up on baby cribs.</p> \n<p>This buying guide will provide retailers with all the necessary details to help them make an impact in the kid\u2019s crib market.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsSeven factors to consider before purchasing baby cribsFour crib types parents will loveWhat is the potential of the kid\u2019s cribs market?Concluding words</p> \n<h2>Seven factors to consider before buying baby cribs</h2> \n<h3>Features</h3> \n<p>Consider what consumers expect froma crib. Most variants present numerous options, from models that have stationery designs to types standing on wheels. Interestingly, some cribs grow with the child, while others come with an added changing table.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s not all. Retailers may invest inhybrid cribs. For example, they can opt for convertible variants equipped with wheels.</p> \n<h3>Consumer\u2019s available space</h3> \n<p>Most consumers search for cribs based on their measurements and how much space they have. In response, businesses offer various types to accommodate different size requirements. However, take note that frames and external measurements may also affect the size of the cribs.</p> \n<p>Generally, combo cribs require the most space, while portable cribs offer the smallest footprint. In addition, convertible variants are somewhere in between the combo and portable cribs.</p> \n<p>Usually, combo cribs come with built-in changing tables, which helps to increase their space factor. However, many consumers consider them space-saving baby cribs since they take up less space than separate changing tables and cribs.</p> \n<p>Consumers without enough room area for a full-size crib will demand mini models. Mini cribs are similar to standard-sized variants but in smaller dimensions. Hence, retailers can stock up on mini portable, convertible, and combo cribs.</p> \n<h3>Crib\u2019s shape</h3> \n<p>Retailers can purchase cribs in various sizes, particularly rectangular and oval. Cocoon-like (or oval) round cribs are rare and many consumers consider them stylish and unique. Despite how safe and cute they are, not all parents will want them.</p> \n<p>Oval cribs look better in big nurseries where they stand out as the room\u2019s centerpiece. They won\u2019t squeeze into the corner likerectangular cribs. In addition, oval cribs require special add-ons like matching mattresses and sheets, making them more expensive deals.</p> \n<p>Consider opting for rectangular-shaped cribs since they\u2019re more common and appeal to a wider audience.Rectangular mattressesand sheets are also more widespread and would appeal to most consumers, especially variants with eye-catching and baby-compatible prints and designs.</p> \n<h3>Mattress size and type</h3> \n<p>Different cribs can accommodate variousmattress typesand sizes, giving consumers many options. Retailers can profit from the kid\u2019s crib business by stocking up on mattresses that fit their crib offers.</p> \n<p>When investing in crib mattresses, one of the first things to do is choose betweeninnerspring and foamvariants. Then, retailers can opt for extra functions, like dual-sided crib mattresses that grow with the crib.</p> \n<p>Interestingly,full-size cribsuse standard-size mattresses. According to U.S. regulations, standard-size cribs should be 52\u215c\u00b1\u215d inches in length by 28\u00b1\u215d inches in width. In addition, standard crib mattresses must be a minimum of 27\u00bc inches by 51\u215d inches and have nothing more than a 6-inch thickness.</p> \n<p>In contrast,mini crib and mattresssizes can vary, making it necessary for businesses to tread carefully when investing. Mini cribs often measure 38\u201d by 24\u201d inches, and most mini mattresses follow those measurements.</p> \n<h3>Mattress support</h3> \n<p>Sturdiness and support are other key factors sellers must consider before purchasing baby cribs. Businesses can choose between cribs with metal bars, metal frames (with spring wires), wooden slats, or board support.</p> \n<p>Consumers may gravitate toward cribs with wire spring mattress support because they offer the sturdiest base and better support for jumping toddlers. In addition, businesses can capitalize on models with adjustable mattress support.</p> \n<p>Not only is this feature more appealing, but also allows consumers to move from the highest setting for newborn babies to lower ones as the kid grows. Interestingly, kid cribs often offer two to five adjustments, but it depends on the model.</p> \n<p>Retailers can focus on cribs with two to three-three layer mattress support, as most parents are comfortable with such models.</p> \n<h3>Consumers\u2019 height</h3> \n<p>While standard cribs work for taller consumers, businesses can offer low-profile cribs for shorter parents. Such designs feature minimalistic frames and short legs, which makes them easier to access.</p> \n<p>In addition, low-profile cribs don\u2019t compromise baby safety as they offer similar mattress-to-railing heights. However, their shorter legs and unique frame reduce the overall length, making it easy for shorter parents to reach their kids.</p> \n<h3>Safety measures</h3> \n<p>Retailers must avoid stocking up on cribs that fall below safety standards\u2014regardless of features and designs. Generally, cribs manufactured before July 2011 are red zones because they don\u2019t meet the stricter safety standards set by the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission).</p> \n<p>One crucial banned feature to watch out for is dropping side cribs. The design led to many injuries and even a few deaths, making such models unacceptable for retail. Instead, sellers can opt for models with sturdy frames, safety features (railings, etc.), adequate mattress support, and adjustment.</p> \n<h2>Four crib types parents will love</h2> \n<h3>Standard cribs</h3> \n<p>Standard cribsare the regular models without fancy features. They don\u2019t have wheels, additional storage underneath, or even convert. In addition, these cribs are safe and incredibly affordable.</p> \n<p>Although they have some appealing benefits, most parents tend to shy away fromstandard cribs. They\u2019re slowly withdrawing from the market since other cribs with extra features are dominating sales. Nevertheless, parents with a thing for vintage items and basic designs will love these crib types.</p> \n<h3>Extra storage cribs</h3> \n<p>As the name implies,extra storage cribscome with extra compartments for consumers having space issues. Sellers may offer three models, including cribs with built-in trundle drawers under the mattress area, an attached changing table, or under crib drawers and changing tables.</p> \n<h3>Portable cribs</h3> \n<p>Portable cribsare variants that are incredibly easy to move around. More importantly, they serve as a category consisting of diverse products ranging from models with home-tied portability to cribs consumers can carry on trips.</p> \n<p>Thesekid\u2019s cribscan feature metal, wooden, or acrylic frames that balance on wheels. Businesses can stock up on portable models in full- or mini-size. Some variants may even offer foldable features for easy storage.</p> \n<h3>Convertible cribs</h3> \n<p>Convertible cribscan grow with the baby due to their incredible versatility and long-term use. Interestingly, they\u2019re widespread in the crib market and can evolve to accommodate one or several larger beds.</p> \n<p>Usually, these variants have up to three categories that offer varying numbers of conversions. Retailers may offer 2-in-1convertible models(crib and one bed), 3-in-1 convertible variants (crib and two beds), and 4-in-1 convertibles (crib and three beds).</p> \n<h2>What is the potential of the kid\u2019s cribs market?</h2> \n<p>Experts predict theworld baby crib marketwill grow to $1.67 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 4.6% over the forecast period. The industry\u2019s potential is attributable to the increasing popularity and usage of baby care items like cribs, strollers, and monitors.</p> \n<p>Technological advancements also help drive this market\u2019s growth by creating innovations\u2014like the converting crib. The rising disposable incomes and standard of living also help drive opportunities for sellers in the kid\u2019s crib industry.</p> \n<p>The convertible crib product segment shows the highest potential by accounting for the largest share of the global market (over 53%) in 2018. Experts expect the segment to register steady growth from 2019 to 2025.</p> \n<p>In 2018, North America emerged as the dominant region, accounting for over 32% of the global market. According to research, the region will hold its dominant position and steadily expand over the forecast period. Asia Pacific is expected to register the fastest CAGR from 2019 to 2025.</p> \n<h2>Concluding words</h2> \n<p>Baby cribs are witnessing increased traction as more parents prioritize baby safety. Interestingly, the market is booming with retail opportunities due to technological advancements and the rising consumer interest and standard of living.</p> \n<p>Convertible cribs show the highest potential due to their versatility and long-term use. Portable cribs make moving around the house or traveling with babies easier, while models with extra storage help consumers with space problems.</p> \n<p>Lastly, standard cribs may not be as widespread as the others but will thrive as a niche item. Businesses can follow this purchasing guide for an increased market presence and sales.</p> \n"}]}

Modern garage doors with glass add a touch of sophistication to a home. They also allow natural light to enter the garage, making it a more inviting and airy space.</p> \n<p>However, some see-through garage doors sell faster, while others need more market traction. This post is for sellers that want to know how to choose profitable garage doors with high demand.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhy selling glass garage doors may be your next cash cowThings to consider when choosing glass garage doors for saleWrapping up</p> \n<h2>Why selling glass garage doors may be your next cash cow</h2> \n<p>In 2021, the global garage door market expanded toUS$6.79 billionand is expected to maintain a steady CAGR of 5.2% from 2022 to 2029. A substantial share of this increase owes to\u00a0 2022\u2019s US$2.2 billiondemand for residential garage doors.</p> \n<p>Arecent studyalso revealed the expansion of manufacturers\u2019 production to meet homeowners\u2019 increasing demand for insulated glass garage doors with contemporary aesthetics. The demand for glass garage doors was also said to have increased by75%over the last three years, with Clopay, Wayne-Dalton, and Overhead Door as some of the industry\u2019s key players. These doors are no longer exclusive to garages. They are now relics in restaurants, offices, and other commercial buildings, thanks to their versatility, low maintenance, durability, and ability to save space.</p> \n<h2>Things to consider when choosing glass garage doors</h2> \n<h3>Size and weight</h3> \n<p>Size matters. A one-car garage and a two-car garage typically use doors that are 8 feet tall, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall, 18 feet wide, respectively. So, depending on the customer\u2019s garage size, sellers can stock up on a glass single-car garage door or a 2-car glass garage door.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the load impact of a garage door on the floor should be considered. For example, insulation can add about 200 pounds to glass garage roll-up doors and, as such, can wreak havoc onvinyl flooringover time.</p> \n<h3>Style</h3> \n<p>Roll-ups are contemporary glass garage doors used as closet doors and openings in entertainment rooms. There are also commercial glass roll-up doors used in warehouses and other heavy-duty settings. Roll-ups are ideal for creating a chic, contemporary, industrial look. And since they recess to the ceiling, roll-ups are space-saving but are a potential safety hazard to children, posing many maintenance issues.</p> \n<p>Sliding glass garage doorsare currently used inrevving up home gyms, game rooms, home offices, workshops, mancaves, and whatnot. They make exclusive spaces accessible, especially to people in wheelchairs. Garage sliding glass doors have fewer moving parts, so they are easier to maintain\u2014though expensive and tricky to install.</p> \n<p>Folding doors come in various designs, from canopy-type bifold, which are ideal for deflecting snow, to bifold glazed overhead doors, which are great for revealing garages containing exotic cars.Bifold glass garage doorsare generally easy to automate. They are visually appealing and offer greater security. Unfortunately, bi-folds are tricky to operate and are quite expensive.</p> \n<p>Sectional glass garage doors are a good choice for homeowners who value elegant modern designs. Car collectors with collective garages can secure better ventilation and lighting to their collection by installing a sectional glass door. However, given that sectional doors are made with panels sophisticatedly hinged together, they are tricky to install, repair, and modify.</p> \n<h3>Frame material</h3> \n<p>Glass aluminium garage doors are a common sight in cities. Aluminum is a lightweight material, which is why aluminium garage doors with glass are easier to control. Also due to the light weightiness, little or no strain is exerted on the glass panels. So, they barely crack. Aluminum-framed glass garage doors are also non-corrosive, therefore ideal in locations with high rainfall.</p> \n<p>A wood glass garage door combines the reflective power of a glass garage door with the nature-given beauty of wood. However, because wood is a target to termites and other wood-destructing pests, commercial buildings and homeowners often go forwood color aluminum garage doorswhich are aluminum-framed but, nevertheless, resemble\u00a0 wood-framed doors.</p> \n<p>Steel frames are as enduring as aluminum and as traditional as wooden frames. They are more customizable and can withstand severe home climates, while still offering modern aesthetics. However,a steel glass garage doorisn\u2019t as energy efficient and requires an adequate inspection to catch and treat the build-up of rust.</p> \n<p>Frameless garage doors typically consist of tampered glass with an ornamental finish fastened to a hidden frame. They add sleek, modern, artistic, and ultra-luxury aesthetics to buildings. They are a stylish choice for restaurants and patios.</p> \n<h3>Glass-type</h3> \n<p>Glaciers, hammered, seeded, and frosted glasses are popular choices for decorative glass garage doors. A garage door with frosted glass panels obscures a garage\u2019s content, providing additional security while offering a unique modern look.</p> \n<p>Atinted glass garage doorkeeps out harsh daylight and serves as temperature control to the garage, depending on the degree of tint. A super black tinted glass garage door, for example, will also add plenty of privacy. There are also other colored custom glass garage doors used to achieve special effects.</p> \n<p>Homeowners and businesses who intend to glam up their spaces in an uber-chic fashion often opt for amirrored glass garage door. Mirror glass is a stylish option that depicts luxury. It allows maximum sunlight to enter the doored space while still offering privacy.</p> \n<p>Laminated glasses are known to block99%of UV light transmission and reduce noise. This is why a white laminate glass garage door is common in the hospitality industry. It is fairly flexible and hardly shatters when punctured.</p> \n<p>Tempered glass has a higher resistance to break and is easy to clean when correctly installed. And if it breaks, it does harmlessly. Thus, a tempered glass garage door is often used in schools and parks.</p> \n<p>Opaque glass garage doors keep offices, foyer rooms, and entry doorways out of the curiosity of peering eyes. An obscure glass garage door is similar to a tinted one, but it doesn\u2019t allow the passage of light and, thus, can\u2019t be seen through.</p> \n<p>Insulated glass garage doors maintain climate control and energy efficiency. They regulate the interior temperature and make the stay in a garage enjoyable. To that end, insulated all-glass garage doors are often used for doubling a garage utility as a home gym or a patio.</p> \n<h3>Installation and maintenance</h3> \n<p>Some doors can be installed via DIY processes, while the sophisticated designs require technicians\u2019 expertise. Similarly, people leading a busy lifestyle would prefer low-maintenance options as opposed to businesses that often have an in-house office cleaner.</p> \n<h3>Security level and energy efficiency</h3> \n<p>With energy-efficient doors such as residential insulated glass garage doors, energy bills can be reduced, and vital car parts can be well-protected. Similarly, a good glass garage door should offer the level of security needed. Remember, a warehouse would require greater security than a foyer room.</p> \n<h3>Cost</h3> \n<p>Contemporary aluminum glass garage doors prices range betweenUS$5,243 and US$12,585per 18 \u00d7 8 feet. Frameless glass garage doors prices can be as low as$97 per square meteror as high as US$120 per square meter. And a sectional glass garage door price can beUS$85-US$138 per square meter.</p> \n<h3>Brands, features, guarantees, and warranties</h3> \n<p>Everyone wants to buy from a reliable source. Some popular brands of quality glass garage doors are Clopay Avante, Wayne Dalton, C.H.I, Aluma, Envy Collection by Overhead Door, and Newton. When buying a glass garage door, remember to check if its features align with customers\u2019 expectations and meet their intended use cases. Also, it\u2019s always smarter to go for a brand that offers an extended warranty and has the best return policies.</p> \n<h2>Wrapping up</h2> \n<p>Now that more consumers are taking up woodworking, metalworking, and other DIY hobbies, all of which are primarily done in garages, the need to make the garages more conducive arises. The push for indoor planting as a part of the recentgarden trendshas also impacted the need for daylight-inviting glass garage doors in house interiors.</p> \n"}]}

Besides the heat and warmth, fireplaces also beautify and set an ambient mood in the home.</p> \n<p>But since there are different fireplace types and designs, it\u2019s best to choose the ideal options. This buying guide explores factors to consider when choosing a fireplace, types of fireplaces, and the advantages and disadvantages of each, thus facilitating decision-making.</p> \n<p>Before discussing these aspects, here\u2019s a peek into thee fireplace business for entrepreneurs.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe global fireplace market sizeTypes of fireplacesHow to choose an ideal fireplace</p> \n<h2>The global fireplace market size</h2> \n<p>The growth of the global fireplace market including fireplace screens and inserts is projected according to the type of fireplace. For instance, the hearth market is expected to rise from $9.3 billion in 2021 to $14.8 billion in 2027, growing at a compound annual rate(CAGR) of 7.7%.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the global fireplace electric heater market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5%, soaring to $2.77 billion in 2028 from $2.17 billion in 2021.</p> \n<p>This growth results from several factors, including:</p> \n<h2>Types of fireplaces</h2> \n<p>Fireplaces are categorized into three main types:electric, gas, and wood-burning. However, gas fireplaces use vented or ventless gas logs, depending on the fireplace setup.</p> \n<h3>Gas fireplace</h3> \n<p>Gas fireplacesgive the aesthetic feel and allure of the golden wood-burning fireplace. These variants are popular because they don\u2019t leave one with a cleaning hassle, as it doesn\u2019t have ash deposits.</p> \n<p>Gas fireplaces use gas logs- a burner with artificial wood-like design made from ceramic clay, ceramic fibres, or refractory cement. The logs can be used in a pre-existing fireplace hearth, thus reducing installation costs of old fireplaces.</p> \n<p>Most modern gas fireplaces allow for customization, like incorporating decorative glass or pebble options. And since they have a slimmer design, they can easily fit into tight spaces or in an existing firebox.</p> \n<p>However, before one settles for this fireplace type, it is essential to know the fuel source and whether they want ventless or vented.</p> \n<p>Ventless gas logs: As the name suggests,ventless gas logsdon\u2019t need a chimney to exhaust fumes. Also, these gas logs don\u2019t rely on vents to function, thus they are suitable for an old fireplace without a chimney.</p> \n<p>Typically, the ventless gas logs keep heat in the house. And since heat is efficiently utilized, ventless gas logs use less fuel.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, they don\u2019t look as appealing as vented logs, which may not be a problem for most people who value efficiency over appearance. Being ventless also means that this fireplace type isn\u2019t suitable for bedrooms.</p> \n<p>Vented gas logs:Vented gas logsare ideal for anyone needing a realistic-looking fire since they deliver large, yellow flames similar to flames from a wood-burning fireplace.</p> \n<p>Similar to wood-burning fireplaces, they create carbon monoxide. Therefore, they need a chimney to exhaust fumes. Also, vented gas logs consume more fuel and are less efficient than ventless ones.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h3>Electric fireplaces</h3> \n<p>Electric fireplacesact like wood or coal-burning fireplaces. They are the easiest hearth appliances customers can install in their homes.</p> \n<p>After all, many homeowners renovating their homes want to replace conventional fireplaces with built-in electric fireplaces.</p> \n<p>Electric fireplaces are powered when plugged into an electric source on the wall; therefore, no fumes are released in the house. And because it doesn\u2019t burn wood or gas, the modern electric fireplace heater is easy to clean and has low maintenance.</p> \n<p>Manufacturers of built-in electric fireplaces design them in various ways, thus making the fire look real. Furthermore, they are simple and safer to use than most fireplace types.</p> \n<p>Electric fireplaces are fitted with innovative LED light systems and highly configured mirrors to create a realistic illusion of real fire without the hassle and mess associated with a wood-burning fireplace.</p> \n<p>Electric fireplaces also have a unique feature that allows one to choose between enjoying a fire with or without heat. Since the flames from the electric place are simply reflected light, one can turn off the heating component, leaving the fireplace with beautiful dancing orange flames.</p> \n<p>However, the electric fireplace heater doesn\u2019t provide sufficient heat for big living spaces. In short, these fireplaces offer 4,500 BTUs of heat.</p> \n<p>Electric fireplace insertsare similar to gas log sets. They come in steel boxes that slide into an existing wood-burning fireplace.</p> \n<p>Homeowners or restrooms with unusable wood-burning hearths can buy electric fireplace inserts and bring their fireplaces to life. These inserts are low-cost and require minimal maintenance since no major structural change is needed on an existing fireplace.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h3>Wood-burning fireplace</h3> \n<p>Wood-burning fireplaceshave warmed homes for ages. Besides the heat, they provide a nostalgic and cozy ambiance with the typical smell of burning firewood.</p> \n<p>Although many people still love them, they have some drawbacks. For instance, burning wood produces carbon monoxide and toxins that could cause health issues. Further, a wood-burning fireplace is less efficient since a lot of heat is lost through the chimney.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h2>How to choose an ideal fireplace</h2> \n<p>The industry is full of various types and designs of fireplaces, making it challenging to choose the best fireplace to heat a home. However, here are factors worth considering before buying a fireplace.</p> \n<h3>Materials</h3> \n<p>A home\u2019s existing d\u00e9cor and finishes determine the material type one chooses when buying and installing a fireplace insert or a new fireplace.</p> \n<p>For instance, one can choose glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or cemented fireplaces depending on a room\u2019s theme.</p> \n<p>A wooden frame fireplace suits a home with classic and rustic d\u00e9cor, while a metal frame fireplace is ideal for modern rooms, giving them an industrial appearance.</p> \n<h3>British Thermal Units (BTUs)</h3> \n<p>BTUs are the primary measure of a fireplace\u2019s heat output. The amount of BTU needed from a fireplace depends on the room size. For instance, a small room of 200 square feet would need a fireplace that produces 6,000 BTUs, while larger rooms (1000 sq. ft.) may require a fireplace that emits about 30,000 BTUs.</p> \n<p>Other factors that affect the number of BTUs needed are the room\u2019s insulation mechanism and the nature of the room. So, highly insulated houses will require lower power output.</p> \n<h3>Fuel type</h3> \n<p>Before buying a fireplace, one should determine the best fuel type for their home. Those with a steady supply of wood may prefer wood-burning fireplaces, while those with easy access to a natural gas line or propane tank would do well with gas fireplaces.</p> \n<p>Wood-burning fireplaces also require spaces with good ventilation options and more clearance for safety.</p> \n<p>Additionally, one should consider the number of BTUs needed to heat the space properly. Therefore, consumers who want to heat a large home with high BTUs can opt for gas variants.</p> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<p>A new fireplace\u2019s price varies greatly depending on the type and features. They range from basic fireplaces to premium or luxurious units. The true cost of a fireplace goes beyond the initial purchase and installation price. Other costs include operating and maintenance costs.</p> \n<h3>Mounting options</h3> \n<p>Fireplaces have different mounting options depending on the design and functionality. For instance, a wall-mounted fireplace is ideal for a more traditional home with a surrounding mantel since it can sit in a built-in fireplace space.</p> \n<p>Afree-standing fireplaceis good for anyone who does not want to construct a specific place for a fire. It can be fixed to a wall or used as free-standing depending on the buyer\u2019s preference and the fuel used.</p> \n<p>A built-in fireplace insert can fit any home or room with an unused existing fireplace. It is the easiest way to convert a wood-burning fireplace to an electric or gas fireplace.</p> \n<h3>Location</h3> \n<p>The type and size of fireplace consumers buy determines its location. For instance, large fireplaces that emit more BTUs are required for installation at the center of the house. Wood-burning and gas fireplaces can work outdoors since they produce more heat than electric fireplaces.</p> \n<h2>In closing</h2> \n<p>Technology has revolutionized fireplaces, but even timeless wood-burning fireplaces still provide heat and aesthetic value. From gas to modern electric fireplaces, households and businesses can choose a design that suits their needs.</p> \n<p>However, before choosing an ideal fireplace type, one should evaluate the materials used, fuel type, location, BTUs, mounting options, and budget. Statistics show that fireplace markets will continue to grow, providing business opportunities for entrepreneurs.</p> \n"}]}

One of the most effective ways to achieve this is with a heated towel rail\u2014which can help consumers take showers without shivering near an icy radiator.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, sellers can leverage this market by running a heated towel rail business. However, they can\u2019t start without having a plan, otherwise, things may get tricky and lead to losses.</p> \n<p>This article will guide retailers on how to profit from the heating towel rail industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsConsiderations for a heated towel rail businessThree outstanding heated towel rails to stock up onHow big is the heated towel rail industry?Last words</p> \n<h2>Considerations for a heated towel rail business</h2> \n<h3>Electric vs hydronic</h3> \n<p>Heated towel rails can work via electricity or hydronics. Electric towel heaters are self-contained units that can work without assistance from a heating system. Usually, they host low-watt, electric elements (some feature dry elements) that heat wires installed in the tower rails. Alternatively, these types may have \u201cwet\u201d components heating water or oil inside towel tubes.</p> \n<p>Hydronic towel warmers often rely on radiant heating or hot-water plumbing systems. Similar to radiators, hot water runs through the bars to provide consistent warmth.</p> \n<p>Consumers looking for stand-alone heated towel rails will love electric variants, while hydronic models are ideal for those with cravings for connected systems.</p> \n<h3>Configuration type</h3> \n<p>Generally, businesses can consider three configuration types, including floor-mounted, wall-hung, and freestanding styles. Retailers may also stock up on all three plug-in electric or hardwired hydronic versions.</p> \n<p>Wall-mounted towel warmers will make appealing offers for consumers with space-constrained bathrooms. Customers with freestanding tubs can\u2019t go wrong with floor-mounted heated towel rails.</p> \n<p>Note: Sellers can capitalize on all configuration types to satisfy all consumer preferences.</p> \n<h3>Design type</h3> \n<p>Another thing to consider is the unit\u2019s design. Consumers may demand functionality, aesthetics, or both. Thankfully, there is no shortage of heated towel rail styles for various bathrooms.</p> \n<p>One unique style is the ladder-heated towel rail. Most consumers gravitate toward this design because of its classic and sleek look, which fits modern, minimalist, or traditional bathrooms.</p> \n<p>Retailers can offer a contemporary twist by opting for curved towel rails. This design strays away from the traditional ladder style and appeals to consumers searching for designer-worthy units to enhance their bathrooms\u2019 aesthetics.</p> \n<p>In Europe and the UK, where temperatures are usually colder than in North America, towel radiators are preferred to regular electric heated towel rails. In tropical countries with warmer temperatures, the normal heated towel rails are perfect for use.</p> \n<h3>Installation difficulty</h3> \n<p>Installation complexity also drives consumer demand for these heating units. The mounting style and heating source are two factors deciding how hard it will be to install them. Some models have simple plug-in mechanisms, while others need professional intervention to connect them to a home\u2019s electrical or plumbing system.</p> \n<p>Businesses must consider stocking up on easy-to-install variants, as most consumers don\u2019t like spending extra cash or going through complicated procedures. Freestanding towel heaters have the highest flexibility in installation and placement.</p> \n<h3>Construction materials</h3> \n<p>Durability is another critical factor to consider before purchasing heated towel rails. Always opt for units made with high-quality materials to offer more conductivity and lifespan. Chrome is the most widespread material for these heating units.</p> \n<p>Chrome heated towel rails are efficient, clean, durable, and bright. Alternatively, sellers can opt for stainless steel models, which appeal to consumers with more humid bathrooms. Stainless steel towel warmers are immune to rust and corrosion, making them sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.</p> \n<p>In addition, sellers can offer heated tower rails made from mild steel. They have impressive quality and will meet the needs of any consumer looking for sturdy tower warmers.</p> \n<h3>Finishing type</h3> \n<p>Heated towel rails with polished finishings can look stylish and sleek in any bathroom. However, they\u2019re ideal for consumers with smaller bathrooms because of their reflective surfaces. Polished towel warmers can add an elegant touch to otherwise plain bathing spaces.</p> \n<p>Colors like white and black also look fantastic as tower rail finishes. Items with white finishes will keep towels warm while brightening the bathing space. They are ideal for consumers with monochrome or minimalist-inspired bathrooms.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, black finishes make style statements when added to towel warmers. Businesses can offer items with this finishing to consumers looking to elevate modern bathrooms and add extra coziness.</p> \n<h3>The benefits of using heated towel rails</h3> \n<p>Most times, a product\u2019s benefits determine its profit potential. Thankfully, heated towel rails offer appealing benefits beyond spa sessions. In addition to draping consumers in warmth after a bath, these items can offer a variety of other advantages.</p> \n<p>Heated towel rails can double down as supplemental heaters in consumers\u2019 bathrooms by helping to supply ambient warmth\u2014which also counters mold-inducing dampness. In addition, this heating equipment can quicken the drying process for outerwear and delicate clothing.</p> \n<p>These products can keep towels fresh by drying them faster and preventing mildew. Businesses can head into the heated towel rail market armed with these benefits to make the most appealing offers.</p> \n<h2>Three outstanding heated towel rails to stock up on</h2> \n<h3>Central heating towel rails</h3> \n<p>Central heating towel railsrely on the consumer\u2019s heating system to function. Interestingly, they will remain on as long as the user\u2019s heating system is activated.</p> \n<p>Although it\u2019s an efficient and effortless way to keep towels warm,central heating towel railssell more during winter. In addition, they\u2019re not ideal for warmer climates as consumers will want warm towels without heating their entire house.</p> \n<h3>Electrically heated towel rails</h3> \n<p>Electric towel warmersdraw power from the user\u2019s main electricity source. Although they\u2019re electrically powered, these heated towel rails feature double insulation that makes them super safe.</p> \n<p>In addition,electrically heated towel railswill operate regardless of the consumer\u2019s central heating system, making them ideal for summer and spring. Users can easily control them with a switch connected to the radiator.</p> \n<h3>Dual fuel heated towel rail</h3> \n<p>Dual fuel towel railsoffer the best of both worlds. Consumers can power them through electricity or via their central heating system.</p> \n<p>Therefore, users can warm their towels alongside their homes in colder months or heat their bathrooms independently with thesetowel rails.</p> \n<h2>How big is the heated towel rail industry?</h2> \n<p>The worldheated towel rail industryreached a total value of $933.9 million in 2019.

Instead, consumers are likely to pick varying laptop stands depending on their needs and preferences. Bearing that in mind, here are six types of laptop stands with mass appeal.</p> \n<h3>Portable laptop stands</h3> \n<p>Nowadays, many workers don\u2019t work in just one place.

This article outlines everything businesses should consider when selecting the right rubber flooring.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsPotential of the rubber flooring industryFactors to consider when choosing rubber flooringConclusion</p> \n<h2>Potential of the rubber flooring industry</h2> \n<p>Globally, the resilient flooring market was valued atUSD 38.7 billion in 2020, and it is set to expand at a CAGR of 7.2% from 2021 to 2028. Over the forecast period, growing infrastructure projects and the desire to improve the aesthetics of buildings will drive the demand for resilient flooring.</p> \n<p>As a result of global restrictions, major global economies had suspended and delayed construction projects. This reduced the demand for resilient flooring products in residential and non-residential sectors. However, the market is expected to resume its growth trajectory in 2022 thanks to the ease of lockdowns.</p> \n<p>The U.S. market is expected to grow as more durable products become available, installation techniques become more convenient, and environmental demand grows. Additionally, construction solutions with high durability and low maintenance are anticipated to impact the market positively. These advantages and the affordability of this option guarantee that the demand for rubber flooring products will continue to grow.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when choosing rubber flooring</h2> \n<p>Businesses can benefit from the versatility and resilience of indoor- and outdoor-rubber flooring for many purposes.</p> \n<p>They can also reduce harmful emissions while reducing maintenance costs and creating a more comfortable workspace or living area for their staff and guests.</p> \n<p>Below are some factors to consider when choosing rubber flooring.</p> \n<h3>Types</h3> \n<p>Rubber flooringis available in three basic types: tiles, rolls, and mats. Businesses must consider the intended use and traffic expected to determine the best kind of rubber flooring material for their space.</p> \n<p>Tiles are the most popular and preferred choice among businesses because their convenient size and design make them suitable for any space and purpose. They are also ideal for outdoor use due to their resistance to the elements.</p> \n<p>For larger areas, businesses can opt for rubber roll flooring. It is the market\u2019s most economical rubber flooring option, as it creates fewer seams thaninterlocking rubber tiles.</p> \n<p>One or tworubber rollscan completely cover an entire room since they are 4 feet (or more) wide and up to 50 feet long. However, it can be challenging to install rubber flooring rolls due to their weight.</p> \n<p>Rubber mats are another popular choice for their versatility, affordability, and ease of installation. They are primarily designed for indoor use but can also be used outdoors.</p> \n<h3>Thickness and backing</h3> \n<p>The thickness of rubber flooring is also vital since it determines its durability and cost. Thicker backing is more expensive but more durable; thinner backing is cheaper but less durable.</p> \n<p>Additionally, thick materials will be softer underfoot and provide better comfort and sound absorption.</p> \n<p>Businesses should consider how much traffic the flooring is going to experience to estimate its durability.</p> \n<p>For instance, rubber floors meant for internal use should have a thickness of at least 1/2 inch, while outdoor floors should have a thickness of between 2 to 3 inches.</p> \n<p>Commercial facilities like gyms, fitness centers, or livestock stables will benefit from athicker rubber flooring matthat can withstand the rigors of everyday use without denting, fading, or cracking.</p> \n<h3>Surface options</h3> \n<p>When planning a rubber floor, businesses can choose not only from different formats and thicknesses but also from different textures and finishes.</p> \n<h3>Styles and designs</h3> \n<p>Several colors and styles of contemporary rubber flooring are available. Among them are patterns that mimicnatural wood and stoneand multidimensional effects that add visual interest to any room.</p> \n<p>The possibilities for designing and styling rubber products are endless, as manufacturers constantly print innovative, colorful patterns and designs onto rubber products.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, businesses can create custom color mixtures to match corporate colors and print their logo on the flooring with a water-jet cutting machine.</p> \n<p>With rubber flooring, businesses can let their imagination and creativity run wild. Rubber flooring can be laid to create repeat patterns or in a more random manner, giving corporations the freedom to create designs that add flair to rooms.</p> \n<p>For safety flooring, a more robust pattern is ideal because it prevents sliding. Using black rubber and commercial-grade adhesive is a reliable way to construct a durable, slip-resistant entryway.</p> \n<h3>Cost considerations</h3> \n<p>The upfront cost of buying rubber flooring is considerable. This is a factor to consider when planning a project but it is only part of the story of overall costs accounted for.</p> \n<p>Businesses should take note of the total cost of ownership, including installation costs, maintenance costs, and repair costs (especially if thenew rubber flooringis incompatible or will not adhere to the old floor).</p> \n<p>Businesses should compare the total cost of ownership among brands and find the right balance between price and quality that works best for their projects and business needs.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Rubber flooring has many advantages for residential and commercial spaces and it is a popular choice among property owners seeking a reliable and affordable floor covering solution.</p> \n<p>The growing popularity of this flooring stems from the increasing number of options available on the market and its versatility in residential and commercial settings.</p> \n<p>Businesses that want to install rubber flooring must consider factors such as cost, installation, thicknesses, types, styles, surface options, and maintenance before choosing.</p> \n"}]}

A lot of different mattresses are available on the market today. But despite being around for only a couple of decades, memory foam has become one of the most popular.</p> \n<p>How come? There are a couple of reasons, which you will learn all about here. This article covers all things memory foam, including what it is, how it is made, and why you may or may not need one.</p> \n<h2>What it is</h2> \n<p>Memory foam was invented in 1966 by NASA specifically for aircraft seats and seatbelts. It was purposefully created to protect astronauts from extreme impact upon takeoff and landing. Shortly after, memory foam started to pop up in different places such as cushioning in helmets and shoes, as well as in prosthetics and wheelchair seating pads.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t until 1991 that memory foam was used for mattresses. During that year, a company called Tempur World launched an innovative new product called the \u201cTempur-Pedic Swedish Mattress,\u201d a revolutionary mattress topper that molded itself around your body. This company still produces mattress toppers to this day.</p> \n<p>However, due to how difficult it was to produce the material at the time, memory foam was too expensive for the average consumer. It was recorded that Tempur World sold only 70 mattress toppers their entire first year in business. But as memory foam became easier to produce over time, it became significantly more affordable and began to make its way to bedrooms worldwide.</p> \n<h2>How it is made</h2> \n<p>The main component of memory foam is polyurethane, a versatile plastic polymer that is used in a wide range of materials and products such as furniture, liquid paints, spray foam, and even harder materials such as car parts and roller skate wheels. Memory foam is made by combining polyurethane and other chemicals, which vary based on each manufacturer\u2019s unique formulas.</p> \n<p>Memory foam is also called viscoelastic, which combines two concepts: viscosity and elasticity.</p> \n<p>When you combine these two properties, you get something that contours to the shape of your body, hugs your curves, and essentially makes you feel like you\u2019re lying on a fluffy cloud. And when you get up, it returns to its initial shape.</p> \n<h2>Pros of memory foam</h2> \n<p>Pressure point relief</p> \n<p>One of the biggest benefits of memory foam mattresses is that they help alleviate the pain generally associated with sleeping. Memory foam contours to the body by using pressure and body heat. This can provide relief in areas of the body where you put the most pressure on during sleep, such as the hips, shoulders, and neck.</p> \n<p>Memory foam relieves the pain and discomfort by taking the stress off of these common pressure points, therefore evenly distributing the pressure throughout the body. This makes memory foam especially helpful for people with joint pain or arthritis.</p> \n<p>Back support & spinal alignment</p> \n<p>Ideally, your spine should maintain a position when you\u2019re sleeping that is similar to when you\u2019re standing up. This is exactly what memory foams are designed to do. The contouring qualities of memory foam provide lumbar support, which allows the spine to maintain its neutral shape.</p> \n<p>To maximize the benefit of lumbar support and proper spinal alignment, make sure that the memory foam mattress you buy has the right foam density for your body. Foam density measures how much weight the foam can handle per cubic foot. As a general rule, the higher the foam density, the morefirm the mattressis.</p> \n<p>Low-density memory foam has a measurement of 3 lbs/ft3or lower, medium-density memory foam has a measurement of 4 to 5 lbs/ft3, while high-density memory foam measures 6 lbs/ft3or more. Each foam density will feel and respond differently. If you are unsure which foam density is right for you, it\u2019s suggested that you lay on different mattresses before making a purchase. Ideally, you want to buy a mattress that you feel most comfortable in.</p> \n<p>Suitability with all sleeping positions</p> \n<p>Memory foam\u2019s contouring properties make it suitable for all sleeping positions. If you are a side sleeper, memory foam gives you an extra layer of cushioning to protect your shoulders, hips, and ankles. If you are a back sleeper, memory foam gives you extra lumbar support to promote proper spinal alignment. Andif you prefer to sleep on your stomach, you are less likely tohave your lower back bow over the bed, making you less prone to back discomfort.</p> \n<p>Motion isolation</p> \n<p>Memory foam\u2019s viscoelastic material can absorb pressure and movement. Instead of causing the bed to bounce like spring or latex beds, memory foam keeps motion on one part of the bed from being felt across the entire surface. This is especially beneficial for couples and light sleepers.</p> \n<p>Durability</p> \n<p>Depending on the manufacturer and brand, a high-quality memory foam mattress can last up to ten years. Because the foam can bounce back to its original shape, these mattresses tend to have a longer lifespan. If you\u2019re looking for the best value for your money, mattresses with a higher foam density generally last longer before sagging.</p> \n<h2>Cons of memory foam</h2> \n<p>Heat</p> \n<p>Because the foam is made to retain heat, memory foam mattresses are known to be hotter than ordinary mattresses. In most cases, you will need to adjust your room temperature with a thermostat or air conditioner to avoid discomfort. With that said, more recent innovations in memory foam technology such as open-cell and gel foam are developed to help solve this problem.</p> \n<p>Weight</p> \n<p>Because of the foam\u2019s density, memory foam mattresses can be heavy and difficult to move. One person alone might not be able to set the mattress up, or lift it up to put sheets underneath. However, more and more products are being released and advertised as lighter memory foam mattresses. This is due to the fact that they only contain memory foam layers, which reduces the weight of the mattress in exchange for some durability.</p> \n<p>Water absorbing</p> \n<p>Memory foam is not waterproof. As such, it takes a bit of effort to clean a memory foam mattress after beverage spilling, excessive sweating, or other unwanted circumstances. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you protect your memory foam mattress with awaterproof mattress cover.</p> \n<p>Odor</p> \n<p>Some sleepers complain of an odor from their memory foam mattress. This problem occurs if the mattress is not cleaned and maintained properly, especially after years of use. Much like any other mattress, sweat and dirt are retained in memory foam materials.</p> \n<p>However, not all memory foam mattresses are created equal. This problem occurs less with higher-quality brands. Before you purchase a memory foam mattress, it is recommended that you check the customer reviews to spot any comments about this issue in particular.</p> \n<p>Price</p> \n<p>Memory foam mattresses are generally more expensive than ordinary mattresses. Top-quality mattresses such asTempur-Pediccan cost upwards of a thousand dollars. However, it\u2019s safe to say that the price of a memory foam mattress is generally an indication of its quality. A memory foam mattress may be more expensive than a regular mattress but it is better for your body and lasts longer.</p> \n<p>The good news is that memory foam mattresses are getting more affordable, as more manufacturers are coming out with new products and new ways to innovate this tried-and-tested technology.</p> \n<p>When looking for amemory foam mattress to buy, make sure to take into account your sleeping habits, room conditions, and personal preferences. This will help you decide which density, make, and brand of memory foam you need. More importantly, read the online reviews to see if a particular mattress ticks all the boxes in your list.</p> \n<p>When it comes to mattresses, memory foam products have some of the highest customer satisfaction rates across the board. Introducing a memory foam mattress into your bedroom will not only give you a good night\u2019s rest every night, but will also enhance your mood throughout the day.</p> \n"}]}

This is indeed the time when a fan, more specifically a sizable ceiling fan comes in handy for its working theory is completely in line with the nature of the airflow. It spins counterclockwise to generate a downdraft that pushes down therising warm air, thereby effectively circulating the airflow to the entire room or space evenly and quickly. Ceiling fans have evolved significantly since theirinvention in 1882, and ceiling fans with LED lights integrated are the most recent trend that has fully realized their capacity. Read on to see how this relates to business prospects for wholesalers!</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsMarket outlookPopular LED ceiling fans in 2022A breeze ahead</p> \n<h2>Market outlook</h2> \n<p>According to several worldwide market research, the ceiling fan industry is growing at a steady rate. In 2019, a compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 4.3% was estimatedfor the forecast period of 2019 to 2025. However, by 2021, this number jumped to aCAGR of 6.0%over the projection period of 2020 to 2027, and a value of 16.17 billion is predicted for 2027.</p> \n<p>Urbanization, lower costs on top of more innovative features, and functions are among the top reasons cited by various studies that drove the soaring sales of ceiling fans. Among these factors, fast economic progress in most tropical Asia-Pacific nations, which has resulted in improved power coverage and higher earnings, is seen as the major cause behind such substantial growth.</p> \n<h2>Popular LED ceiling fans in 2022</h2> \n<h3>Standard LED integrated ceiling fan</h3> \n<p>Most of the standard ceiling fans for home use come with 4 to 5 fan blades for a well-balanced relation between the circulated air volume and the ambient noise. And these traditional ceiling fans are designed in a way to best suit the standard ceiling height of 9 feet, which is the mostcommon and standard ceiling height for homesnowadays.</p> \n<p>In America, ceiling fans are a fixture in almost every household, and this fact is backed bya report from The Columbianas early as more than 10 years ago. Ceiling fans are popular as they are much more economical compared to air conditioners and still capable of creating similar chilling effects. Furthermore, most ceiling fans these days are built-in with lighting, a feature that simply provides more reasons to deploy them in homes.</p> \n<p>In fact, according to theAmerican Lighting Association (ALA), integrated, innovative lighting was the rationale why more homemakers picked ceiling fans when it comes to home furnishing, on top of their practical usage.</p> \n<p>And among all the lighting options,LED lightsstand out since they outperform most other traditional light bulbs in durability and energy efficiency. This is evident today, as LED integrated ceiling fans can be easily spotted with multiple styles. For example, an industrial-styleLED light integrated ceiling fan can come with standard 4-bladesor with a less common3-blades modewhile maintaining its industrial design nature.</p> \n<p>As shown in the picture above, a farmhouse-style LED integrated ceiling fan is another popular design that is well-received among consumers. In line with its design, it is normally suitable for larger rooms or spaces. Therefore, a52-inch blade span ceiling fan, which issuitable for room sizes around 225-400 square feet, is a pretty standard size for afarmhouse-style ceiling fan.</p> \n<p>And regardless of the design style, most ceiling fans with LED lights integrated nowadays also come with extra features such as remote controls, six-speed choices, and multiple lighting options including colors and brightness controls.</p> \n<h3>Smart enclosed ceiling fan with LED light</h3> \n<p>There are quite a few types of smart enclosed ceiling fans with LED lights available in the market. Thebladeless ceiling fanfirst introduced by Exhale Europeback in 2017, for example, is one of the most iconic enclosed LED ceiling fan designs and has gained popularity in Europe since its inception. This relatively newbladeless ceiling fan with LED lightingconcept opens up ceiling fan installation possibilities even in smaller rooms and low ceilings, which in the past were deemed too risky or unsafe for ceiling fan placements.</p> \n<p>Besides bladeless design, another common style of enclosed ceiling fans with LED lighting places more emphasis on decorative elements by making its blades \u201cinvisible\u201d instead. In most respects, an enclosed LED ceiling fan with invisible blades is quite similar to its bladeless counterpart, with the exception that, as can be seen in the image below, it often has smaller, transparent blades that are housed in a cage.</p> \n<p>Aesthetically speaking, an enclosed ceiling fan allows more designs around its cage, and hence it is easier to find designs or styles that can easily blend into any living room, kitchen,dining room, and bedroom. Meanwhile, fully enclosed or caged LED light ceiling fans are most suited for a kid\u2019s room, room with a bunk bed, or study room from a safety point of view.</p> \n<p>The versatility of most enclosed ceiling fans makes them a top ceiling fan choice for almost every home space, including a kids\u2019 area. Moreover, these ceiling fans not only come with LED lighting for energy saving but also come with asmart switch control and APP controls.</p> \n<h3>Retractable blades LED light integrated ceiling fan</h3> \n<p>While the usage of ceiling fans is most amplified during summer, they can actually be used for all seasons including winter and autumn. During cooler seasons, aceiling fan with a reversible motorcan rotate the ceiling fan clockwise instead of anticlockwise\u2014its usual spinning direction. This will do wonders for any ceiling fans to create an updraft that pulls the cold air upward and distributes the warm air from the ceiling to the ground area instead.</p> \n<p>And of course,retractable blades with LED light integrated ceiling fansare also available in the market to salvage the seemingly extra role of ceiling fans during the winter and autumn seasons.These ceiling fans with retractable bladescan keep the clean and clear look of any dining or living space throughout all seasons by having the blades fully retracted while maintaining their ornamental and lighting roles.</p> \n<p>The picture below provides a quick overview of the working logic behind a reversible fan during summer and winter:</p> \n<h2>A breeze ahead</h2> \n<p>Ceiling fans in this day and age serve not only the practical role of cooling people down but also being embodied with a new mission\u2014to be part of the decorative elements and a fashion fixture for most homemakers. That is why an LED light integrated ceiling fan can provide the most pragmatic functions regardless if it is a standard ceiling fan with LED light integrated, a smart enclosed LED lighting ceiling fan, or a retractable ceiling fan with LED light.

These lights can be used in residential, industrial, and commercial sites.</p> \n<p>In 2020, solar LED street lights had arevenueshare of more than 50%, so they dominated the market. Moreover, when it comes to thesolar LEDsused for gardening purposes, the overall demand is likely to experience a CAGR of 25% from 2021 to 2028. In addition, several smart city projects taken up by governments are endorsing solar street lights.</p> \n<p>The global outdoor solar LED market is expected to expand at aCAGR of 24.6%between 2021 and 2028. Consequently, leading global vendors seek to expand their product portfolio and production units across multiple regions in the years to come to gain a competitive edge in the market.</p> \n<h2>How do solar garden lights work?</h2> \n<p>Solar garden lights store power by taking energy from the sun and converting it into sustainably generated light when in operation later at night. One or two small photovoltaic cells on the top of each light absorb energy from the sun and convert it into stored electricity. During the daytime, this energy is used to charge batteries. Moreover, a photoresistor registers the lack of light after sunset and triggers the LED light to turn on. The energy stored in the battery is used to power the garden light without grid energy. It is noteworthy that solar garden lights usually last 12-15 hours on a full charge. Furthermore, eight hours of good sunlight are enough to charge a small solar garden light.</p> \n<p>Contrary to popular belief, planning and installing solar garden lights is easy. Each light is a standalone item; all you need to do is stick these lights in the ground according to where you need the most light in your garden in the evenings.</p> \n<p>In a typical yard solar light, all the working components are mounted in a single unit. There is a controller board, LED, and battery. When it comes to a solar yard light, the functionalities are pretty straightforward. One solar cell can produce a maximum of 0.45 volts of energy, but the amount of generated energy depends largely on the amount of light that strikes its surface and the size of the cell. Hence, you require four-cell wires in series in an archetypal solar yard light.</p> \n<h2>Best outdoor solar lights for the garden</h2> \n<h3>Solar pathway lights</h3> \n<p>These lights can be lined up to illuminate driveways, pathways, fields, and pastures.

More often than not, people looking for a new mattress are torn between buying aninnerspring mattressor amemory foam mattress.</p> \n<p>How are they different? More importantly, how do you know whichmattressis better for you? Keep reading to find out.</p> \n<h2>What is an innerspring mattress?</h2> \n<p>This type of mattress is the most traditional of all, as it has beenon the market the longest. The technology behind it dates back to 1871, and it is one of the most common types of mattresses today. Chances are, you have at least one of these in your home right now.</p> \n<p>Today, you will find many different types of innerspring mattresses. As a rule of thumb, the quality of an innerspring mattress can be determined based on the number of coils inside it. The number of coils and their placement inside the mattress contribute to how well it conforms to your body.</p> \n<p>In addition, it\u2019s also worth checking the coil gauge when buying a new innerspring mattress. The higher the coil gauge is, the thinner the wire and the softer the mattress feels. There is no \u201cmagic number\u201d when it comes to how many coils should be in a mattress. The best innerspring mattress largely depends on your personal preferences.</p> \n<h2>What are the different types of innerspring mattresses?</h2> \n<p>This is an important question to tackle as the type of coil has a huge impact not only on feel, but also on price.Continuous coils: These mattresses use a single wire forming an S-Shape with multiple coils to support the entire system. Since everything is made up of a single interlinked wire, mattresses with this type of coil are generally more durable than others. On the downside, because the internal structure is made of only one wire, there is little to no motion isolation. This means that you will feel the entire mattress move each time your partner changes his or her sleeping position. These are the most affordable spring mattresses.</p> \n<p>Bonnell coils: These coils are the first to have been invented and are still used in some of the most popular mattresses on the market. Shaped like an hourglass, these coils look like a helix when all put together. Mattresses with these coils tend to be more mid-range when it comes to price.</p> \n<p>Offset coils: Like Bonnell coils, offset coils are shaped like an hourglass as well. However, the main difference is that the edges on the top and bottom of the coils are flattened. This makes them more durable and quiet, and allows them to better support your weight.</p> \n<p>Pocketed coils (Marshall coil): This type of coil is often found in newer mattresses. Each coil is wrapped in fabric to improve contouring and motion isolation, which are two features that innerspring mattresses generally lack but memory foam mattresses are known for.</p> \n<p>On top of the type of springs, innerspring mattresses also vary in the foam, fabric, or upholstery they\u2019re created with.</p> \n<h2>What is a memory foam mattress?</h2> \n<p>Compared with an innerspring mattress, memory foam has a significantly more modern design. Memory foam was created in 1966 for NASA and was designed to protect astronauts from impact and turbulence during flight. Almost three decades after it was invented, manufacturers realized that this soft, malleable foam could also be used for mattresses.</p> \n<p>Just like innerspring mattresses, not all memory foam mattresses are built the same. Today, there are three main typesof memory foam mattresses:</p> \n<p>Traditional memory foam: This is the memory foam that first made it to the market in the 90s. While revolutionary, the main downside to using this foam for mattresses is that it absorbs and retains body heat. This can result in an unpleasant experience, especially when used in rooms with warmer temperatures.</p> \n<p>Open-cell memory foam: Even though open-cell memory foams are mostly made of the same material as traditional memory foams, this type of memory foam has a different internal structure. Inside the mattress are \u201copen cells\u201d, which are internal pockets that improve ventilation and air flow within the mattress. Memory foam mattresses of this type also tend to be less dense than traditional memory foam mattresses.</p> \n<p>Gel-infused memory foam: This is a combination of traditional memory foam and gel, where gel-based microbeads are injected into the foam. These microbeads create pockets similar to open cells. But instead of allowing air to pass through, these open cells absorb or release heat from your body due to the natural qualities of gel.</p> \n<p>When shopping for memory foam mattresses, always consider the density of the foam. Memory foam mattresses with a higher density will feel more rigid on your back, but also tend to last longer than mattresses with lower density.</p> \n<h2>What are the pros and cons of memory foam and innerspring mattresses?</h2> \n<p>Memory foam</p> \n<p>+ Good at relieving pressure</p> \n<p>+ Excellent contouring qualities</p> \n<p>+ Mattresses with higher densities can last for a long time</p> \n<p>+ No dust mites, mildew, or mold; great for people with allergies</p> \n<p>+ Excellent motion isolation; movement does not cause the mattress to bounce or move</p> \n<p>\u2013 Some users experience feeling \u201ctrapped\u201d by the mattress due to contouring qualities</p> \n<p>\u2013 Traditional memory foam absorbs and retains heat</p> \n<p>Innerspring</p> \n<p>+ Easier to move around and change positions at night</p> \n<p>+ No heat retention</p> \n<p>+ More manufacturers, variations, and price ranges</p> \n<p>+ Generally more affordable</p> \n<p>\u2013 Little to no motion isolation</p> \n<p>\u2013 Can be noisier due to the squeaking of springs</p> \n<p>\u2013 Little to no pressure relief; pressure is not evenly distributed throughout the body</p> \n<p>\u2013 More likely to sag faster than memory foam; shorter lifespan</p> \n<p>If you still cannot decide between the two after you read this article, you can consider getting a hybrid mattress. Hybrid mattresses are basically innerspring mattresses with a built-in memory foam topper. Typically more than 2\u201d in thickness, a hybrid mattress takes the features of both an innerspring mattress and memory foam mattress, and combines them into one.</p> \n"}]}

While Japan and Canada are forecast to grow at 4.2% and 7% respectively for 2020-2027.</p> \n<p>The signs point to a booming interior design industry. This is great news, but the businesses that will really stand out are those that innovate and capitalize on the new trends in the industry.</p> \n<h2>New materials for interior decoration in 2022</h2> \n<p>According to recentPew Research, more people are concerned about the environment, and how their choices may harm it, than in previous years. As a result, the design trends in recent years are shifting towards a conscious use of the planet\u2019s resources. The need to go green has led to the search for new eco-sustainable raw materials.</p> \n<p>In terms of interiors, people are looking to make the most of their space \u2014 as the new norm means spending more time indoors. In 2022, interior design trends will emphasize innovative, eco-friendly, and functional materials. Below are the trends for new materials for interior decoration this year:</p> \n<h3>Natural wood</h3> \n<p>With the desire to embrace eco-friendly materials comes the steady popularity of wood in interior design. It may be one of the most environmentally friendly materials for building homes or businesses.</p> \n<p>But on top of this, wood also possesses an incredible aesthetic quality, making it a popular choice for home decoration and interior design projects. It has applications in furniture in homes and offices, decorative accessories, and household products \u2013 such as toys,wood wall paneling, flooring, and other household items.</p> \n<p>Wood\u2019s versatility offers endless decorative options as different wood types and finishes can create warm tones or vibrant and modern styles. As a result, wood will continue to be one of the most popular interior design materials in 2022.</p> \n<h3>WPC</h3> \n<p>For a twist on wooden features, Wood-plastic composite, or WPC, has increasing appeal in the interior decoration industry. It combines natural wood fibers with synthetic fibers. The composite is made with sawdust, bamboo, peanut hulls, pulp, and woodworking waste, such as bark.</p> \n<p>A remarkable feature of this material is that it can be produced entirely from recycled materials. Even better, you can recycle old WPC to produce brand-new WPC, making WPC the ultimate recyclable material.</p> \n<p>In terms of application for interior design, the number of households installing and using plastic wood compositeflooringis increasing. It is also a highly sought-after material forwall cladding and panelsbecause of its flexibility and durability. Another advantage of using WPC for interior design is that it is easy to maintain.</p> \n<h3>PVC</h3> \n<p>PVC, or Polyvinyl chloride, is not the most environmentally-friendly material, taking 450 years to become fully biodegraded. Yet, PVC is still popular among interior designers and homeowners looking for a lightweight, durable, and versatile finish.</p> \n<p>PVC foam boardsare resistant to fire, water, and chemicals, including acids. They are also resistant to vibrations, noise, moths, and heat. The surfaces of the boards don\u2019t scratch easily, making them perfect for furniture, cabinetry, and interior design projects.</p> \n<p>And on an optimistic note, strides have been to make PVC more eco-friendly by eliminating Chlorine, a source of many concerns with PVC.</p> \n<h3>Fabric</h3> \n<p>From sofas to curtains to bedding and wall hangings, fabric is an almost universal material used in interior decoration projects. In 2022, this trend will continue as consumers increasingly embrace eco-conscious andeco-friendly optionsfor interior decoration projects.</p> \n<p>This trend is mainly due to technological advances that help designers createbeautiful fabricsusing eco-friendly fibers like bamboo or hemp that do not require chemical treatments or dyes.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, wall paneling is enjoying a resurgence in popularity, and fabric is popular with interior designers and homeowners looking for unique wall coverings.</p> \n<p>Fabric wall paneling allows you to add texture to the standard plain white or gray walling that homes typically offer. The innovation of wall panels with fabric backing has allowed designers the freedom to create stunning textured designs with vibrant colors to add depth and character to interior walls.</p> \n<h3>Bamboo</h3> \n<p>Bamboo is one of the fastest-growing plants on the planet. It is naturally sustainable and abundant in bamboo plantations across the world. Bamboo is naturally resistant to moisture damage and pests and is highly durable and abrasion-resistant.</p> \n<p>It is also flame-resistant and hypo-allergenic, making it an excellent choice for interior decoration projects. Also, it is available in natural tones, rustic and modern colors, and many shades of gray for interior d\u00e9cor projects.</p> \n<p>Bamboo can be used for flooring andwall panelingbut also to create furniture such as stylish chairs or couches. Because of these factors, bamboo is a material that will be highly sought after by the interior decoration industry in 2022 and beyond.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts on new materials for interior decoration in 2022</h2> \n<p>This year many people are looking for a change. One great way to embrace this is by sprucing up one\u2019s home, which can help improve well-being and mood.</p> \n<p>A growing interest in protecting the environment means consumers will turn to new materials that are more eco-friendly and naturally derived in 2022.</p> \n<p>As a result, businesses that embrace green materials will help people choose more responsibly and invest in quality products that will last them longer, as well as establish themselves well to capitalize on this growing trend.</p> \n"}]}

Keywords: New Arrivals"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<p>This article provides buyers with information about the interior decorating industry, including why sintering stone is popular and it is essential to invest in it. Scroll down to learn about sintered stones\u2019 benefits, uses, and cost and how they differ from natural stones. But first, let us examine the most recent developments in the tile industry.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsAn overview of the tile industryProperties and characteristics of sintered stoneWhy sintered stone is worth the hype</p> \n<h2>An overview of the tile industry</h2> \n<p>The tile industry was worth$207.7 billionin 2020 and is predicted to increase to $285.1 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 6.5 percent. The primary drivers of this industry include population expansion, increased investment in the residential and commercial sectors, increased interest in remodeling projects, and rising income levels.</p> \n<p>Sintered stone is a popular trend in the interior design market because of its adaptability, practicality, affordability, and beauty. It is made artificially utilizing innovative technology and natural materials to create durable, flexible slabs. The stone looks like any naturally occurring stone but is created faster, saving time and allowing manufacturers to customize the color, size, texture, and size.</p> \n<h2>Properties and characteristics of sintered stone</h2> \n<h3>What is sintered stone?</h3> \n<p>Sintered stoneis a slab made entirely of natural materials with the help of advanced technology. Other stones, such as quartz, are 88-95% natural stones, depending on the manufacturer, and are mixed with polymers, resins, and pigments to hold the slab together. Sintered stone is unique because it is not combined with other materials. This stone is made with advanced technology and closely resembles the natural stone-making process. While natural stones like granite and limestone take hundreds of years to form, these stones only take a few hours.</p> \n<p>Sintered stones are created by fusing high-quality natural stone particles and minerals that are carefully selected for texture and color. These materials are subjected to high temperatures and pressure, just as natural stone formation occurs deep within the earth\u2019s crust. This process is known as sintering and it is complete when all the particles are permanently fused without the use of additional bonding agents or resins. The finished product is a solid and durable slab that has many applications.</p> \n<h3>What is sintering?</h3> \n<p>Sintering is an artificial process that uses high temperatures to bind together natural materials without melting anything to form a firm slab. The process is similar to how the natural earth creates stones like marble deep beneath the crust. When making the slabs, the raw materials are fused under high pressures of up to 400 bars. They are then exposed to temperatures as high as 1200\u00baC, producing a solid and durable stone.</p> \n<p>The materials are chosen by the manufacturer based on the desired outcome of the product. They select natural materials and hand-pick the color and texture based on that. The manufacturer usually also decides based on the intended use, such as fireplace surfaces, kitchen countertops, flooring, or wall cladding. Although the thickness of thesintered stonevaries depending on the producer, the standard thickness is 12 mm. Some may be as thin as 3 mm for flooring, while others may be as thick as 20 mm for countertops.</p> \n<h3>How is sintered stone different from other stones?</h3> \n<p>Sintered vs. granite</p> \n<p>The main distinction is that sintered stone is manufactured artificially, whereas granite is naturally occurring. Because granite is natural, consumers have fewer options for color, pigmentation, and pattern than with sintered stone, which may be customized to meet specific needs. Granite must be sealed every six months since it is porous, whereas sintered stone is impermeable and does not require sealing. Granite is heavier than sintered stone, and thus installing it can be a challenge. Further, sintered stone has a high flexural structure, requiring less surface support and allowing for thinner countertops than granite.</p> \n<p>Sintered vs. quartz</p> \n<p>Sintered stone is composed entirely of natural components, whereas quartz contains natural and artificial substances such as binders and resins. One significant advantage of sintered stone is its excellent temperature resistance, as opposed to quartz, which can burn when subjected to heat.</p> \n<h3>Where is sintered stone used?</h3> \n<p>Sintered stone is highly versatile with a flawless finish, suitable for various applications.\u00a0 It is perfect for any application that makes use of natural stone. Depending on the manufacturer, it is designed for the following purposes:</p> \n<p>The stones come in various forms, including tiles for flooring and slabs for countertops. The majority of slabs made are large enough to meet residential and commercial needs. The only challenging aspect is size; if customers want a considerably large size, they may need to join the slabs together. Luckily, the consistency of the sintered slabs is superior to that of other traditional stones, so matching will not be a problem.</p> \n<h3>Benefits of sintered stones</h3> \n<p>Waterproof and stain-resistant</p> \n<p>Because stonewall panelingis waterproof and weatherproof, it is ideal for bathrooms, spas, and other damp areas. They are easy to clean and resistant to stains from hygiene products. These panels come in various sleek sizes and have quickly become a popular choice among interior designers because of their exotic and sophisticated appearance. Both full or half-length, sintered wall panels add a luxurious touch to any room.</p> \n<p>Unaffected by temperatures and easy to clean</p> \n<p>Sintered stone can endure high temperatures, allowing users to place hot plates and dishes directly on the surface without damaging it. They are scratch-proof, non-porous, and ideal for use as a kitchen worktop surface. This stone is created utilizing cutting-edge technologies while keeping modern requirements in mind. Sintered stone is especially useful in the kitchen since it is easy to clean, and surface marks can be removed easily without any abrasives.</p> \n<p>Durable and hard to scratch or damage</p> \n<p>Sintered stone is bonded together using modern technology to produce robust, long-lasting slabs. This stone contains qualities that ensure the surface will not alter. They are also UV and frost resistant, making them a perfect alternative for outdoor applications.\u00a0 In addition to being weatherproof, they are also lightweight and easy to install.</p> \n<h3>Cost of sintered stones</h3> \n<p>The cost ofsintered stoneis determined by square footage and varies according to size, color, shape, and design.\u00a0 On average, the price per square foot is $60 and will go up to $100 for installation. As a result, the cost can vary depending on the items needed for installation and the installer\u2019s fee. Consumers are not advised to install it themselves unless they are professionals in the field.</p> \n<p>The total cost will be around $3700 on average. The top end of this item may cost up to $5000, while the lower end will cost about $1000. One might think that this item is too expensive; however, most of these prices are comparable to quartz, so they should fit most budgets.</p> \n<h2>Why sintered stone is worth the hype</h2> \n<p>Sintered stone is the most recent product of modern innovation, designed to produce attractive slabs with a wide range of applications. These slabs are made entirely of natural materials and can be made in hours, as opposed to natural stones, which can take hundreds of years. Because they are artificial, manufacturers choose the color, texture, and size based on customers\u2019 needs. Given how manycustomers prefer productsthat are tailored to their specific needs, sintered stone is likely to remain popular.</p> \n<p>This artificial stone has several desirable properties: it is waterproof, weatherproof, scratchproof, resistant to extreme temperatures, highly flexible, and lighter than traditional tiles. It is used for kitchen countertops, table tops, wall paneling, and flooring. Due to its versatility and practicality, sintered stone will be a trendy item for a long time.</p> \n"}]}

With the ability to track how much REM a person has had, as well as to give massages and to adapt to an individual\u2019s body temperature, it\u2019s no surprise that demand for smart mattresses is on the rise.</p> \n<h2>The latest trends in smart mattresses</h2> \n<p>When it comes to smart mattresses, consumers\u2019 needs are strongly shaping the industry. The demand for mattresses that have different support levels and adjustable firmness, as well as for mattresses that have built-in massage functions, is growing steadily. On top of this, tech-savvy consumers may enjoy the sensory trackers and temperature regulators that are transforming the mattress industry and promoting better sleep and healthier lifestyles. With this in mind, here\u2019s a look at the top trends in smart mattresses.</p> \n<h3>Adjustable support levels</h3> \n<p>With traditional mattresses, what you see is what you get. But not everyone has the same requirements for a comfortable night\u2019s sleep, which is where smart mattresses come in. Some smart mattresses are designed with the ability to change theheight of the mattressas well as the shape, to better support the spine.

LED strips and their varied unique features are some of the best inventions in the industry. Lighting designers and architects incorporate LED strips into commercial, residential, and industrial projects since they are famous for their efficiency, brightness, color options, and ease of installation. Businesses and commercial building owners can use LED strips to light their business space to create the desired ambiance.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsThe future market analysis and insights for LED stripsFactors to consider when buying LED stripsTypes of LED strips</p> \n<h2>The future market analysis and insights for LED strips</h2> \n<p>The current global market size for strip LED is estimated to be $959.4 million and is projected to increase to $1843.6 million by 2028, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Developed economies like China, the US, and Europe hold the largest market share for strip LEDs.</p> \n<p>Flex LED strips are endowed with several configurations. The purchasing company can go for bright strips for illuminating the entire room or use less bright LED strips for accent lighting. They also come with different usable colors or wavelengths suitable for business and residential projects.</p> \n<p>LED strip sizes are described by a 4-digit number, such as 3014, 3528, 5050, or 2835. For instance, a 3528 chip size measures 3.5 mm wide by 2.8 mm tall; however, for the digitally addressable light strip, the four-digit number suggests the name of the LED controller chip and not the size of the chip.</p> \n<p>The strip LED market is propelled by the demand for energy-efficient, stylish, and flexible lighting for commercial and residential applications. The demand for low voltage LED strips isexpected to risebecause they are considered safe, reliable, long-lasting, easily controlled, cost-saving, and programmable.</p> \n<h2>Factors to consider when buying LED strips</h2> \n<p>Flex LED strips represent a huge industry with different unique LED strip lights. Businesses can choose one type over the other depending on how they want to use the lighting system. Below are some factors worth considering:</p> \n<h3>LED strip size or length</h3> \n<p>A business purchasing LED strip lights should consider how the LED\u2019s length fits with the perimeter of the room where they intend to install the lighting. One way to choose the right length is to measure the perimeter, nooks, and sections that stick out. Some rooms and LED strip lights are not the standard sizes, but the lights can be joined or connected and powered from one plug.</p> \n<p>Analyzing the size of an LED strip can be challenging because different manufacturers use different measurement units to explain it. MostLED lightstrip widths range from 8mm to 12mm, depending on the brand or manufacturer.</p> \n<p>Knowing various LED strip light widths is valuable during installation, especially when using aluminum extrusion or routing out a channel to ensure the strip fits properly. This knowledge is also important when adding an edge under the counter overhand, along with a desk, or inside a cabinet.</p> \n<p>Although it is commonly believed that larger strips perform better, this is not always the case. LED strip performance is dictated by several factors such as materials used, power consumed, and circuit design.</p> \n<h3>LED strip brightness</h3> \n<p>As lighting technology advances, LED strips also continue to improve their brightness. LED brightness is measured in lumens. The purchasing company should consider lumen per meter, foot, or reel. Different businesses can choose from the varied LED brightness levels depending on their desired look. Consider this buying guide for LED lumen by project type:</p> \n<p>Before purchasing an LED strip, it is good to evaluate its lumen output and consider if it fits the desired project.</p> \n<h3>The colors</h3> \n<p>Businesses can choose between monochromatic LED strips or a wide range of multi-color strips. The non-addressable, monochromatic strip light is cheap, easy to install, and suitable for situations that do not require pomp, like office buildings. However, the color-changing RGB strips are appropriate for businesses that need pomp and color display, like clubs. These color-changing strips with multi-colored LEDs allow businesses to change the lighting to suit specific occasions.</p> \n<h3>Waterproof</h3> \n<p>LED strip manufacturers employ technology to improve the versatility of their products. Today, some LEDs come suitable for outdoor installation with a protective coating to prevent water or dust from ruining the strip\u2019s electrical components. For example, theIP65 waterproof LED stripsare coated with a thin silicon layer to withstand outdoor elements.</p> \n<p>A residential construction company looking for patio lighting, outdoor lighting, lighting under the cabinet, and bathroom lighting can purchase waterproof LED strips. IP68 LED strips can function well even submerged in water or a hot environment; therefore, they are suitable for pool, steam room, or sauna installation.</p> \n<h3>Technological features</h3> \n<p>Some LED strips have advanced technological features such as Wi-Fi support, remote control, and voice control from Google Home and Alexa. These LED strip lights can enhance a building\u2019s illumination with easy operation.</p> \n<p>Club owners can install Wi-Fi LED strips controlled by a Samsung or iPhone smartphone from anywhere within the network. Furthermore, the Wi-Fi controller enables the multi-colored LED light to change colors with the beat of the music, making them ideal for party lighting. These LED strip lights can create a beautiful ambiance suitable for mood and accent lighting.</p> \n<p>Since some of these LED strip lights are programmable and come with remotes, they can light up in multiple styles and patterns. These LED strips can be programmed to give continuous flow lighting or decorative patterns depending on the occasion.</p> \n<h3>Ease of installation</h3> \n<p>Before a business purchases LED strips, it should determine where to install them and the respective ease of installation. LED strip lights are mostly easy to install since they have adhesive mounting clips to attach to the preferred surfaces. Unlike the regular bulbs that require the installation of a bulb socket, LED strip lights can stick anywhere, provided the surface is suitable.</p> \n<p>Since LED strip lights are versatile, they are suitable for accent light installation under the furniture, on the floor, ceiling, and behind walls. However, it is important to consider the length of the LED strips for easy installation. If the needed length is longer than the stated maximum, they should be installed parallel to the power source.</p> \n<p>The LED light strip provider should also allow the company to run a complete installation test to check the brightness and efficiency. Installation tests help purchasing companies verify the color temperature and troubleshoot any issues that could arise after purchase.</p> \n<h2>Types of LED strips</h2> \n<p>Since several LED strips of lights can be used for commercial and residential building decoration and lighting, making the right selection can be overwhelming, but this guide aims at making the decision easier. Here are some common types of LED strip lights.</p> \n<h3>AC LED flex strips</h3> \n<p>The custom length for each LED strip varies depending on the purchasing company\u2019s needs, ranging from 3 to 100 feet custom-made to suit the area of installation, but the maximum length run is 150 feet. The AC LED strip has varying numbers of LEDs and lumens per foot depending on color themes and manufacturer. For example, some warm-white AC LED strips have 145 lumens per foot, and cool-white ones have 180 lumens per foot.AC LED flex stripsare easy to install and can be used immediately after plugging in.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h3>DC LED flex strips</h3> \n<p>Most DIY projects use DC flex strip lights. With a 12-volt capacity,DC LED stripscan provide heightened aesthetic lighting functions wherever they are installed. The DC LED strip length depends on its voltage. Consider these voltage and length variations:</p> \n<p>The DC LED strip is smaller than the AC, with a 10-millimeter width and a 3-millimeter length. Since they are small in size and produce low heat, they are suitable for application in small spaces and places that can be touched.</p> \n<p>The 24V DC LED strip is a more versatile option for decorative, functional, and professional lighting. Depending on the IP levels and color displays, they can be used for outdoor or indoor installation.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h3>LED rope light</h3> \n<p>Unlike the flat AC and DC LED strips,LED rope lightis ribbon-like light encased with rubbery plastic, resembling a rope. Its casing is waterproof and bends in any direction, thus allowing omnidirectional installation. It can be installed in damp places to provide an aesthetic touch to the garden, deck, or room. It needs other bright lights to complement it since it has limited brightness.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h3>High output LED strip lights</h3> \n<p>High output 5050 LED stripsconsist of more inflexible strips mounted to a high-power source. These LED strips have a varied number of LEDs and lumens per foot that dictate their brightness. High-quality LED strips have at least 450 lumens per foot, providing light output equal to a traditional T8 fluorescent lamp. Their lighting is thrice the light output of regular LED light strips, making them suitable for special lighting purposes.</p> \n<p>High output LED strip lights are ideal for projects that need high brightness, like ceiling covers, skyline, and gardens. Though they need a 24VDC power supply, it is possible to set the power supply and dimming control on the strips to adjust their brightness.</p> \n<p>Pros</p> \n<p>Cons</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Although the LED strips market is full of lighting options, choosing the right product should not be challenging if the company knows what it is looking for. It should know its area of restrictions, colors, and power demands. The company should also consider ease of installation, size of the LED strip, waterproofness, and ingress protection when deciding on the LED strip to buy.</p> \n"}]}

Marble is a beautiful material to use for mosaic tiling and is growing in popularity in all corners of the household and non-residential spaces too.</p> \n<h3>Stone mosaics for a natural look</h3> \n<p>Stone mosaics, with their more natural and raw look, are in high demand with buyers. Stone mosaics are most often being used as either a wall aesthetic or as part of a backdrop. Backsplash tiles that are made of stone and are easy to apply, with a peel-off backing, are increasingly being produced to keep up with these demands. Natural stone is extremely durable, and with it being sourced from international locations such as Greece and Spain, there are patterns and stone types for everyone.

One of the major factors affecting productivity within an office environment is none other than office lighting.</p> \n<p>Bad lighting may haveseveral negative effectson the human body. It can lead to eye strain, headaches, and higher levels of fatigue. The lack of natural sunlight might even result in conditions like seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that comes and goes seasonally.</p> \n<p>Issues like that can be alleviated or even eradicated with good office lighting.

Power-efficient lighting would be suitable for consumers looking into reducing costs. By 2026, the LED lighting market is expected to reach $160.03 billion, and the size of the global smart lighting market is also projected to reach $38.68 billion.</p> \n<p>LED lighting has been popular since it is usually more efficient than traditional incandescent or fluorescent light bulbs.

It saves about33%of energy when pitted against fluorescent lighting. LED lights also have a longer service life and lower maintenance costs after installation.</p> \n<p>Another convenient lighting option for office spaces would be smart lighting. Controlling asmart ceiling lightfrom a phone makes everything so much more convenient. The issue of forgetting to switch off the lights would also be easily solved. Consider providing several different functions forsmart lightinglike voice control, being able to schedule when the lights switch on or off, being able to dim the lights, or a function to make the lights warmer or cooler.</p> \n<p>It has been found thatexposure to white light during the daycan help improve performance.

Acustomizable wall-mounted swivel spotlightmay tickle the fancy of independent brands with tinier offices.</p> \n<h3>Ambient and task lighting</h3> \n<p>As with all office spaces, the ceiling lights might cast dark shadows onto the workspace, making it less conducive. Task lighting is thus essential for a better-lit workspace. A portable, modern-lookingtable lampwill be a great option for tinier office spaces.</p> \n<p>Afoldable desk lampwith a wireless charging port would also be a great option.Multi-functional table lampsthat can double as music speakers and wireless chargers are bound to attract remote workers who want a highly-personalized workspace.</p> \n<p>There should be a balance between artificial and natural light in any workspace. For those with the luxury of space, ambient lighting can be provided through largerfloor lamps.

These lighting options can be installed at dedicated workstations in separate rooms or placed in a separate nook within a studio apartment. Ambient and task lighting works rather well for smaller spaces since items liketableor floor lamps are usually quite portable.</p> \n<h2>Provide a range of lighting options</h2> \n<p>With the number of lighting options available, what is suitable for each specific space is very much dependent on how the space is designed, whether it has natural light, and how one wants the overall look and feel of the workspace to be.

With the use of new technologies, vinyl flooring is being produced on a mass scale to keep up with growing demands. Consumers are looking for the latest colors, patterns, and textures to improve their homes or businesses, so new designs and materials are regularly being manufactured. Vinyl flooring is more durable and eco-friendly than traditional flooring materials as well\u2014two key reasons why more people are using it.</p> \n<p>In 2020, theglobal vinyl market industrywas valued at USD 30.61 billion, and by 2028 that number is projected to grow to USD 51.45 billion. Vinyl flooring is now the dominant material for floors in both households and businesses, and in recent years it\u2019s seen a big surge in usage. Vinyl flooring not only enhances the look of a room but also provides more features than wood or stone flooring. In the majority of cases, people wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize the difference between wood and vinyl flooring. That\u2019s how revolutionary it is.</p> \n<h2>Latest vinyl flooring trends in 2022</h2> \n<p>As technology develops, so too does the type of materials being used to create vinyl flooring. To keep up with the high demand, the vinyl flooring industry is constantly developing new patterns and textures for consumers as well. The latest vinyl flooring trends in 2022 are seeing an increase in eco-friendly materials being used, wood textures, and waterproof flooring as some of the most sought after features. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s currently trending in the industry.</p> \n<h3>Authentic-looking wood flooring</h3> \n<p>One of this year\u2019s biggest trends is authentic-looking wood flooring. This isn\u2019t a new concept, but its popularity comes down to a rise in the number of uniquewood finishesbeing produced. Today, consumers can choose between almost any type of wood, from distressed wood to hand-scraped finishes that help to make the vinyl flooring more realistic. Traditionally, wood flooring is difficult to maintain and is very unsustainable. Now people can get flooring that looks like any species from around the world and have it installed with minimal hassle. This type of vinyl flooring is only increasing in popularity as different styles and features are brought to the market, so it\u2019s here for the long run.</p> \n<h3>Waterproof flooring</h3> \n<p>A feature that\u2019s becoming increasingly common with vinyl flooring is waterproofing. Vinyl flooring has always been easier to maintain and clean than wood or stone, but it was only water-resistant and not waterproof. Today, manystyles of vinyl flooringcome with an air-tight locking system that blocks out water when it gets wet, such as by being mopped. Not only is the outer layer of the flooring waterproof, but the inner parts are also made of waterproof material. This allows for the pattern and color of the vinyl flooring to maintain its appearance over time. Waterproof vinyl flooring is becoming one of the most popular flooring types on the market today.</p> \n<h3>Patterns for everyone</h3> \n<p>A big positive when it comes to vinyl flooring is the number of patterns available on the market.Self-adhesive flooringcomes in a vast amount of colors, patterns, and textures, and if that wasn\u2019t a big enough selling point, it\u2019s also significantly easier to clean and softer to the touch than traditional flooring materials. Everything from authentic-looking wood, stone, and tiles is available when it comes to vinyl flooring. They have the same visual effect as the raw materials but are much more cost-effective and lighter in weight. The number of styles on the market today is endless, and with more hitting the shelves on a regular basis, there are plenty of options for people out there with any kind of budget.</p> \n<h3>Luxury vinyl tiles (LVT)</h3> \n<p>Recently there\u2019s been a big spike in demand forluxury vinyl tiles(LVT). The quality of this flooring means that it can stay intact for a much longer period than other similar flooring types, which cuts down on cost as well as environmental impact. This type of flooring is water and slip-resistant, making it a low-maintenance and easy to clean material. LVT has a shock-absorbent and cushion property that often isn\u2019t found in other types of vinyl flooring, which is why it\u2019s so popular in both commercial and home spaces. LVT is one of the biggest vinyl flooring trends in 2022 and is expected to increase in demand over the next few years.</p> \n<h3>Stone plastic composite (SPC)</h3> \n<p>The vinyl flooring industry is seeing a big demand forstone plastic composite(SPC) recently. There are many benefits to SPC flooring that aren\u2019t seen with other materials. SPC has a core mostly built up of limestone, which provides a waterproof feature as well as more stability underfoot. The integrated click system makes it incredibly simple to install, and it\u2019s seen as a low maintenance flooring type too. The fact that it\u2019s made without harmful chemicals, therefore adding to better air quality in the space it\u2019s installed in, only helps to boost the appeal of SPC to consumers. This sustainable and long-lasting type of vinyl flooring, with its endless patterns, colors, and textures, is sure to grow in popularity\u2014and fast.</p> \n<h2>How vinyl flooring is changing the design world</h2> \n<p>Vinyl flooring has been on the rise for some time now and is part of an evolution of flooring that started with wood, moved to laminate, and is now seeing vinyl as the dominant material. While both LVT and SPC flooring are becoming popular, there\u2019s also a high demand for waterproof flooring, authentic-looking wood flooring, and vinyl flooring with unique patterns and textures. With the extensive amount of designs currently available and more being manufactured regularly, the demand for vinyl flooring is set to increase as people look to enjoy a more sustainable and low-maintenance lifestyle.</p> \n"}]}

But choosing a brand-new look isn\u2019t always easy. There are so many factors to consider, including the size of the room, fixtures, and flooring materials. And, of course, we can\u2019t forget about the budget.</p> \n<p>A bathroom is meant to be a retreat, regardless of the amount of space available. So, let\u2019s look at some bathroom makeover ideas and tips for interior designers to inspire home improvement projects.</p> \n<h2>1. Japandi style bathroom</h2> \n<p>In this interior design style, Japanese minimalism merges with Scandinavian functionality. Japandi bathrooms combine the best bits of both styles into the perfect blend of form and function. Here are some japandi style elements to incorporate into a bathroom.</p> \n<p>Use natural materials like stone and wood to introduce different textures to the room. Focus on using intentional and functional items.</p> \n<h2>2. Vintage accents</h2> \n<p>Accent pieces often add great decorative elements to a home. They don\u2019t even have to boast a practical or utilitarian purpose as long as they draw the eye and add drama to a bathroom space. Incorporating vintage accents into a modern, clean-lined bathroom adds a bit of flair to the room, plus helps create artful yet cozy moments.</p> \n<p>Vintage light fixtures, mirrors, and hardware in deep, rich colors will make a bathroom exude warmth and transform it into a sanctuary.</p> \n<h2>3. All-in-one shower & bath</h2> \n<p>Now, worry not. This isn\u2019t the traditional walk-in shower and tub combo. Rather than a cramped tub featuring a rain head plus shower curtains, try to combine the two bathroom essentials without having to compromise on style. Swap out the curtains for sliding glass or swinging door enclosure to expose the beautiful tile work.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s no limit to the choice when it comes to faucets. With motion sensors, mixer taps, or vintage designs, replacing the faucet in a bathroom is a good way to change the feel.</p> \n<p>Homeowners are moving away from stainless silver tomatte blackor vibrant copper. Matching faucets can be used throughout the bathrooms in the house to create a cohesive vibe, or each bathroom can be themed with faucets matching the feel of the house.</p> \n<p>As for the tub and shower, combine them or have them in the same space but separate if there\u2019s space. The all-in-one shower and bath is an excellent option for homeowners who enjoy maximizing practicality and convenience.</p> \n<h2>4. Merge a bathroom with the outdoors</h2> \n<p>Here\u2019s a great idea for a master bath. Blurring the lines between the indoors and outdoors is hardly a new concept in interior design. However, few homeowners have indulged in the luxury of merging their bathrooms with the outdoors.</p> \n<p>Bring an outdoor feel to a bathroom by replacing one of the walls with sliding glass doors. If there\u2019s a need for privacy, consider installing a skylight to bring in natural light and improve ventilation. Replace the top half of the walls with long windows or simply bring the bathroom outdoors by making part of the garden or porch more private.</p> \n<p>Vanities and customized sinks are set to soar in 2022. Whether homeowners opt forwood designs, marble, or thermally treated laminate, the drawers act as a fantastic organization tool, where extra towels can be stored, or cosmetics and toiletries.</p> \n<h2>5. Spa-like features</h2> \n<p>Free-standing smart appliances are set to reach homeowners in 2022. Fromwall-hung toiletsthat self-clean to freestanding baths, true freedom comes from placing fixtures wherever the mood strikes.</p> \n<p>Adding natural elements like plants or pampas grass can create a calming spa-like atmosphere, allowing a homeowner to relax and destress. For deeper, richer colors in bathrooms, having a slab of rich malachite green marble as an accent piece can work some calming magic just as well.</p> \n<p>But for a small bathroom, it\u2019s best to expand the space by painting the walls white and mixing them up with blue tiles to give the bathroom a stylish, watery feel.</p> \n<h2>6. Be bold with color and accent pieces</h2> \n<p>Forget minimalism and basic beige; this bathroom d\u00e9cor style is the polar opposite of japandi. Colored ceramics andbrasswareallow for braver, bolder design choices, while patterned tiles add depth and texture to a bathroom. Whether it\u2019s hot pink, lime green, or matte black, using loud and bold bathroom tiles can help make a big statement in the house. Let\u2019s face it; there\u2019s something quite exotic about maximalism.</p> \n<p>Use big swaths of color, fish scale tiles, and large-scale patterns to bring the ideal bathroom to life. For instance, an eclectic blend of red and white tiles can be as chic as it is unique. Going big and bold is a great way to turn a bathroom into a luxury retreat.</p> \n<h2>7. Create contrast and highlight storage space</h2> \n<p>Sometimes less is more. Clean and cohesive tile placements are a fantastic choice for smaller bathrooms as there isn\u2019t much space to work with. Match bold brass accents with traditional white subway tile to create a beautiful bathroom. For a light and airy space, go for ultra-thin grout lines and a bright white color palette.</p> \n<p>For extra storage, add bathroom mirror shelf units with cut-out side panels for a contemporary twist. Awall-hung sinkis yet another stylish update that can help match or contrast other bathroom fixtures. Highlighting a wall or cabinetry by painting them a different color can transform an otherwise dull bathroom by giving it a modern glam feel.</p> \n<h2>Make a striking statement</h2> \n<p>Use these renovation ideas to transform a bathroom into a room of escape. The Japandi trend can help create an indulgent spa-like bathroom complete with double vanity, luxurious bath, and high-performance showers.</p> \n<p>But clean lines and a minimalism-inspired aesthetic don\u2019t quite work for everyone. If neutral colors and white paint aren\u2019t an option, don\u2019t hesitate to go loud and bold. A bold bathroom can make a striking statement and still be as calm and comforting as a spa-inspired bathroom.</p> \n"}]}

In view of these factors, the following is a list of diverse mattresses that are steadily gaining popularity.</p> \n<h2>Four major mattress trends that have swept the industry</h2> \n<p>Due to the growing demand and the expansive nature of the global mattress market, major players are offering fully personalized mattresses that cater to every requirement of the consumer. The options are endless, from shapes to sizes to customizable designs that are tailored to fit a distinctvariety of beds.</p> \n<h3>Smart mattresses</h3> \n<p>Mattresses are no exception to the rising demand for smart products.

For instance, one may come with a built-in music system or alarm while others may offer temperature control. These advanced mattresses are likely to attract consumers in the future, changing the landscape of the mattress space.</p> \n<h3>Organic and sustainable mattresses</h3> \n<p>As people become more aware of the negative effects of synthetic and chemical products used in traditional mattresses, there is a growing trend toward eco-friendly products worldwide. According to a survey byDeloitte, consumers are more likely to purchase products that promote sustainability. In 2022, manufacturers will challenge the outdated mattress industry by providing organic and eco-friendly products that are better for health and the environment.</p> \n<p>Previously, these products were made from synthetic materials.

Some customers love the idea of being able to choose the mattress\u2019s material, firmness, size, and texture.</p> \n<p>Based on current trends, customized mattresses will continue to grow and most brands will be forced to adopt this concept. Also, it is hard to find the perfectmattress sizethat accommodates one\u2019s space and taste.

Almost all the top brands use this material to create long-lasting, high-quality mattresses. Due to their viscoelastic composition, they have grown in popularity. When users lie down, the material molds to their body but quickly returns to its original shape when they stand up.</p> \n<h3>Pressure relief mattresses</h3> \n<p>At aCAGR of 5.20%, the global market for pressure relief mattresses is expected to reach $2.7 billion by 2030. These mattresses provide significant relief for a variety of conditions, such as ulcers, bedsores, and skin sores. They are specially designed to treat a variety of medical conditions by dispersing pressure using air cells and a foam mattress. Pressure relief mattresses are one of the various support tools used to de-stress the muscles and tissues. They are widely used in hospitals and other medical centers.</p> \n<p>Pressure relief mattresseshave grown in popularity because of rising obesity concerns, a growing need for specialized mattresses in the health care industry, and an increase in demand from the elderly population. Other issues, such as poor blood circulation and sleeping disorders, have prompted people to look into such mattresses. With a rapidly growing elderly population, the demand for advanced mattresses such as kinetic and air therapy options has increased.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts</h2> \n<p>People are placing greater emphasis on their health, including sleep, as society becomes more health-conscious. They are always on the lookout for products that will help them sleep better and get the most rest. New trends are emerging because of the combination of comfort and technology with a market that is more lucrative than ever before. It is therefore critical to investigate trends and quickly adapt to the changing industry.</p> \n<p>With the changing landscape and the growing popularity of working from home, individuals have prioritized comfort over everything else. Customers want high-quality products that promote their health. Having organic and sustainable options is also beneficial.</p> \n<p>According to several market trendreports, smart mattresses are here to stay and will only grow in popularity.

Thus, it is important to listen to the demands of consumers and provide excellent alternatives.</p> \n"}]}

It had a market share of$75.8 billionin 2020, expected to grow to $160.03 billion by 2026. This is because LED panel lights are replacing traditional fluorescent ceiling lights throughout commercial and residential buildings in many countries.</p> \n<p>Choosing suitable panel lights to sell will attract buyers, so stocking appropriate ones is a wise choice. This article will help by explaining the popularity ofLED panel lights, examining LED panel light features, and revealing how to select relevant products.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsWhy LED panel lights are popular in homes and businessesTypes of LED panel lightsFeatures of LED panel lightsHow to choose LED panel lights appealing to buyersWhat\u2019s next?</p> \n<h2>Why LED panel lights are popular in homes and businesses</h2> \n<p>There is demand for LED panel light fixtures in many regions, with high growth in North America and South Asia. Between 2015 and 2020, estimated LED penetration in the lighting market increased from18% to 61%. LEDs are cheaper to manufacture, and more consumers desire sustainable lighting with lower energy costs.</p> \n<p>There are also other drivers of LED panel light adoption. Advancing LED light technology has led to interest from the commercial sector. This includes schools, hospitals, stores, and offices. Speed of installation and instant starts are additional drivers of demand.</p> \n<h2>Types of LED panel lights</h2> \n<h3>Size</h3> \n<p>LED panel lights come in 4 typical sizes, which are 60cm x 60cm, 30cm x 120cm, 60cm x 120cm, and 30cm x 150cm. Each size has a different applications. 60cm x 60cm ceiling lights are appropriate for offices while 30cm x 120cm LED lights are better for meeting rooms.</p> \n<p>There is a higher demand forconventional LED panel lightsizes. These include 60cm x 60cm and 30cm x 120cm. The size determines where the lights are suitable for. These include locations likehome offices, conference rooms, and canteens.</p> \n<h3>Installation method</h3> \n<p>Buyers can install LED lighting panels in many ways, depending on their purpose. Three different installation methods are used for suspended, surface-mounted, and recessed LED light panels. Suspended flat LED light panel installation involves cables that hang from ceiling mounts. Surface-mounted LED panel installation requires mounting kits, while recessed LED light panel installation ensures the lights don\u2019t protrude.</p> \n<p>Recessed lighting often gets chosen in residential settings like kitchens, closets, and living rooms.Surface-mounted lightingcreates better lighting conditions in office blocks and has manyadvantages. These include having a modern look and a uniform light output. Suspended panel lighting also has industrial applications, like warehouses and shopping malls. But suspended and surface-mounted panels don\u2019t look as sleek as recessed panels.</p> \n<h2>Features of LED panel lights</h2> \n<h3>Lighting source</h3> \n<p>LEDs on panel lights are in one of two places. This determines how the light gets emitted, guided, and diffused by the light panels.Edge-litLED light panels have LEDs on the frame\u2019s edge, and light gets emitted sideways. It\u2019s then dispersed using a light guide plate. Back-lit LED light panels feature LEDs on the back of the frame, with no need for a guide plate.</p> \n<p>Edge-lit LED panel lights and back-lit LED light panels have similar demand levels. Themain differenceis the absence of a guide plate on back-lit panels, increasing energy efficiency and reducing costs. Some edge-lit panels degrade over time depending on the guide plate material.</p> \n<h3>Color temperature</h3> \n<p>Residential and commercial buyers prefer different color temperatures. Wholesalers can appeal to different buyer categories using the K rating.</p> \n<p>2700K LED lights get associated with intimate, cozy, and personal settings. These include living rooms, bedrooms, and restaurants. 3000K LEDs get perceived as warm and calming and get used forbathroomsand kitchens. 3500K LED panel lights provide a balanced, friendly, and inviting look. This makes them suitable for office space, and retail stores. 4100K panel lights create a precise, clean, and focused appearance. This makes them appropriate for garages and grocery stores.</p> \n<p>Commercial demand for LED panel lights has grown. This means wholesalers can expectcool white LED lightsto become more prevalent this year.</p> \n<h2>How to choose LED panel lights appealing to buyers</h2> \n<p>Buyers of LED panel lights vary depending on the space available and the purpose of lighting.Home environments are suitable for warm lights. Office and hospital environments are appropriate for cool lights.</p> \n<p>Edge-lit andback-lit LED lightsare similar, but the lack of a guide plate on back-lit lights improves energy efficiency. This makes them suitable for positioning toward buyers with a focus on sustainability. Because both types are in demand, it\u2019s sensible to provide a mixture of edge-lit and back-lit LED lights.</p> \n<p>Buyers preferring recessed installations are likely to be residential buyers. Buyers of surface-mounted or suspended panel lights will have commercial or industrial interests. In any case, LED panel light size is relevant to all target buyers. A reliable approach is to select LED panel lights in the two most in-demand sizes covered earlier in the article.</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s next?</h2> \n<p>LED panel lights are helpful in many contexts, including residential, commercial, and industrial. Their versatility stems from the various available installation methods, sizes, color temperatures, and lighting sources. As the world advances, there is a growing demand for LED panel lights for various purposes. Examples include retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and interior design.</p> \n<p>LED panel lights form a growing segment of the lighting market. It\u2019s wise to capitalize on this trend by stocking LED panel lights for customers to choose from. The LED panel light market is also projected to grow in the years ahead, meaning sales figures should rise over time.</p> \n"}]}

But today, with some of the world\u2019s top architects getting into the game, this is no longer the case. There has been a boom of creativity and innovation in the prefab housing industry, and the benefits of this spill over to prospective buyers.</p> \n<p>Besides offering a variety of appealing designs, prefab, or \u2018modular\u2019 homes as they\u2019re sometimes called, are faster to build, and tend to come at a lower price tag. This competitive edge owes a lot to how they are made, with much of the process happening in a factory setting. This gives architects access to novel methods of production that allow them a wider range of design possibilities.</p> \n<p>With housing frames being constructed off-site, designers can capitalize on new technologies such as 3-D printing, while the modular construction process allows designers to combine aspects of conventional home design and layout with industry innovations in production that wouldn\u2019t be feasible for on-site construction.</p> \n<p>This factory-controlled production process also results in less waste, and allows for better construction oversight, which means they can be reproduced consistently and affordably at scale. Also, with the initial construction of prefab homes taking place under strictly controlled plant conditions, prefab homes can be built to the same codes and standards as traditionally built homes. The result is that prefab homes are not only more affordable than traditional homes, but they\u2019re often better looking, and typically more sustainable, without any compromise on quality or safety.</p> \n<h2>The evolution of prefab homes</h2> \n<p>Although mobile homes are also built in factories, and so are technically also a type of prefab home, they were distinguished from modern prefab homes in 1976 when the prefab housing industry saw increased oversight and regulation.</p> \n<p>Today, these new building codes and standards have given rise to a whole new era of beautiful, structurally sound manufactured homes that useeco-friendly materialsto blend in with their environments.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that even though construction takes place in a factory, prefab homes are typically built according to the state and local building codes where the house will be built. Coming in customizablepackage options, prefab homes are able to match not only the quality of traditional houses, but also the diverse regulation standards.</p> \n<p>For a list of the advantages of prefab homes, it\u2019s worth considering that:</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 They are greener than conventional homes because they generate less waste, reducing the demand for raw materials and the amount of energy used in the production process.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 They also have better energy efficiency overall, allowing homeowners to reduce their utility bills and carbon footprint.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 They offer improved air quality in homes because fabrication takes place in factory-controlled settings, limiting the potential concern of high moisture retention in the walls.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 They are budget-friendly because prefab companies can standardize production processes resulting in more affordable homes and a more straightforward building process for new homes.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 They offer a faster construction schedule because homes can be completed to code and using the same conventional materials in just half the time. For investors, this means that buildings can be occupied sooner, resulting in a faster return on investment.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 There are limitless design opportunities that can be customized to various tastes, or to fit in with the aesthetics of homeowner association requirements.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 Once assembled, prefab homes are virtually indistinguishable from their more traditional counterparts.</p> \n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 And finally, prefabrication allows for a safer construction process reducing the risks of accidents and related liabilities for workers and homeowners.</p> \n<h2>Different types of prefab homes on the market</h2> \n<p>Prefab homes come in four major categories: manufactured, kit, modular, and shipping container homes.</p> \n<h3>1. Manufactured homes</h3> \n<p>Manufactured homes are made up of panels \u2013 a whole wall, for instance \u2013 that are then assembled by professionals, often with the use of heavy machinery, on-site. It\u2019s for this reason that they\u2019re also referred to as panelized homes. Since these houses are pieced together on-site, they require quite a bit of finishing work, such as painting and installation of flooring, cabinetry, and stairs.</p> \n<h3>2. Kit homes</h3> \n<p>Kit, or pre-cut homes, follow a similar build to manufactured homes but feature simpler designs, such as log cabin kits or dome homes. They\u2019re designed for motivated homeowners who\u2019d like to DIY the assembly process using the materials and instructions supplied by the manufacturer.</p> \n<p>The significant difference between kit and other prefab homes is that kit homes are typically less complicated to assemble. These homes are cut to design specs in-factory, and fit together much like a puzzle.</p> \n<h3>3. Modular homes</h3> \n<p>These are prefab homeswhere one or more modules are built in a factory. These homes feature much more personalization. This customization means there\u2019s little finishing work to be done on-site as each module comes fully outfitted with interior fittings from plumbing and electrical wiring tocloset doorsand stairs. Modular homes differ from kit and manufactured homes in that they have an immovable foundation.</p> \n<p>Modular homes can be designed for larger upscale housing developments thanks tostacking and multistory options. These allow designers to take advantage of height to create open living spaces. Modular prefab houses can also come custom with upgrades such as hardwood floors and marble countertops.</p> \n<h3>4. Shipping container homes</h3> \n<p>Thesehomes are exactly what they sound like: homes made from steel shipping containers. Because of their versatility, shipping container homes have become popular, and are used by architects to create beautiful homes that really stand out.</p> \n<p>Contrary to how it may seem, it\u2019s relatively easy to execute a shipping container home from design to construction on site. Also, there\u2019s no limit to the form shipping container homes will take as they can be stacked together creatively, just like Lego bricks.</p> \n<p>Container homes often come built with simple materials and minimalist designs. Skylights can be used to allow light to stream in from above, and paired withLarge windowsthey can create a bright atmosphere indoors.</p> \n<h2>How to find the best prefab home</h2> \n<p>In order to make the best possible choice when choosing a prefab home, always pay close attention to what is and isn\u2019t included in the overall housing package. This is because different companies have diverse features and fixtures in their home designs. Modular homes, for instance, can come with a full package of fixtures, including windows, flooring, and cabinetry. Kit homes, on the other hand, may come with just the necessary framing components, such as the walls and a roof.</p> \n<p>Also, it\u2019s important to understand that the base price of a prefab home doesn\u2019t include features such as the foundation of the house, landscaping, and driveways.</p> \n"}]}

Full-sized beds, also known as \u201cdouble beds\u201d, are a little bit smaller than the queen. These different sizes provide different solutions for each individual, depending on their needs.</p> \n<p>So, whichmattresssize is best for you?\u00a0This article will break down the pros and cons of each size, and the key factors\u00a0that\u00a0should be taken into consideration\u00a0when purchasing a mattress.</p> \n<h2>Queen vs. full-size mattress comparison</h2> \n<p>First, let\u2019s have a quick look at their main differences. Below is a comparison chart\u00a0to provide\u00a0a more comprehensive understanding.</p> \n<p>At 54 x 75 inches,\u00a0a full-size mattress\u00a0is a great option\u00a0for single adults who want more space than\u00a0a\u00a0twin bed\u00a0or those that live in a smaller\u00a0room. They are the best option for\u00a0anyone looking to furnish a guestroom. Although they are commonly referred to\u00a0as\u00a0\u201cdouble beds,\u201d\u00a0full mattresses generally cannot comfortably fit most couples.\u00a0There is limited\u00a0space for two people to sprawl\u00a0or turn around in bed. Therefore, anyone\u00a0looking for a mattress intended for two people should\u00a0opt for the queen size. The queen size is\u00a06\u00a0inches\u00a0wider and 5\u00a0inches\u00a0longer than a full mattress. The following is a simple summary on the pros and cons of queen and full mattresses.</p> \n<h2>Which size should you consider?</h2> \n<h3>Budget and availability</h3> \n<p>Generally, a full-size mattress is more budget-friendly than a queen, regardless of the brand. The same goes for the price of its accessories. As the most popular mattress size, queen bedding accessories are also more widely available than the full.</p> \n<h3>Height and comfort</h3> \n<p>Full beds are popular with\u00a0those\u00a0who\u00a0sleep\u00a0by themselves as\u00a0they provide the perfect amount of space for a comfortable night. Generally,\u00a0the full bed is not recommended for\u00a0couples, unless they enjoy sleeping in very close contact.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re taller than 6 feet, the queen-size mattress\u00a0is the\u00a0better option, as it provides\u00a0the necessary leg room to sleep comfortably. Queen beds are best for couples, and can somewhat accommodate those\u00a0who share their bed with a baby or small pet.</p> \n<h3>Bedroom dimensions</h3> \n<p>The size of the room is also a key consideration to your new mattress.\u00a0Queen-size mattresses are better for larger rooms and full-size mattresses are better for smaller ones. Queen beds are recommended for master bedrooms that are at least 10 x 12 feet, while the full beds work better\u00a0for guestrooms that are no\u00a0less than 10 x 11 feet. If you are\u00a0living in a studio apartment, the full mattress is\u00a0a more appropriate size and a\u00a0more affordable choice.</p> \n<h3>Sleeping\u00a0positions</h3> \n<p>If you sleep alone and tend to keep the same position all night, a full bed is suitable for you. But if you tend to\u00a0move around in bed\u00a0at night, and prefer a larger surface area, opt for a queen.</p> \n<p>This guide\u00a0is for informational purposes only and should not replace the professional advice from your doctors and/or\u00a0medical consultants.</p> \n<p>Disclaimer\uff1aThe\u00a0information\u00a0set\u00a0forth\u00a0above\u00a0is\u00a0provided\u00a0by\u00a0Sweetnight\u00a0independently of Alibaba.com.

Wooden frames are great if your customers want to add a natural ascent to patios.

The frames are durable and stunning when set with multicolored canopies of different sizes of between 9 and 11 feet in diameter.</p> \n<h3>Simple center pole umbrellas</h3> \n<p>Center pole umbrellasare the most common patio umbrellas out there with a mix of contemporary and traditional materials.

Apatio umbrella with LED lightsis just what you need to provide your customers with the latest high-tech outdoor fittings.</p> \n<p>At night, LEDs illuminate the patio creating a lively scene for patrons to party or just chill outside, conversing warmly. The umbrella can also be handy next to a fire pit as the canopy and ribs are strengthened to withstand strong heat.</p> \n<p>Speaking of designs, LEDs can be in the form of a standard thin light string in the inner tube of the ribs or as a single energy-saving bulb. The former is popular, appealing, and functional on large rectangular or small round canopies.</p> \n<p>Playfully, LEDs can be customized intohanging umbrellasor a Bluetooth umbrella stereo system for tranquil backyards or poolsides.</p> \n<p>From the varied need for patio umbrellas with LEDs, umbrellas orparasols with highly efficient mini-solar panelsare preferred. They can be set up far from civilization, such as on mountain cabins or areas not connected to the electricity grid.</p> \n<p>On a warm sunny day, the small solar panel can charge up the battery in less than three hours to light up the umbrella for more than 7 hours. Optionally, provide your customers with LED umbrellas with disposable batteries that do not require charging and are easy to set up.</p> \n<p>For simplicity, in-built sensors, which at times work with smartphones, and remote controllers automatically light up the umbrella as darkness sets in or allow customers to adjust brightness.</p> \n<h3>Tilt button patio umbrella</h3> \n<p>A tilt umbrella is everything an outdoor enthusiast needs to spend the whole day out. Its canopy can be tilted, rotated, raised, or lowered depending on the sun\u2019s direction, removing the need for homeowners to shift to different shaded positions.</p> \n<p>Unlike many umbrellas,tilt umbrellas for patioscome with heavy portable or fixed bases. Versatile portable bases are recommended as they can be moved together with the umbrella to different places.</p> \n<p>The classic polyester most tilt button umbrellas have stretches out tightly on the arched aluminum or wooden ribs to form the canopy. On top of that, the canopy can be opened by an able cranking system with a mere button push.</p> \n<p>Lastly, other than a nostalgic shade, your customers want a stable structure to hold the canopy in place. Luckily, these umbrellas have strengthened powder-coated and rust-proof steel, varnished hardwood, or shiny aluminum poles.</p> \n<h3>Traditional tiered patio umbrellas</h3> \n<p>As the jewel in the patio umbrella market crown, the last place is reserved for tiered patio umbrellas. They are widely recognized for their unique capabilities in many ways.</p> \n<p>The canopies are round with three beautiful tiers and two vents. The vents and tiers not only add elegance to the patio but also maximize air circulation under the umbrella, providing a permanently cool shade. It works by allowing warm, less dense air from the ground to rise up and escape through the vents.</p> \n<p>Other features include a hand crank system, multicolored canopies, multi-optional bases (cement, marble, steel, or water bases), and in some cases,umbrellas are available in conspicuous customized logos.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>Umbrellas are great at transforming patios and outdoors; that is why their market is growing unprecedently.

As a result, the ergonomic office chair market was valued at$12.8 billionin 2020, and it is expected to reachalmost $30 billion by 2028. This represents aCAGR of nearly 8.5%between the years 2021-2028. With this in mind, be sure to read on and discover which ergonomic office trends your customers are likely to follow in 2022.</p> \n<p>Table of ContentsElegance and minimalism are keyManeuverability, durability, and function can prove indispensableCost effectiveness and ergonomics are of utmost importance</p> \n<p>When deciding which office chair to buy, consumers have generally considered factors such as comfort and quality. Today, however,potential buyersalso look for office chairs that are stylish enough to complement their home d\u00e9cor and providehealth benefits and comfort. In this article, we will explore major trends and the most popular chair models that best represent them.</p> \n<h2>Elegance and minimalism are key</h2> \n<p>The most popular office chairs have almost always been minimalist in their design. By using high-density foam insets andmesh ergonomic backrests, suppliers have managed to provide light-weight and affordable options for consumers. This gives them the option of providing high level fashion and comfort to their consumers at a fraction of the usual price.</p> \n<p>Elegant curves and angles are pleasing to the eye, as are neat designs that allow for adjustability. By utilizingbutterfly mechanisms, ergonomic office chair manufacturers have grown more and more adept at concealing the nuts and bolts of their creations. This in turn has given rise to a simple, sleek aesthetic that has been popular in home furniture now for almost a century, since the creation of the now iconic Barcelona Chair. It is crazy to think that this type of design, perfected in 1929, is labeled as modernist \u2014 despite now being close to a hundred years old. Yet minimal and modernist designs remain extremely popular to this very day \u2014 the very definition of a stable trend.</p> \n<h2>Maneuverability, durability, and function can prove indispensable</h2> \n<p>Many of the most popular ergonomic chair choices among consumers have a high degree of versatility, durability, and maneuverability. This meanshigh-quality productscan be regarded as a long-term investment \u2014 rather thana disposable, quick purchase. This can also build brand loyalty, as consumers who have had their needs met are almost certain to return.</p> \n<p>Ergonomic office chair manufacturers have long understood the need for functionality in their products. Withswivel bases set upon large wheelsand adjustable settings, the most popular office chairs are built in a way that allows for easy movement across any indoor surface. Durable designs through hardy materials, such as hard plastic and metal, as well as clever use of weight distribution on the elements of the chair makes this option possible, while such usage with weaker products is bound to create problems. By ensuring that products are built from robust materials, including solid and unbending metals, woods, and plastics, businesses can ensure the maximum security for their customers. Some specific hard materials include the likes of strong but light titanium, oak wood, or injection molded plastics.</p> \n<h2>Cost effectiveness and ergonomics are of the utmost importance</h2> \n<p>Cost effectiveness has always been a key concern for consumers, andnow perhaps more than ever. Simplicity has never been a problem for potential buyers, as long as the price of the product in question reflects such minimalism. Office chairs that somehow manage to incorporate ergonomic designs whilemaintaining a lower priceare seen as a huge plus, as some of themore popular modelson the market show.</p> \n<p>Chairsthat offer spinal and lumbar support at a lower price provide much needed relief to the spines of those that need it most. Research has shown that ergonomic furniture can provide all sorts ofhealth benefits, from lowering blood pressure to decreased levels of stress and anxiety. In fact, some studies have even gone so far as to imply that home office productivity can beincreasedby implementing ergonomics into the workspace properly. It is believed that, if implemented correctly, ergonomic chairs can improve productivity from10% to 15%.</p> \n<p>Other aspects that make great selling ergonomic features include height adjustments, comfortable armrests, cup holders and plugs. When choosing ergonomic chairs, consider each part of the body \u2014 a chair that is too low will mean that the user\u2019s knees are too high, which in turn will affect the whole posture. Over a long period, this will cause severe discomfort, reduce productivity, and can lead to long-term issues.</p> \n<p>The same goes for armrests that are too slim or too bulky, since the users\u2019 arms will slip off or the armests will get in the way when working on the computer. Additional features, such as cup holders and plugs add that extra layer of ease, comfort, and luxury, and are certainly worth investing in for a more luxurious workstation.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Different products are suited to different needs and different customers, however, with trends leaning toward maneuverability, functionality, durability, style, and cost-effectiveness, we can make stable predictions on what customers will be buying this year. The office chair types discussed in this article represent some of the qualities that buyers will be looking for this year.</p> \n<p>By providing maximum comfort and style, as well as competitive costs for their customers, companies will have a good chance of putting themselves in the driver\u2019s seat and creating a consumer-supplier relationship that will last longer than any fleeting trend ever could. The need for home-based office equipment is rising, and the question everyone is asking is: \u201cWill suppliers be able to meet the growing demands of consumers for the upcoming year?\u201d</p> \n"}]}

Below are some of the hottest dining room furniture set trends buyers should be focusing on right now.</p> \n<h3>Long-lasting style</h3> \n<p>There are several dining room furniture styles available on the market now, including traditional, modern, contemporary, transitional, vintage, and rustic style \u2014 to name a few. Generally, most people stick with a traditional or modern style when it comes to dining room decoration, as these two styles are the most widely known and well-received.</p> \n<p>The traditional dining room style often disperses a sense of formality and is normally made of wood. From a design perspective, the traditional furniture style is widely reckoned by furniture industry experts, such as this home design media and anaward-winning interior design company, as a timeless style. This means both elegance and comfort, on top of dark, warm colors, curvy design, and a welcoming relaxed feel. In other words, traditional dining room sets are a mix of classic and homely components that create a flexible option for a variety of occasions. These multipurpose traits make them an ideal wholesale dining set furniture option for stock selection.</p> \n<p>Amodern design dining room set, on the other hand, is usually furnished with a marble or glass dining table, supported by an iron or stainless steel base, which all the while exudes formality. Modern dining room sets commonly highlight minimalism with a uniform color scheme \u2014 usually with brighter colors, such as white or light colors. They also emphasize cleaner, simpler lines and fewer items, thereby maintaining a clean, unfussy approach. Simple attributes such as these do wonders in today\u2019s metropolitan and compact living conditions, making them a great option for couples or small families.</p> \n<p>The below image shows a transitional style dining room table and chairs, which is essentially a combination of both traditional and modern designs, combining a wooden top and an iron base. Such transitional style offers a good alternative to both traditional and modern style, extracting the best of both styles to provide a well-mixed, all-embracing balance between formality and simplicity.</p> \n<p>In terms of shapes and sizes, a round table takes up less space than a rectangular table, since it has no corners. This structure also allows for greater ease of movement and more seating capacity if needed, as it is not limited to a typical 4-6 seating size.</p> \n<h3>Space-efficient</h3> \n<p>Household dining space today is used for many purposes, not just dining. The unspoken reason behind this is the inevitable space-deprived urban living style. Thankfully, however, smart, extendable dinner table solutions do exist.</p> \n<p>In the picture above, the darker component at the table\u2019s center is an extension leaf. Amodern extendable dining table setlike this typically works through a simple mechanism which easily allows the host to pull out the extension leaf in the middle section of the dining tabletop, thereby increasing the overhang at each end of the dining table \u2014 and thus increasing table length.</p> \n<p>There are other creative options besides this extension design, such as butterfly leaf extensions and drop leaf extensions. The butterfly leaf extension is named after its concealed and folded extension leaf, which also pulls out from the middle part of a dining table. Dining tables with a drop leaf, on the other hand, feature attached leaves that can be folded down or extended fully, making it possible to be placed against a wall for more space.</p> \n<p>Another way to create more room in a small space is by using a dining table that comes with matching chairs that are concealable underneath it. Alternatively, one can also opt for a more adaptabledining table set that can pair with both chairs and benches, thereby allowing more space.</p> \n<h3>Comfort</h3> \n<p>With the constant advancements in e-commerce, people are now paying fewer visits to brick and mortar furniture stores. However, this is not without exceptions, especially when it comes to testing how comfortable the furniture is.People.comembarked on a quest to pinpoint what makes a dining chair comfortable, concluding that for people to feel snug enough in their dining space, the dining chairs should be upholstered, ideally on both backrest and seat, and have an ergonomic design. With these points in mind, aleather cushioned dining chairor a velvet padded dining chair may well fit the cozy goal.</p> \n<p>Put simply, both materials and ergonomic design play an important role in ensuring a comfortable experience for the sitter. Material-wise, cotton, silk, leather, and wool are some of the most highly regarded and sought after natural upholstery fabrics for comfort.</p> \n<p>Concerning the ergonomic design of the dining chair, meanwhile, it should be optimized to support the human body, keeping in mind posture and comfort. For example, a comfortableergonomic chairmay incorporate ergonomic elements such as a slightly scooped seat, cushion, armrest, and a curved top rail to provide good support to the shoulders and back.</p> \n<h2>A quick review</h2> \n<p>In a nutshell, when considering dining room set options, there are three main points not to be missed: long-lasting style, space efficiency, and dining chair comfort.

The global recliner chair market was valued at US$3.7 billionin 2021, and by 2027, it is expected to reachUS $5.1 billion.</p> \n<p>These figures show a market with positive prospects. A number of reasons can be attributed to the rising demand seen for recliner chairs, both on the demand and supply sides. On the demand side, there has been growing consumer demand for high-end luxury and comfort furniture globally (this has been most prominent among urban, millennial populations).</p> \n<p>Pandemic-driven lockdown mandates have led to a significant proportion of the population working and learning from home, and in turn, growing demand for products that can help to minimize back and neck pain when seated.</p> \n<p>Another factor driving the increased demand is the supply-side technological innovation that has seen recliner chairs being upgraded from mere seats to full-on tech units equipped with features such as USB charging, Bluetooth speakers, heating systems, massage motors, bar fridges, and many others.</p> \n<p>Other factors such as the advent of customized recliner chairs, the high adaptability of modern designs, growing geriatric populations across many markets, and the wide availability of recliner chairs both online and offline, will also be fueling the growth of the global recliner market in the near future.</p> \n<h2>Recliner chair trends to look out for in 2022</h2> \n<p>With a full appreciation of the key drivers fueling the direction and growth of the global recliner chair market, we can now delve into the key trends popular among consumers that retailers should be looking out for in 2022 and beyond.</p> \n<h3>Mixing and matching</h3> \n<p>Gone are the days when recliner chairs were standalone pieces that did not blend in with the rest of the decor in homes. Now, users have become pickier about the pieces they incorporate as they would like them to match effortlessly with the rest of the furniture.</p> \n<p>As a result, consumers will be looking for recliner pieces that complement their other living room pieces, meaning that there needs to be a varied range of recliner designs that accommodate different styles, from single-color minimalist styles to multi-color statement pieces. If the consumer already has brown sofas, they will be looking for recliners that are a complementary shade of brown.</p> \n<p>Beyond this, some consumers are also looking for recliners that play around with design elements and incorporate unique styles such as mixed and matched fabrics on one furniture piece. The color mixes can be in the style of neutral colors that complement each other, or even contrast colors such as black and pink that stand out and bring out the consumers\u2019 unique style.</p> \n<p>You can either havereclinerswith neutral-color mixing and matching orreclinerswith contrast-color mixing and matching.</p> \n<h3>Keeping it simple</h3> \n<p>Minimalism has grown in popularity over the past few years as consumers exhibit a greater inclination for either consuming less or producing less waste as part of sustainable lifestyles.

Whole neighborhoods like the one of Notting Hill in London wouldn\u2019t be so famous if it wasn\u2019t for its iconic streets full of colorful doors. We can all remember the visual impact of the famous purple door from Friends, the internationally famous TV show from the 90s; or the uniqueness of The Hobbit\u2019s round doors.</p> \n<p>However, uniqueness isn\u2019t the only factor to take into account.

From the most classic designs to the more modern and bold ones, this design offers a large variety of options to choose from. They provide lots of light, thus making entry halls look more spacious. Some people prefer full glass front doors, while others feel comfortable with more moderate options which can provide greater privacy. For full glass casement doors, noise and thermal insulating materials are the way to go. Reflective glass is another good option to offer to your customers as it\u2019ll keep any peepers away.</p> \n<p>The larger the glass, the more important it is to match the rest of the door with the windows. A casement door will always look more appealing if the materials and color of the windows are the same. For those with small glass panels, solid wood is a common and popular option. For doors with large panels, simple, metallic structures are the safest bet as homeowners will prefer the attention to be focused on the glass.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, you should always offer toughened glass to guarantee the safety of your customers!</p> \n<p>Just as we\u2019ve seen before, the larger the glass, the more attention should be drawn to it. Small panels will allow both neutral colors like darks and browns and colorful tones like blue, green, and red. Large panels, on the other hand, will look a lot better with neutral tones (black, white\u2026) as they will blend with the glass panels and make them look larger. A red structure with large panels would stand out too much, so homeowners risk getting tired of it over time. As much as it is important to keep every house\u2019s unique style in mind, in these times of ever-changing trends, people are growing their interest in timeless designs and colors that don\u2019t go outdated after a few years.</p> \n<h3>Double arch doors</h3> \n<p>Majestic and elegant, opening a pair ofdouble arch doorsfeels just like going through the doors of a castle. On top of that, they are extremely practical for families as they allow them to get baby carts, bikes, or large shopping without risking damaging the doors. They are also great to move furniture in and out of the house (in the not-so-common but stressful instances when that is needed), and your customers will be able to open just one of the doors when they don\u2019t need to use both. For all those reasons, double arch doors are gaining more and more attention every year. Homeowners are now looking for larger homes in suburban areas, so more and more of them are considering the convenience of larger home entrances.</p> \n<p>Trends haven\u2019t changed much over the years when it comes to double arch doors. People are still going with hardwoods such as sapele mahogany, Spanish, and western red cedar. Adding translucent and see-through glass panels (on the sides, arch, or top of the doors) is also a classy yet favorite choice as it lets more light in. This can give a warmer and more welcoming impression as larger doors in dark tones can also feel more intimidating (especially to visitors!).</p> \n<p>Good quality woods will give these doors all the color they need. Light and dark browns are the most popular choices for large doors as homeowners want to be able to appreciate the tones and texture of the wood itself and not a coat of paint. So let that piece of cedar shine \u201cau naturel.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the natural appeal of wood can be further increased by adding a metallic design inside the glass to add some originality. These should either match the color of the wood or add contrast (i.e. dark brown and gold)</p> \n<h3>Pivot Doors</h3> \n<p>Pivot doorslook stunning in any house. They rotate on a pivot installed within the door itself so the hinges are \u201cinvisible.\u201d This is what makes them look so pretty and why offering them in your product catalog is likely to bring your quick profit. Some of thereasonsthey are so looked after are that they are a lot more stable and stronger than traditional doors, are available in larger sizes, and offer a wider view to those interested in doors with glass panels. They also require smaller frames as there are no hinges that need to be installed.</p> \n<p>Although they look notably good on larger sizes, homeowners are also showing their interest in regular-sized pivot doors. This is because they can be made in any size, they are easier to open and close and, by not needing large frames, can help to save space. Their cost is often higher than that of traditional doors, but the stability and look it will give to any entrance is not something you can easily forget about.</p> \n<p>Pivot doors are extremely versatile when it comes to materials. They go well with solid timber woods such asmahogany, oak, and teak. Metal designs are also interesting for a section of homeowners, as well as large glass doors (although this last one is more often installed in rear doors facing the garden).</p> \n<p>Wooden doors with some kind of see-through addition such as sidelights are definitely the winners here. They are an excellent way to provide sunlight without having to give up the impressiveness of a quality wooden pivot door.</p> \n<p>A great advantage of pivot doors is that they look great in almost any color. However, people are still opting for neutral dark and light tones (like black and off-white), dark blues, and no paint at all to fully appreciate the wood. For glass doors, a black or dark metal frame is a common option. Metal designs are popular in dark colors, too.</p> \n<p>What is sure, nevertheless, is that the majority of homeowners choosing pivot doors are generally more interested in neutral and not too extravagant colors to make sure that their superb home entrances don\u2019t go outdated anytime soon.</p> \n<h3>Iron French Doors</h3> \n<p>Few designs can beat the elegance of aniron French door. They are the go-to choice for the more romantic and classic folks as the iron structure accepts all sorts of patterns like flowers, leaves, and twists. They allow sunlight to enter the home while still looking strong and safe.</p> \n<p>Iron French doors are especially popular among those looking forlow-maintenance, safe doors. They can be more expensive but they are with no doubt a good investment as they last longer and can be easily restored if needed.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that iron French doors are usually made with iron. Regarding the glass panels, fiberglass is a popular choice as well as transparent, reflective, and transparent glass. Homeowners usually prefer panels with thermal and noise insulating features to keep their spaces warm and quiet.</p> \n<p>Black is the by-default choice for iron doors. The contrast of the dark metal with the light glass is probably the best and most classical possible combination. This also makes it much easier to combine with the rest of the entry and the interior of the house. Therefore, taking risks here is not really advised.</p> \n<h2>Final thoughts about trending front doors</h2> \n<p>As we have seen, casement, double arch, pivot, and iron French doors are some of the dominant trends in 2022.Homeowners are generally looking for functional, spacious, and bright entries with wide doors and glass panels that let the light in. They are also looking for insulating and good quality materials, neutral, and natural tones.</p> \n<p>As work-from-home becomes more popular among companies and people spend more time at home,their concern for having a practical and comfy indoor space also grows. Exterior entry doors are now more than ever being carefully considered. As a business owner, having a clear idea of what trends are in vogue is vital to stay competitive.</p> \n"}]}
